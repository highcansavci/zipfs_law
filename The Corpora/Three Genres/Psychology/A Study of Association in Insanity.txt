association in normal subjects 


among the most striking and commonly observed manifestations of
insanity are certain disorders of the flow of utterance which appear
to be dependent upon a derangement of the psychical processes commonly
termed association of ideas  these disorders have to some extent been
made the subject of psychological experimentation  and the object of
this investigation is to continue and extend the study of these
phenomena by an application of the experimental method known as the
association test 



  1  method of investigation 


in this investigation we have followed a modified form of the method
developed by sommer  1  the essential feature of which is the
statistical treatment of results obtained by uniform technique from a
large number of cases 

 footnote 1  diagnostik der geisteskrankheiten  p  112  

the stimulus consists of a series of one hundred spoken words  to each
of which the subject is directed to react by the first word which it
makes him think of  in the selection of the stimulus words  sixty six
of which were taken from the list suggested by sommer  we have taken
care to avoid such words as are especially liable to call up personal
experiences  and have so arranged the words as to separate any two
which bear an obviously close relation to one another  after much
preliminary experimentation we adopted the following list of words 

01 table
02 dark
03 music
04 sickness
05 man
06 deep
07 soft
08 eating
09 mountain
10 house
11 black
12 mutton
13 comfort
14 hand
15 short
16 fruit
17 butterfly
18 smooth
19 command
20 chair
21 sweet
22 whistle
23 woman
24 cold
25 slow
26 wish
27 river
28 white
29 beautiful
30 window
31 rough
32 citizen
33 foot
34 spider
35 needle
36 red
37 sleep
38 anger
39 carpet
40 girl
41 high
42 working
43 sour
44 earth
45 trouble
46 soldier
47 cabbage
48 hard
49 eagle
50 stomach

no attempt is made to secure uniformity of external conditions for the
test  the aim has been rather to make it so simple as to render
strictly experimental conditions unnecessary  the test may be made in
any room that is reasonably free from distracting influences  the
subject is seated with his back toward the experimenter  so that he
cannot see the record  he is requested to respond to each stimulus
word by one word  the first word that occurs to him other than the
stimulus word itself  and on no account more than one word  if an
untrained subject reacts by a sentence or phrase  a compound word  or
a different grammatical form of the stimulus word  the reaction is
left unrecorded  and the stimulus word is repeated at the close of the
test 

in this investigation no account is taken of the reaction time  the
reasons for this will be explained later 

the general plan has been first to apply the test to normal persons 
so as to derive empirically a normal standard and to determine  if
possible  the nature and limits of normal variation  and then to apply
it to cases of various forms of insanity and to compare the results
with the normal standard  with a view to determining the nature of
pathological variation 



  2  the normal standard 


in order to establish a standard which should fairly represent at
least all the common types of association and which should show the
extent of such variation as might be due to differences in sex 
temperament  education  and environment  we have applied the test to
over one thousand normal subjects 

among these subjects were persons of both sexes and of ages ranging
from eight years to over eighty years  persons following different
occupations  possessing various degrees of mental capacity and
education  and living in widely separated localities  many were from
ireland  and some of these had but recently arrived in this country 
others were from different parts of europe  but all were able to speak
english with at least fair fluency  over two hundred of the subjects 
including a few university professors and other highly practiced
observers  were professional men and women or college students  about
five hundred were employed in one or another of the new york state
hospitals for the insane  either as nurses and attendants or as
workers at various trades  the majority of these were persons of
common school education  but the group includes also  on the one hand 
a considerable number of high school graduates  and on the other hand 
a few laborers who were almost or wholly illiterate  nearly one
hundred and fifty of the subjects were boys and girls of high school
age  pupils of the ethical culture school  new york city  the
remaining subjects form a miscellaneous group  consisting largely of
clerks and farmers 



  3  the frequency tables 


from the records obtained from these normal subjects  including in all
100 000 reactions  we have compiled a series of tables  one for each
stimulus word  showing all the different reactions given by one
thousand subjects in response to that stimulus word  and the frequency
with which each reaction has occurred   1  these tables will be found
at the end of this paper 

 footnote 1  a similar method of treating associations has been used
by cattell  mind  vol  xii  p  68  vol  xiv  p  230   and more
recently by reinhold  zeitschr  f  psychol   vol  liv  p  183   but
for other purposes  

with the exception of a few distinctive proper names  which are
indicated by initials  we have followed the plan of introducing each
word into the table exactly as it was found in the record  in the
arrangement of the words in each table  we have placed together all
the derivatives of a single root  regardless of the strict
alphabetical order  1 

 footnote 1  it should be mentioned that we have discovered a few
errors in these tables  some of these were made in compiling them from
the records  and were evidently due to the assistant s difficulty of
reading a strange handwriting  other errors have been found in the
records themselves  each of the stimulus words  butter    tobacco  and
 king  appears from the tables to have been repeated by a subject as a
reaction  such a reaction  had it occurred  would not have been
accepted  and it is plain that the experimenter wrote the stimulus
word in the space where the reaction word should have been written 
still other errors were due to the experimenter s failure to speak
with sufficient distinctness when reading off the stimulus words 
thus  the reaction  barks  in response to  dark  indicates that the
stimulus word was probably understood as  dog   and the reactions
 blue  and  color  in response to  bread  indicate that the stimulus
word was understood as  red   

the total number of different words elicited in response to any
stimulus word is limited  varying from two hundred and eighty words in
response to  anger  to seventy two words in response to  needle  
furthermore  for the great majority of subjects the limits are still
narrower  to take a striking instance  in response to  dark  eight
hundred subjects gave one or another of the following seven words 
 light  night  black  color  room  bright  gloomy   while only two
hundred gave reactions other than these words  and only seventy
subjects  out of the total number of one thousand  gave reactions
which were not given by any other subject 

if any record obtained by this method be examined by referring to the
frequency tables  the reactions contained in it will fall into two
classes  the  common  reactions  those which are to be found in
the tables  and the  individual  reactions  those which are not
to be found in the tables  for the sake of accuracy  any reaction word
which is not found in the table in its identical form  but which is a
grammatical variant of a word found there  may be classed as

 doubtful  

the value of any reaction may be expressed by the figure representing
the percentage of subjects who gave it  thus the reaction 
 table  chair   which was given by two hundred and sixty seven
out of the total of our one thousand subjects  possesses a value of
26 7 per cent  the significance of this value from the clinical
standpoint will be discussed later 



  4  normal associational tendencies


the normal subjects gave  on the average  6 8 per cent of individual
reactions  1 5 per cent of doubtful ones  and 91 7 cent of common
ones  the range of variation was rather wide  a considerable number of
subjects giving no individual reactions at all  while a few gave over
30 per cent  1 

 footnote 1  in the study of the reactions furnished by our normal
subjects it was possible to analyze the record of any subject only by
removing it from the mass of material which forms our tables  and
using as the standard of comparison the reactions of the remaining 999
subjects  

in order to determine the influence of age  sex  and education upon
the tendency to give reactions of various values  we have selected
three groups of subjects for special study   1  one hundred persons of
collegiate or professional education   2  one hundred persons of
common school education  employed in one of the state hospitals as
attendants  but not as trained nurses  and  3  seventy eight children
under sixteen years of age  the reactions given by these subjects have
been classified according to frequency of occurrence into seven
groups   a  individual reactions  value 0    b  doubtful reactions
 value ¬±    c  reactions given by one other person  value 0 1 per
cent    d  those given by from two to five others  value 0 2  0 5 per
cent    e  those given by from six to fifteen others  value 0 6 1 5
per cent    f  those given by from sixteen to one hundred others
 value 1 6  10 0 per cent   and  g  those given by more than one
hundred others  value over 10 0 per cent   the averages obtained from
these groups of subjects are shown in table 1  and the figures for men
and women are given separately

it will be observed that the proportion of individual reactions given
by the subjects of collegiate education is slightly above the general
average for all subjects  while that of each of the other classes is
below the general average  in view  however  of the wide limits of
variation  among the thousand subjects  these deviations from the
general average are no larger than might quite possibly occur by
chance  and the number of cases in each group is so small that the
conclusion that education tends to increase the number of individual
reactions would hardly be justified 

it will be observed also that this comparative study does not show any
considerable differences corresponding to age or sex 

with regard to the type of reaction  it is possible to select groups
of records which present more or less consistently one of the
following special tendencies   1  the tendency to react by contrasts 
 2  the tendency to react by synonyms or other defining terms  and  3 
the tendency to react by qualifying or specifying terms  how clearly
the selected groups show these tendencies is indicated by table
ii  the majority of records  however  present no such tendency in a
consistent way  nor is there any evidence to show that these
tendencies  when they occur  are to be regarded as manifestations of
permanent mental characteristics  since they might quite possibly be
due to a more or less accidental and transient associational
direction  no further study has as yet been made of these tendencies 
for the reason that they do not appear to possess any pathological
significance

  5  practical considerations 


this method is so simple that it requires but little training on the
part of the experimenter  and but little co operation on the part of
the subject  it is not to be assumed that every reaction obtained by
it is a true and immediate association to the corresponding stimulus
word  but we have found it sufficient for the purpose of the test if
the subject can be induced to give  in response to each stimulus word 
any one word other than the stimulus word itself  no attempt is made
to determine the exact degree of co operation in any case 

in the early stages of this investigation the reaction time was
regularly recorded  the results showed remarkable variations  among
both normal and insane subjects  in a series of twenty five tests 
made more recently upon normal subjects  ninety reactions occupied
more than ten seconds  and fifty four of the stimulus words elicited a
ten second response from at least one subject  1 

 footnote 1  these tests were made by dr  f  lyman wells  of the
mclean hospital  waverley  mass   and he has kindly furnished these
data  

it is noteworthy that these extremely long intervals occur in
connection with reactions of widely differing values  that they are by
no means limited to individual reactions is shown in table iii  by a
group of selected reactions  all given by normal subjects 


table iii 

word combination   reaction time    value of
                    in seconds      reaction

short  long              11           27 9%
smooth  plane            16            2 3%
woman  lady              40            4 1%
hard  iron               12            2 4%
justice  judge           20            9 1%
memory  thought          20            8 1%
joy  pleasure            18           12 1%


it is apparent  even from a superficial examination of the material 
that the factors which cause variations of reaction time  both in the
normal state and in pathological states  are numerous and complex 

it has been the purpose of this study to establish as far as possible
strictly objective criteria for distinguishing normal from abnormal
associations  and for this reason we have made no attempt to determine
by means of introspection the causes of variations of reaction time 

it would seem that the importance and magnitude of the problem of
association time are such as to demand not merely a crude measurement
of the gross reaction time in a large number of cases  but rather a
special investigation by such exact methods as have been used by
cattell  1  and others in the analysis of the complex reaction  it
would be impracticable for us to employ such methods in a study so
extensive as this 

 footnote 1  mind  vol  xi  1886  

in view of these considerations we discontinued the recording of the
reaction time 

if the association test is to be useful in the study of pathological
conditions  it is of great importance to have a reliable measure of
the associational value of a pair of ideas  many attempts have been
made to modify and amplify the classical grouping of associations
according to similarity  contrast  contiguity  and sequence  so as to
make it serviceable in differentiating between normal and abnormal
associations 

in this study we attempted to apply aschaffenburg s  1  classification
of reactions  but without success  our failure to utilize this system
of classification is assigned to the following considerations   1 
distinctions between associations according to logical relations are
extremely difficult to define  in many cases there is room for
difference of opinion as to the proper place for an association  and
thus the application of a logical scheme depends largely upon the
personal equation of the observer  that even experienced observers
cannot  in all cases  agree in placing an association is shown by
aschaffenburg s criticisms of the opinions of other observers on this
point  2   2  logical distinctions do not bring out clearly the
differences between the reactions of normal subjects and those of
insane subjects  logically  the reaction  bath  ink   which was given
by a patient  might be placed in the class with the reaction
 bath  water   although there is an obvious difference between the two
reactions   3  many of the reactions given by insane subjects possess
no obvious logical value whatever  but since any combination of ideas
may represent a relationship  either real or imagined  it would be
arbitrary to characterize such a reaction as incoherent 

 footnote 1  experimentelle studien uber association  psychologische
arbeiten  vol  i  p  209  vol  ii  p  1  vol  iv  p  235  

 footnote 2  loc  cit  vol  1  pp  226 227  

the criterion of values which is used in this study is an empirical
one  as has already been explained  p  8   every word contained in the
frequency tables possesses a value of at least 0 1 per cent  and other
words have a zero value  with the aid of our method the difficulty of
classifying the reactions quoted above is obviated  as it is necessary
only to refer to the table to find their proper values  the value of
the reaction  bath  water  is 33 9 per cent  while that of the
reaction  bath  ink  is 0 

logically the combination  health  wealth  may be placed in any
one of four classes  as follows 


                  / intrinsic / causal dependence
  health  wealth /              coordination
                  
                    extrinsic / speech reminiscence
                                sound similarity


but since our table shows this association to have an empirical value
of 7 6 per cent  it becomes immaterial which of its logical relations
is to be considered the strongest  it is mainly important  from our
point of view  to separate reactions possessing an empirical value
from those whose value is zero 



  6  an empirical principle of normal association 


on a general survey of the whole mass of material which forms the
basis of the first part of this study  we are led to observe that
 the one tendency which appears to be almost universal among normal
persons is the tendency to give in response to any stimulus word one
or another of a small group of common reactions  

it appears from the pathological material now on hand that this
tendency is greatly weakened in some cases of mental disease  many
patients have given more than 50 per cent of individual reactions 

it should be mentioned that occasionally a presumably normal subject
has given a record very similar to those obtained from patients  in
respect to both the number and the nature of the individual reactions 
a few subjects who gave peculiar reactions were known to possess
significant eccentricities  and for this reason we excluded their
records from the thousand records which furnished the basis for the
frequency tables  we excluded also a few peculiar records obtained
from subjects of whom nothing was known  on the ground that such
records would serve only to make the tables more cumbersome  without
adding anything to their practical value  the total number of records
thus excluded was seventeen 

it will be apparent to anyone who examines the frequency tables that
the reactions obtained from one thousand persons fall short of
exhausting the normal associational possibilities of these stimulus
words  the tables  however  have been found to be sufficiently
inclusive for the practical purpose which they were intended to
serve  common reactions  whether given by a sane or an insane subject 
may  in the vast majority of instances  safely be regarded as
normal  as to individual reactions  they cannot all be regarded as
abnormal  but they include nearly all those reactions which are worthy
of special analysis in view of their possible pathological
significance  what can be said further of individual reactions 
whether normal or abnormal  will appear in the second part of this
contribution

  1  general survey of pathological material 


the pathological material which forms the basis of the present part of
our study consists mainly of two hundred and forty seven test records
obtained for the most part from patients at the kings park state
hospital 

the different groups from which the cases were selected  together with
the number from each group  are shown in table i 


table i 

dementia pr√¶cox                     108 cases 
paranoic conditions                  33    
epilepsy                             24

alcoholic psychoses                   6    
senile dementia                       4    


a comparison of our pathological with our normal material  en
masse  reveals in the former evidence of a weakening of the normal
tendency to respond by common reactions  this is shown in table ii 


table ii 

                        common     doubtful     individual
                       reactions   reactions    reactions

247 insane subjects      70 7%        2 5%        26 8%


it seems evident from this that pathological significance attaches
mainly to individual reactions  so that our study resolves itself
largely into  1  an analysis and classification of individual
reactions and  2  an attempt to determine what relationship  if any 
exists between the different types of reactions and the different
clinical forms of mental disease 



  2  classification of reactions 


those who have attempted to use the association test in the study of
insanity have felt the need of a practical classification of
reactions  and have at the same time encountered the difficulty of
establishing definite criteria for distinguishing the different groups
from one another  it is a comparatively simple matter to make these
distinctions in a general way and even to formulate a more or less
comprehensive theoretical classification  but there still remains much
difficulty in practice  we have made repeated attempts to utilize
various systems of classification which involve free play of personal
equation in their application  although for us the matter is greatly
simplified by the elimination of all the common reactions with the aid
of the frequency tables  we have nevertheless met with no success  the
distinctions made by either of us have on no occasion fully satisfied 
at the second reading  either the one who made them or the other 
while a comparison of the distinctions made by each of us
independently has shown a disagreement to the extent of 20 35 per
cent 

we sought  therefore  to formulate a classification in which the
various groups should be so defined as to obviate the interference of
personal equation in the work of applying it  hoping thus to achieve
greater accuracy  in this we can lay claim to only partial success 
for  in the first place  having satisfactorily defined a number of
groups  we found it necessary in the end to provide a special group
for unclassified reactions  into which falls more than one third of
the total number of individual reactions  and  in the second place  in
at least two of our groups the play of personal equation has not been
entirely eliminated  so that there is still a possibility of error to
the extent of five per cent of individual reactions  which means
approximately one per cent of the total number of reactions  we have
found  however  that in spite of these shortcomings the classification
here proposed is more serviceable than others which  though more
comprehensive  are at the same time lacking in definiteness 

our classification consists of the following classes  groups and
subdivisions 

i   common reactions  
  1  specific reactions 
  2  non specific reactions 

ii   doubtful reactions  

iii   individual reactions  
  1  normal reactions 
  2  pathological reactions 
    a  derivatives of stimulus words 
    b  partial dissociation 
       a  non specific reactions 
       b  sound reactions 
        a  words 
        b  neologisms 
       c  word complements 
       d  particles of speech 
    c  complete dissociation 
       a  perseveration 
        a  association to preceding stimulus 
        b  association to preceding reaction 
        c  repetition of preceding stimulus 
        d  repetition of previous stimulus 
        e  repetition of preceding reaction 
        f  repetition of previous reaction 
        g  reaction repeated five times  stereotypy  
       b  neologisms without sound relation 
  3  unclassified 



  3  non specific reactions  doubtful reactions 


 non specific reactions    it has already been intimated that common
reactions are in the vast majority of instances to be regarded as
normal  from amongst them  however  a fairly definite group can be
separated out which seems to possess some pathological significance 
namely  the group which we have termed non specific 

in this group are placed words which are so widely applicable as to
serve as more or less appropriate reactions to almost any of our
stimulus words  that such reactions are in value inferior to the
remaining group of common reactions  which we have termed  in
contradistinction   specific reactions   is perhaps sufficiently
obvious  we shall speak later  however  of their occurrence in both
normal and insane cases 

it is not always easy to judge whether or not a given reaction should
be classed as non specific  a study of our material made with special
reference to this type of reactions has enabled us to select the
following list of words  any of which  occurring in response to any
stimulus word  is classed as a non specific reaction 

article  articles
bad
beautiful  beauty
fine
good  goodness
great
happiness  happy
large
man
necessary  necessity
nice

object  noun 
people
person
pleasant  pleasantness  pleasing  pleasure
pretty
small
thinking  thought  thoughts
unnecessary
unpleasant
use  used  useful  usefulness  useless  uselessness  uses  using
woman
work

it should be mentioned that some of these words occur as reactions to
one or several stimulus words with such frequency
  citizen  man   value 27 8 per cent   health  good   value
9 4 per cent  as to acquire in such instances a value as high as that
of strictly specific reactions 

 doubtful reactions  have already been defined  p 40   any
reaction word which is not found in the table in its identical form 
but which is a grammatical variant or derivative of a word found
there  is placed in this group 



  4  individual reactions  explanation of groups and methods of
application 


 normal reactions    inasmuch as the frequency tables do not exhaust all
normal possibilities of reaction  a certain number of reactions which
are essentially normal are to be found among the individual reactions 
in order to separate these from the pathological reactions  we have
compiled an appendix to the frequency tables  consisting mainly of
specific definitions of groups of words to be included under each
stimulus word in our list  this appendix will be found at the end of
this paper 

a word of explanation is perhaps due as to the manner in which the
appendix has been compiled  it was developed in a purely empirical
way  the basis being such individual reactions  given by both normal
and insane subjects  as seemed in our judgment to be obviously normal 

it must be acknowledged that the appendix falls short of all that
might be desired  in the first place  its use involves to some slight
extent the play of personal equation  and it therefore constitutes a
source of error  in the second place  it is in some respects too
inclusive while in other respects it is not sufficiently so  however 
the error due to personal equation is slight  the inclusion of certain
 far fetched  or even frankly pathological reactions may be discounted
by bearing in mind that the general value of this group is not equal
to that of the group of common reactions  and the number of strictly
normal reactions which are not included is after all small  our
experience has shown us that the appendix constitutes an important aid
in the analysis of individual reactions 

 pathological reactions  derivatives of stimulus words    we
place here any reaction which is a grammatical variant or derivative
of a stimulus word  the tendency to give such reactions seems to be
dependent upon a suspension or inhibition of the normal process by
which the stimulus word excites the production of a new concept  for
we have here not a production of a new concept but a mere change in
the form of the stimulus word  as examples of such reactions may be
mentioned   eating  eatables    short  shortness  
 sweet  sweetened    quiet  quietness  

 partial dissociation    we have employed the term dissociation
to indicate a rupture of that bond  whatever be its nature which may
be supposed to exist normally between stimulus and reaction and which
causes normal persons to respond in the majority of instances by
common reactions  and we speak of partial dissociation where there is
still an obvious  though weak and superficial  connection  under this
heading we can differentiate four types 

 non specific reactions  have already been defined  we
distinguish those in this class from those in the class of common
reactions by means of the frequency tables 

 sound reactions    this type requires no explanation  the main
difficulty is to decide what degree of sound similarity between
stimulus and reaction should be deemed sufficient for placing a
reaction under this heading  the total number of different sounds
used in language articulation is  of course  small  so that any two
words are liable to present considerable chance similarity  some
time ago we estimated the average degree of sound similarity between
stimulus words and reaction words in a series of one hundred
test records obtained from normal persons  we found that on
the average 14 53 per cent of the sounds of the stimulus words
were reproduced  in the same order  in the reaction word  our
experience finally led us to adopt the following general rule  a
reaction is to be placed under this heading when fifty per cent of
the sounds of the shorter word of the pair are identical with sounds
of the longer word and are ranged in the same order 

among sound reactions we occasionally find  neologisms   for these a
separate heading is provided  possibly their occurrence may be taken
as an indication of an exaggerated tendency to respond by sound
reactions 

 word compliments    here we include any reaction which  added to the
stimulus word  forms a word  a proper name  or a compound word in
common use 

 particles of speech    under this heading we include articles 
numerals  pronouns  auxiliary verbs  adverbs of time  place and
degree  conjunctions  prepositions  and interjections 

 complete dissociation    here are included reactions which
appear to be entirely unrelated to the corresponding stimulus words 
in the case of such reactions the stimulus words seem to act  as
aschaffenburg has pointed out  merely as signals for discharge  this
subdivision contains several types of reactions which seem to be
dependent upon the phenomenon of perseveration  it contains also the
rather important type of neologisms 

the phenomenon of  preservation  occurs in cases in which one may
observe an abnormal immobility of attention  to react normally to a
series of stimulus words requires on the part of the subject  in the
first place  a certain alertness in order that he may grasp quickly
and clearly the meaning of each word  and  in the second place  a
prompt shifting of the mind from one reaction to the next  when such
mental mobility is lacking the subject is liable to react not by a
response adjusted to the stimulus word  but either by repeating a
previous stimulus or reaction  or by giving a word associated to the
preceding stimulus or reaction 

the names of the different types of reactions included under the
heading of perseveration are sufficiently descriptive  we shall here
refer only to those which require further definition 

 association to preceding stimulus    here is placed any reaction
that is shown by the frequency tables to be related to the stimulus
preceding the one in question  seeming or even obvious relationship 
if not established by reference to the frequency tables  is
disregarded  in the tables  however  the combination may not exist in
direct order but only in reverse order  in which case the reaction is
included here  the following examples may serve as illustrations 

 thief  night 
 lion  pocket book 

 lion  pocket book  is not found in the frequency tables  and is 
therefore  an individual reaction   thief  pocket book   however 
is found there   pocket book  is  therefore  classed in this case
as an association to preceding stimulus 

 table  fork 
 dark  mutton 

 dark  mutton  is not found in the frequency tables 
 table  mutton  is also not found there in the direct order  but
is found in the reverse order  viz    mutton  table  mutton  is 
therefore  classed in this case as an association to preceding
stimulus 

 association to preceding reaction    if either the reaction in
question or the preceding reaction happens to be one of the stimulus
words in our list  and a relationship between the two be found to
exist by reference to the frequency tables  whether in direct or in
reverse order  the reaction in question is classed as an association
to preceding reaction  this is illustrated by the following examples 

 eating  table 
 mountain  floor 

 mountain  floor  is an individual reaction   table  floor 

is found in the frequency tables   floor  is  therefore  classed
as an association to preceding reaction 

 beautiful  flowers 
 window  red 

 window  red  is an individual reaction   red  flowers  is
found in the frequency tables  therefore   red  is classed as an
association to preceding reaction 

in cases in which neither the reaction in question nor the preceding
reaction happens to be one of our stimulus words  but a relationship
between them may be judged to exist without considerable doubt  the
reaction in question is also classed here  example 

 priest  father 
 ocean  mother 

 ocean  mother  is an individual reaction  neither the word
 father  nor the word  mother  is among our stimulus words 
but the association between the words  father  and  mother 
may be judged to exist without considerable doubt  therefore  in this
case  mother  is classed as an association to preceding reaction 

in such cases as this personal equation must necessarily come into
play  comparative uniformity of judgment may  however  be attained by
systematically excluding any reaction the relationship of which to the
preceding reaction is subject to any considerable doubt and by placing
any such reaction in the unclassified group 

 repetition of previous stimulus    here we place any reaction
which is a repetition of any previous stimulus from amongst the ten
next preceding  at the same time placing  repetition of preceding
stimulus  under a separate heading 

 neologisms    here we place the newly coined words  so commonly
given by the insane  excepting such as possess a sound relationship to
the stimulus word  for which  as already stated  a special place in
the classification has been provided 

neologisms might be divided into three types  as follows   1  those
which arise from ignorance of language   comfort  uncomfort 
short  diminiature     2  distortions of actual words  apparently
of pathological origin and not due to ignorance   hungry  foodation 
thief  dissteal    and  3  those which seem to be without any
meaning whatever   scack  gehimper  hanrow  dicut    it is 
however  impossible to draw clear cut distinctions between these
types  and for this reason we have made no provision in our
classification for such division 

 unclassified reactions    this group is important  in the first
place  because it is numerically a large one  and in the second place 
because it contains certain fairly definite types of reactions which
are placed here for the sole reason that we have not been able to find
strictly objective criteria for their differentiation from other
types 

it has already been stated that the frequency tables  even together
with the appendix  fail to exhaust all normal possibilities of
association  so that a certain small number of perfectly normal
reactions must fall into the unclassified group  we submit the
following examples 

 music  listen 
 smooth  suave 
 sour  curdled 
 earth  mound 

another type of reactions found in the unclassified group  though also
normal  yet not obviously so until explained by the subject  is
represented by those which originate from purely personal experiences 
such as the following  given by normal subjects 

 blossom  t      
 hammer  j      

the first of these reactions is explained by the subject s acquaintance
with a young lady  miss t      who has been nick named  blossom   and
the second is explained by the subject s having among her pupils at
school a boy by the name of j     hammer 

it would be difficult to estimate the proportion of such reactions in
the unclassified group  but we have gained the general impression that
it is small  an attempt to place them in a separate group could be
made only with the aid of explanations from the subjects  such aid in
the case of insane subjects is generally unreliable  moreover  to
class these reactions as strictly normal would perhaps be going too
far  since their general value is obviously inferior to that of the
common reactions  and in any case in which they are given in unusually
large numbers they must be regarded as manifestation of a tendency to
depart from the normal to the extent to which they displace common
reactions  the next type of reactions met with in the unclassified
group is characterized by a peculiarly superficial  or non essential 
or purely  circumstantial  relationship to the stimulus  such
reactions  though occasionally given by normal subjects  are more
often given by insane ones  and seem to be somewhat characteristic of
states of mental deterioration which are clinically rather loosely
described as puerilism  we offer the following examples  given by
normal subjects 

 music  town 
 sickness  summer 
 child  unknown 
 house  enter 

still another type of reactions to be considered in this connection
consists of words which are in no way related to the corresponding
stimulus words  but which arise from  distraction  of the subject
by surrounding objects  sounds  and the like  in some cases the
experimenter may be able to judge from the direction of the subject s
gaze  from a listening attitude  and so on  that certain reactions are
due to distraction  in other cases  particularly in cases of normal
subjects  the fact that certain reactions are due to distraction may
be determined by questioning the subject on this point immediately
after making the test  in work with insane subjects  as we have
several times had occasion to point out  such aid is generally not
available 

the group of unclassified reactions includes also one more type of
reactions which are of great importance both numerically and
otherwise  these are the  incoherent reactions   that is to say 
reactions which are determined neither by the stimulus words  nor by
the agency of perseveration  nor by distraction 

although the occurrence of incoherent reactions is hardly subject to
doubt  yet in no instance is it possible to establish with certainty
that a given reaction is of this type  for in no instance can a
remote  or an imagined  or a merely symbolic relationship between
stimulus and reaction be positively excluded  some  indeed  would
assert that some such relationship must necessarily exist in every
instance  at least in the domain of the subconscious  this
circumstance necessitates the placing of this type of reactions in the
unclassified group 

in practice it may be found advisable in some cases to analyze the
unclassified reactions with a view to ascertaining to what extent each
of the various types is represented among them  but one here treads on
slippery ground  and one must be continually warned against the danger
of erroneous conclusions 



  5  order of preference 


after having developed the classification here proposed we found that
there was still considerable room for difference of opinion in the
placing of many reactions  owing to the circumstance that in many
cases a reaction presents features which render it assignable under
any one of two or more headings  to leave the matter of preference in
grouping  to be decided in each case according to the best judgment of
the experimenter would mean introducing again the play of personal
equation  and would thus court failure of all our efforts to
accomplish a standardization of the association test  therefore  the
necessity of establishing a proper order of preference for guidance in
the application of the classification became to us quite apparent 

in the arrangement of the order of preference we were guided mainly by
two principles  namely   i  as between two groups of unequal
definition  the one which is more clearly defined and which 
therefore  leaves less play for personal equation is to be preferred 
 2  as between two groups of equal definition  the one which possesses
the greater pathological significance is to be preferred  in
accordance with these principles we have adopted the order of
preference shown in table iii   placing every reaction under the
highest heading on the list under which it may be properly classed

  6  errors involved in the use of arbitrary objective standards 


it may readily be seen that such definiteness and uniformity as this
classification possesses results from the introduction of more or less
arbitrary criteria for the differentiation of the various types of
reactions  the question might arise  to what extent do the
distinctions thus made correspond to reality  to consider  for
instance  our rule for the placing of sound reactions  50 per cent of
the sounds of the shorter word to be present  in the same order  in
the other word   when a given reaction   man  minstrel   is in
accordance with the rule assigned under the heading of sound
reactions  can it be assumed that sound similarity and not some other
relationship is the determining factor of the association in question 
or when in  a given instance   cabbage  cobweb   the sound
similarity falls somewhat short of the standard required by the rule 
can it be assumed that sound similarity is not  after all  the
determining factor 

similar questions may  of course  arise in connection with other
subdivisions 

it must  indeed  be conceded that objective methods can reveal but
indirectly and with uncertainty the inner mechanism which produces any
association and that in any given instance it would be impossible to
establish the correctness of grouping in accordance with such

methods  however  to decide that question for any given reaction is
really not necessary in practice  since an error made through wrongly
placing one  two  or three reactions tinder any heading is of no
significance  the types acquire importance only when represented by
large numbers in a record under consideration  and when many reactions
fall tinder a single heading the likelihood of error  as affecting the
record as a whole  is by that fact alone greatly reduced 

the whole question might more profitably be approached from another
point of view  to what extent are the distinctions of this
classification useful  an answer to this question can be found only in
the results 



  7  analysis of pathological material


we present in table iv  the results of a statistical examination of
the records obtained from certain groups of normal subjects and from
some groups of insane subjects 

the normal groups have been studied for the purpose of determining the
frequency and manner of occurrence among normal subjects of the
various of abnormal reactions  it seemed best for this purpose to
consider separately the records of those subjects who gave an
unusually large number of individual reactions  fifty three records
containing fifteen or more individual reactions were found after a
fairly diligent search among our normal test records  in the other
groups of subjects  persons of common school education  persons of
collegiate education  and children  we included no records containing
more than ten individual reactions 

the more striking departures from average normal figures are indicated
in the table by the use of heavy type 

this table reveals associational tendencies as occurring in connection
with the psychoses studied  a better insight into the nature of these
tendencies can be gained by a special analysis of the test of each
clinical group 


dementia pr√¶cox

in this psychosis we find the number of individual reactions far
exceeding not only that of the normal but that of any other psychosis
which we studied  to a corresponding extent we find the number of the
highest type of normal reactions  the common specific
reactions  reduced

while almost every type of individual reactions shows here an increase
over the normal averages  the most striking increases are shown by the
table to be in the groups of unclassified reactions  neologisms  sound
reactions  and some types of perseveration  a further examination of
the individual test records shows that there is no uniformity of
associational tendencies in this clinical group  but that several
tendencies are more or less frequently met with either alone or in
various combinations  yet some of these tendencies  when appearing at
all prominently  are so highly characteristic of dementia pr√¶cox as to
be almost pathognomonic  among these may be mentioned   1  the
tendency to give  neologisms   particularly those of the
senseless type   2  the tendency to give unclassified reactions
largely of the  incoherent  type  and  3  the tendency toward
 stereotypy  manifested chiefly by abnormally frequent
repetitions of the same reaction  fairly characteristic also is the
occasional tendency to give sound reactions  again  occasionally one
encounters pronounced  perseveration   and at least two of our
subjects gave a good many unclassified reactions obviously due to
 distraction  

it must be noted that not infrequently cases of dementia pr√¶cox give
test records that cannot be distinguished from normal  it seems that
the pathological associational tendencies constitute merely a special
group of symptoms  some of which may be expected to be manifest in
cases which have reached a state of advanced mental deterioration  but
may not necessarily be present in the early stages of the disease  on
the other hand there is evidence to show that these tendencies may in
some cases appear among the earliest manifestations  this matter will
be referred to again 

thus the test records of dementia pr√¶cox depart from the normal not
sharply but by a gradual shading off  we find similar gradual
transitions between dementia pr√¶cox and other psychoses  for this
work we selected cases in which the diagnoses were established with
reasonable certainty  whether or not in cases of doubtful clinical
classification this association test may be of aid in determining the
diagnosis  is a question that must for the present remain open 

we submit herewith copies of test records  the numbers which appear
after the reactions indicate in each case the reaction type  in
accordance with table iii   p  27   common specific reactions are not
numbered

paranoic conditions 

the clinical group of psychoses included under the designation
paranoic conditions is far from being homogeneous  we have here cases
that are more or less closely allied to the paranoid form of dementia
pr√¶cox  other cases that are apparently dependent upon involutional
changes  kraepelin s  praeseniler beeintr√§chtigungswah    still
other cases that are characterized by absence or at least delay of
mental deterioration  etc 

in some of these cases disturbance of the flow of utterance is not
observed  and the test records obtained from them present no striking
abnormalities  distinctly pathological records are obtained mainly
from those cases which clinically resemble dementia pr√¶cox  in these
records the nature of the pathological reactions would seem to
indicate that the diagnosis of dementia pr√¶cox would be more
justifiable than that of paranoic condition 

the following test records will serve to illustrate the types of
reactions met with in this group of psychoses

epilepsy 

most of the cases of epilepsy in our collection show advanced dementia
and in some the clinical history would indicate also original mental
inferiority  that is to say  imbecility or feeble mindedness 

in these cases the dominant characteristic  so far as shown in the
test records  seems to be a narrowing of the mental horizon manifested
firstly by a tendency to repeat many times one or another word  and
secondly by an abnormally pronounced tendency to make use of
non specific reactions or particles of speech  occasionally other
abnormalities are noted  such as perseveration or distraction

general paresis 

cases presenting no considerable dementia or confusion and cases in a
state of remission are apt to give normal test records  as we proceed
from the records of such cases to those of cases showing mental
deterioration we observe a gradual reduction in the values of
reactions  contraction of the mental horizon  1  and the appearance of
the phenomenon of perseveration  we submit the following test records
for illustration 

 footnote 1  what we mean by contraction of the mental horizon has
already been described in connection with epilepsy  page 47

manic depressive insanity 

in this disorder the departures from the normal seem to be less
pronounced than in the psychoses considered above  the number of
individual reactions is in most cases not greatly above the normal
average  and  so far as their character is concerned  we find that
many of them are classed as normal  in accordance with the appendix to
the frequency tables  among the unclassified reactions  which are
quite frequent here  we find mostly either obviously normal ones  or
some of the type to which we have already referred as  far fetched  
while others among them are  circumstantial   see p  25   further we
find that most of the remaining individual reactions fall into the
general group of partial dissociation  non specific reactions  sound
reactions  word complements  and particles 

in some cases the only abnormality that is found is that of an undue
tendency to respond by non specific reactions  most of them being
common and there being no excessive number of individual reactions  it
would seem legitimate to assume that this tendency is here to be
regarded as a manifestation of the phenomenon which is clinically
described as  dearth of ideas   it is significant that this
tendency is observed not only in depressive phases of the psychosis 
but also in manic phases and even in the normal intervals of recurrent
cases or after apparent recovery in acute cases  this will be seen
from some of the test records which are here reproduced 

occasionally cases are met with which give a large number of
unclassified reactions  seemingly incoherent  there can be no doubt
that at least some of these cases are clinically perfectly typical
ones of manic depressive insanity  yet the test records strongly
resemble  in some respects  those of dementia pr√¶cox 

since clinically the distinction between typical cases of these
psychoses can be so clearly made on the basis of the disorders of the
flow of thought respectively characterizing them  it could hardly be
assumed that the associational disturbances in these two groups of
cases are truly related  although there may be an apparent
resemblance  it must be acknowledged that we are here confronted with
one of the most serious shortcomings of the association test  or at
least of the present method of applying it

involutional melancholia  alcoholic dementia  senile dementia 

there are so few cases of these psychoses in our series that we can
say but little concerning their associational disorders 

in table v  we show all the types of reactions given by each subject 

we have not observed in our cases of  involutional melancholia  any
undue tendency to give individual reactions  the records are either
perfectly normal or slightly abnormal in that they show an increase of
the non specific  common  reactions  in this respect they resemble
strongly the records obtained from some cases of manic depressive
insanity  this similarity is of interest in connection with other
evidence  recently brought to light   1  showing that involutional
melancholia is closely related to manic depressive insanity  if not
identical with it

 8  pathological reactions from normal subjects 

mental disorders do not always so manifest themselves as to
incapacitate the subject for his work or to necessitate his
sequestration in a hospital for the insane  it is  therefore  not
surprising that in applying the association test to over a thousand
subjects selected at random we have obtained a small number of test
records which show various types of abnormal reactions  among the
subjects who furnished such records some are described as eccentric 
taciturn  or dull  while others are apparently normal but come of
neuropathic stock  a few of them are persons wholly unknown to us 

we reproduce in full from the normal series  containing abnormal
reactions

  9  number of different words given as reactions 


it has been suggested by fuhrmann  1  that the number of different
words given in response to one hundred selected stimulus words may be
used as  a fairly reliable measure of the intelligence and degree of
education of a patient   the test according to fuhrmann is applied
twice in every case  the interval between the two sittings being at
least four weeks   in very intelligent and well educated persons every
100 stimulus words almost always evokes in the first test 95 100
different associations  in the less intelligent and in the
feeble minded the same associations are more frequently repeated  in
the second test with the same stimulus words  which is really much
more important than the first  since even persons or inferior
intelligence may reach higher numbers in the first test  the
difference in the wealth of the stock of representations becomes
plainly evident  the man of intelligence will not need to draw on the
associations which he gave in the first test  but will produce new
ones  the feeble minded subject will  on the contrary  repeat to a
greater or lesser extent the associations of the first test    in
general the associational capacity of an adult person may be taken to
be from 80 per cent to 90 per cent  should the number sink below 70
per cent the suspicion of a pathological condition must then arise 
and the higher the subject s degree of education the stronger is this
suspicion  in the case of an associational capacity of 60 per cent or
less no doubt of its pathological significance can remain any longer

our results are not strictly comparable with fuhrmann s  because we
have obtained but one test record from each subject  it may be said 
however  that the results of a single test in each case do not show
any considerable differences  corresponding to education or age  in
the variety of responses  further  dementing psychoses  with the
exception of epilepsy  show on the whole no diminution in the number
of different reactions  although in individual cases this number falls
considerably below the general average  and in such cases the
diminution may be dependent upon stereotypy or perseveration  and not
necessarily upon reduction in the stock of representations 

it would appear from our results that pathological mental states are
apt to manifest themselves by a tendency to give reactions belonging
to types of inferior values rather than by diminished variety of
responses 

we show in table vi  the numbers of different responses given by our
groups of normal and insane subjects  expressed in figures giving for
each group the median and the average

  10  co operation of the subject 


in our work with insane subjects we encountered many cases in which we
were unable to obtain satisfactory test records owing to lack of
proper co operation  some subjects seemed to be either too confused or
too demented to be capable of understanding and following the
instructions given them  others were for one reason or another
unwilling to co operate  it is important to distinguish inability from
unwillingness to co operate  since the former indicates in itself an
abnormal state of the mind  while the latter is quite often shown by
normal persons 

a subject may co operate to the extent of giving a single word in
response to each stimulus word  and yet fail to co operate in some
other particulars 

he may  instead of giving the first word suggested to him by the
stimulus  suppress the first word more or less systematically  and
give some other word which may seem to him more appropriate  this
probably occurs very often  but does not seem to render the results
less serviceable for our purpose 

further  a subject may react by words related not to the stimulus
words  but to each other  thus simulating perseveration  or he may
react by naming objects within reach of the senses  thus appearing to
be distracted  or he may give only sound reactions 

there is  in fact  no type of pathological reactions which a normal
person may not be able to produce more or less readily at will  though
in the case of incoherent reactions considerable mental effort may be
required  and the end may be attained only by regularly rejecting the
first and some subsequent words which are suggested by the stimulus 

in view of these considerations we are led to conclude that the
association test  as applied by our method  could not be relied upon
as a means of detecting simulation of insanity in malingerers 
criminals  and the like 



  11  summary 


the normal range of reaction in response to any of our stimulus words
is largely confined within narrow limits 

the frequency tables compiled from test records given by one
thousand normal subjects comprise over ninety per cent of the
normal range in the average case 

with the aid of the frequency tables and the appendix normal
reactions  with a very few exceptions  can be sharply distinguished
from pathological ones 

the separation of pathological reactions from normal ones simplifies
the task of their analysis  and makes possible the application of a
classification based on objective criteria 

by the application of the association test  according to the method
here proposed  no sharp distinction can be drawn between mental health
and mental disease  a large collection of material shows a gradual and
not an abrupt transition from the normal state to pathological states 

in dementia pr√¶cox  some paranoic conditions  manic depressive
insanity  general paresis  and epileptic dementia the test reveals
some characteristic  though not pathognomonic  associational
tendencies 



acknowledgments 


it is with pleasure that we acknowledge our indebtedness to the many
persons who have assisted us in collecting the data for this work

following persons  dr  frederic lyman wells  dr  jennie a  dean  miss
lillian rosanoff  and miss madeleine wehle 

dr  o  m  dewing  the late superintendent of the long island state
hospital  and dr  chas  w  pilgrim  superintendent of the hudson river
state hospital  have assisted the work by kindly permitting the test
to be made upon employees of these institutions  and we are especially
indebted to dr  f  w  parsons for personal assistance in securing the
co operation of many subjects 

professor r  s  woodworth  of columbia university  extended to us the
courtesy of the psychological laboratory during several weeks of the
summer session of 1909  and gave us much assistance in obtaining
interviews with students  we received assistance also from several of
the instructors of teachers  college  especially mr  wm  h  noyes 

we are indebted to mr  f c  lewis and mr  w e  stark  of the ethical
culture school  new york  for permitting us to make the test upon the
pupils of that school 

in the work of compiling the tables we have been assisted by dr  n 
w  bartram  dr  jennie a  dean  mrs  h  m  kent  and others 

we wish  finally  to express our thanks to dr  wm  austin macy 
superintendent of this hospital  to whom we are indebted for the
