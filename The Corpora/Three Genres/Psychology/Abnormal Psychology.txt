hysteria as a weapon in marital conflicts

the progress in our understanding of hysteria has come largely through the
elaboration of the so called mechanisms by which the symptoms arise   these
mechanisms have been declared to reside or to have their origin in the
subconsciousness or coconsciousness  the mechanisms range all the way from
the conception of janet that the personality is disintegrated owing to
lowering of the psychical tension to that of freud  who conceives all
hysterical symptoms as a result of dissociation arising through conflicts
between repressed sexual desires and experiences and the various censors
organized by the social life  without in any way intending to set up any
other general mechanism or to enter into the controversy raging concerning
the freudian mechanism  which at present is the storm center  the writer
reports a case in which the origin of the symptoms can be traced to a more
simple and fairly familiar mechanism  one which  in its essence  is merely
an intensification of a normal reaction of many women to marital
difficulties  in other words  women frequently resort to measures which
bring about an acute discomfort upon the part of their mate  through his
pity  compassion and self accusation  they resort to tears as their
proverbial weapon for gaining their point  in this case the hysterical
symptoms seem to have been the substitute for tears in a domestic battle 

case history  patient is a woman  aged thirty eight  of american birth and
ancestry   family history is negative so far as mental disease is concerned 
but there seems to have been a decadence of stock as manifested in the
steady dropping of her family in the social scale  she is one of two
children  there being a brother  who  from all accounts  is a fairly
industrious  but poverty stricken farmer   her early childhood was spent in
a small village in massachusetts   she received but little education 
largely because she had no desire to study and no aptitude for learning 
although she is by no means feeble minded  the menstrual periods started at
fourteen  and have been without any noteworthy accompanying phenomena ever
since   history is negative so far as other diseases are concerned  she
worked as a domestic and in factories until she was married for the first
time at the age of twenty   she had no children by this marriage  it is
stated on good authority that she took preventive measures against
conception and if pregnant induced abortion by drugs and mechanical
measures  at the end of eight years there was a divorce   just which one of
the partners was at fault is impossible to state  but that there was more
than mere incompatibility is evident by the reticence of all concerned 
shortly afterward  she married her present husband with whom she has lived
for about nine years   he is a steady drinker  but is a good workman  has
never been discharged  and  apparently  his drinking habits do not interfere
with the main tenor of his life   he lives with the patient in a small house
of which they occupy two garret rooms  meagerly furnished  though without
evidence of dire poverty 

from her fifteenth year the patient has been subject to fainting spells   by
all accounts they come on usually after quarrels  disagreements or
disappointments   they are not accompanied by blanching  by clonic or tonic
movements of any kind  they last for uncertain periods ranging from five
minutes to an hour or more  and consciousness does not seem to be totally
lost  in addition she has vomiting spells  these likewise occurring when
balked in her desires   she is subject to headaches  usually on one half of
the head  but frequently frontal  there is no regular period of occurrence
of these headaches except that there is also some relation to quarrels  etc 
on several occasions the patient has lost her voice for short periods
ranging from a few minutes to several hours following particularly stormy
domestic scenes 

on july 29 of this year she was suddenly paralyzed  that is to say  she was
unable to move the right arm  the right leg  the right side of the face  and
she lost the power of speech entirely  there was complete aphonia   this
 stroke  was not accompanied by unconsciousness  but was preceded by severe
headache and much nausea   during the three weeks that followed she remained
in bed  recovering only the function of the arm  her husband fed her by
forcing open her mouth with a spoon  she did not lose control of the
sphincters   as she manifested no other progress to recovery despite the
administration of drugs  numerous rubbings and liniments  the physician in
charge called the writer into consultation 

physical examination aug  20  a well developed  fairly well nourished woman 
appearing to be about thirty five years of age  face wears an anxious
expression and she shuns the examiner s direct gaze  movements of the right
hand and arm are now fairly free  there is no appreciable difficulty in any
of its functions according to tests made for ataxia  strength  recognition
of form  finer movements  etc   in fact  she uses this hand to write with 
as she cannot talk at all   such writing is free  unaccompanied by errors in
spelling  there is no elision of syllables and no difficulty in finding the
words desired   the face is symmetrical on the two sides  there is no
evidence of paralysis of the facial muscles  in fact  the cranial nerves  by
detailed examination  are intact  except in so far as respiration and speech
are concerned  the right leg is held entirely spastic  the muscles on both
sides of the joints  that is  flexors and extensors  being equally
contracted  it is impossible to bend this leg at any joint except by the use
of very great force   the reflexes everywhere are lively but are equal on
the two sides  and none of the abnormal reflexes is present  including in
this term babinski  gordon and oppenheim 

sensation  there is very markedly diminished reaction to pin prick all over
the right side  including face  arm  chest  leg and tongue  in some places
complete analgesia obtains   reaction to touch is likewise diminished and
recognition of heat and cold is impaired 

speech  there is complete loss of the ability to make any sound  either
voiced or whispered  that is to say  there is complete aphonia    there is
loss of all voice   the patient understands everything  however  and writes
her answers to questions rapidly and correctly  she can read whatever is
written  there is no difficulty in the recognition of objects  no evidence
of any aphasia whatever 

the diagnosis  hysteria  can hardly be doubted   the history of headaches 
fainting spells without marked impairment of consciousness  vomiting spells 
hemianaesthesia  hemianalgesia  complete aphonia and an exaggerated
paralysis  not only of the right leg  but of the ability to thrust out the
tongue  while at the same time all other cranial functions were unimpaired
together with the apparent health of the individual in every other respect 
make up a syndrome hardly to pass unrecognized 

treatment  the patient was entirely inaccessible to direct suggestion  for
no amount of assurance that her leg was all right enabled her to move it 
when such suggestions were made  she shook her head firmly and conclusively 
and this is true of suggestions concerning speech  this point is of
importance in the consideration of the mechanism  attempts at hypnotism
failed ingloriously   psychoanalysis was deferred for the time  and recourse
was had to indirect suggestion and re education 

the first function to be restored was the power of bending the leg which
hitherto had been held entirely spastic   the patient was assured that while
she had lost the power of using the limb  a little relaxation of the muscles
of the front of the leg would permit it to be bent  her attention was
distracted while at the same time a firm  steady pressure was put upon the
leg above and below the knee joint and advantage taken of every change in
the tone of the muscles involved in keeping the leg extended   little by
little the leg was bent until finally it was completely flexed  this for the
first time in three weeks  her attention was called to this fact and she was
assured that upon the physician s next attempt to bend her leg  resistance
would be lessened and she would be able to aid somewhat as well   this
proved true  then the leg was only partly supported by the physician while
the patient was assured that with his help she would be able to bend it more
freely  from this  she passed on to the ability to move the leg without any
assistance on the part of the writer   after having been given exercise in
bending the leg for some twenty or thirty times  with complete restoration
of this ability  she was induced to get out of bed  and while standing erect
she was suddenly released by the physician  she swayed to and fro in a
rather perilous manner but did not fall  finally  by gradation of tasks set 
by a judicious combination of encouragement and command  she was enabled to
walk   she was then put to bed and assured that upon the physician s next
visit she would be taught to walk freely   meanwhile  the husband was
instructed that he must not allow her to stay in bed more than an hour at a
time and that she must come to the table for her meals 

on the physician s next visit  two days later  it was found that the husband
had not been able to induce his wife to come to the table  and that he had
been unable to get her to walk   the physician then commanded her to get out
of bed  which she did with great effort  she was then put back to bed and
instructed to get up more freely and without such effort  demonstration
being a visual one  in that she was shown how best to accomplish the task
set  finally  at the end of the visit  she was walking quite freely and
promised in writing  for she had not as yet learned to talk  that she would
eat at the table 

the next day instruction was commenced along the lines of speech  upon being
asked to thrust out her tongue  that organ was protruded only a short
distance  and she claimed  in writing  to be unable to protrude it further 
thereupon it was taken hold of by a towel and alternately withdrawn from and
replaced into the mouth   after a short period of such exercise she was
enabled to thrust the tongue in and out  she was then instructed to breathe
more freely  that is to say  to take short inspirations and to make long
expirations  this in preparation for speech  she was unable to do this  the
expiration being short  jerky and interrupted  thereupon the examiner placed
his two hands  one on each side of her chest  instructed her to inspire  and
when she was instructed to expire forced his hands against her ribs in order
to complete the expiratory act  after about fifteen or twenty minutes of
this combination of instruction and help the patient was able to breathe by
herself and freely  she was then instructed to make the sound  e  at the end
of expiration  this she was unable to do at first  but upon persistence and
passive placing of her mouth in the proper position for the sound  she was
able to whisper  e    from this she rapidly went on to the other vowel
sounds  then the aspirate  h  was added  later the explosives   p   etc  
until at the end of about two hours she was enabled to whisper anything
desired  her husband was instructed not to allow her to use her pencil any
more  and she promised faithfully to enter into whispered conversation with
him  although it was evident that she promised this with reluctance 

upon the next visit  two days later  she was still whispering  and when
asked if she could talk aloud  shook her head and whispered  no   that she
was sure she could not  efforts to have her make the sound  a   or any of
the vowels in a voiced manner failed completely   she was then instructed to
cough  although it is evident that a cough is a voiced sound  she was able
to do this  in a very low and indistinct manner  she was then instructed to
add the sound  e  at the end of her cough  this she did  but with
difficulty   finally  after much the same manoeuvering which has been
indicated in the account of how she was instructed to whisper  she talked
freely and well  when this was accomplished the husband was instructed to
have her dress herself and to take her to   some place of amusement  and to
keep her out of doors almost continuously 

at all times the patient had complained of a pain in her side which she
claimed was the root of all her trouble  it had been  doctored   to use her
term  by all the physicians in the city and  it was alleged  came after she
had been lifting a paralyzed old lady in the house across the way  despite
all treatment this pain had not disappeared and the various diagnoses
made  strain  liver trouble  nervous ache had not sufficed to console the
patient or to relieve her   there was no local tenderness  no pain upon
movement  but merely a steady ache  no physical basis whatever for this
trouble could be found  her medicine for the relief of it was discontinued 
and so  too  were certain medicines she had been obtaining for sleep 

upon each visit the husband and wife had been informed by the physician that
he did not believe the trouble was organic in its nature  that he believed
it depended upon some ideas that the patient had  and that  furthermore  it
was the result of some mental irritation  compared for the purpose of fixing
the point to a festering sore and which  if removed  would permanently
eliminate the liability of such seizures   the patient and her husband were
informed that the physician intended to delve to the bottom of this trouble
and  by deferring investigation as to its exact nature until the symptoms
had practically disappeared  a way was cleared to obtain their complete
confidence  and at the same time to overcome any unwillingness to accept a
psychical explanation for such palpable physical ills  this latter point is
of importance in dealing with uneducated persons  for the most part  they
are intensely practical and materialistic  and a mere idea does not seem to
them to account for paralysis although  of course  such skepticism is
usually accompanied by superstitious credulity along other lines   moreover 
by establishing himself as a sort of miracle worker  for so the cure was
regarded   it would be understood that curiosity was not the basis for the
investigation into the domestic life of the patient and her husband  but
that a desire to do more good inspired it 

the physician started his investigation with the statement that he knew from
past experience that some conflict was going on between husband and wife 
that there was some source of irritation which caused these outbursts of
symptoms on the part of the patient  and that unless they told him what was
behind the matter his help would be limited to the relief of the present
symptoms  it was firmly stated that any denial of such discord would not be
believed  and that only a complete confidence would be helpful 

the patient  who had been listening to this statement with lowered eyes and
nervously intertwining fingers  then burst out as follows  there was trouble
between them and there always would be until it was settled right   this
with much emphasis and emotional manifestation  so long as he insisted on
living where they did  just so long would she quarrel with him   she did not
like the neighbors  especially the woman downstairs  she did not like the
room  she did not like anything about the place or the neighborhood  hated
the very sight of it and would never cease attempting to move from there  it
came out on further questioning that the woman downstairs  whom the patient
particularly disliked  was a storm center in that the wife was jealous of
her  although she adduced no very good reasons for her attitude   moreover 
the patient stated that she wished to move to a district where she had
friends  though other sources of information showed that these friends were
of a rather unsavory character  her husband was absolutely determined not to
move from his house  he stated that he would rather have her go away and
stay away than move from there  that the rent was too high in the place
where she wanted to move  and that the rent was suitable where they were 
moreover  for his part  he hated his wife s desired neighborhood and would
never consent to changing his residence from the present place to the other 
it came out that her fainting and vomiting spells and headaches usually
followed bitter quarrels  and on other matters these symptoms usually placed
the victory on her side  on this particular point  however  her husband had
remained obdurate  it was shown that the present attack of paralysis and
aphonia  symptoms of an unusually severe character  followed an unusually
bitter quarrel which had lasted for a whole day and into the night of the
attack 

the question arises at this point   why did this attack take the form of a
paralysis    at first this seemed unaccountable  but later it was found that
the old woman for whom the patient had been caring had a  stroke  with loss
of the power to speak  though no aphonia  the patient had gone to work as a
sort of nurse for the old woman under protest  for she did not wish to do
anything outside of her own light housekeeping  although the added income
was sorely needed since work was slack in her husband s place of employment 
the pain in her side caused her to quit work as nurse  much to her husband s
dissatisfaction until she convinced him that her pain and disability were
marked  it was evident that despite the controversies and quarrels that
prevailed in the household  her husband sincerely loved her  for he stayed
away from his work during the three weeks of her illness to act as her
nurse  moreover  he spent his earnings quite freely in consulting various
physicians in order to cure her 

it was shown from what both the patient and her husband said  and from the
whole history of their marital life  that she had used as a weapon  though
not with definite conscious purpose  for the gaining of her point in
whatever quarrel came up  symptoms that are usually called hysterical  that
is to say  vomiting  fainting spells and pains without definite physical
cause  this method usually assured her victory by playing upon her husband s
alarm and concern as well as by causing him intense dissatisfaction  with
the advent of a disagreement which could not be settled her way by her usual
symptoms  there followed  not by any means through her volition or conscious
purpose  more severe symptoms  namely  spastic paralysis and aphonia  which 
in a general way  were suggested by her patient  there seems to have been 
and there undoubtedly was  a sexual element entering into this last quarrel 
namely  that she was jealous of the woman who lived downstairs  though
without any proof of her husband s infidelity 

both patient and her husband finally agreed to the physician s statement
that the symptoms were directly referable to the quarrels  although both
claimed that it had never occurred to them before  a fact made evident by
their questions and objections  no psychoanalysis was possible in this case 
for the man and woman belong to that class of people who feel that they are
cured when their symptoms are relieved   it may be argued  without any
possibility of contradiction  that a psychoanalysis would have revealed a
deeper reaching mechanism and that a closer relationship and connection
between the paralysis and other symptoms with the past sexual experiences of
the patient could have been established  this last claim may be doubted 
however  for there is always a gap between the alleged  conversion  of
mental states into physical symptoms  and this gap can in no case be bridged
over even by freud s own accounts  the conversion always remains as a mere
statement and is a logical connection between the appearance of physical
symptoms and the so called conflicts  in other words  it is an explanation
and not a fact   compared with the complex freudian mechanism  with its
repressions  compressions  censors  dreams  etc   the conception of
hysterical symptoms as a marital weapon as comparable with the tears of more
normal women seems very simple and probably too simple  in fact  it does not
explain the hysteria  it merely gives a use for its symptoms  and the writer
is driven back to the statement that the neuropathic person is characterized
by his or her bizarre and prolonged emotional reactions  which  in turn 
brings us back to a defect ab origine   and the freudians  starting out to
prove that the experiences of the individual alone cause hysteria  by
pushing back the time of those experiences to infancy  and lately to foetal
life   have proved the contrary  that is  the inborn nature of the disease 



the analysis of a nightmare

by raymond bellamy

professor of education  emory and henry college  emory  va 

a few nights ago i experienced a very interesting nightmare  and 
immediately on awakening  i got up and recorded it  analyzing it as fully as
i was able   this is the first nightmare i have had for several years  and i
never was especially addicted to them  two years ago i made an introductory
study of dreams  1  and at that time dreamed profusely  but recently i have
been dreaming very rarely  and when i do dream the experiences are not at
all vivid  i use the term  nightmare  in a somewhat popular sense to mean a
painful or frightful dream accompanied by physical disturbances  such as
heart flutter and disturbances of breathing  and followed on awakening by a
certain amount of the painful emotion which was a part of the dream 
accepting this definition  the experience which i have to relate was a
typical nightmare   a few words of explanation are necessary to give the
proper setting for the experience  at present i am teaching in the summer
school at this place and my wife is visiting her folks  during her absence 
in order to keep from getting too lonesome  i invited one of the young men
in the summer school to come and room with me and keep me company  with this
as an explanation  i shall copy the original account of the dream as nearly
as possible  making a few corrections of the barbarous language i used in
the half asleep state 

 1  at clark university  1912 1913 

on the night of august 9  1914  i went to bed at 11 40 o clock and was soon
asleep   about 3 40 in the morning  the young man  f  k  s   roused me and i
awoke weak  scared  and with a fluttering heart  he said i had been making a
distressing sort of noise  but he could not distinguish any words 
immediately  i judged that the dream was caused by my lying on my back  and
in an uncomfortable position  as a rule i do not sleep on my back  but for
some reason i had gone to sleep that way this time   also  it had been
raining when i went to bed  and i had put the windows down  and the
ventilation was bad 

the dream  as nearly as it was remembered  was as follows  i was with
somebody in a buggy and we drove down a hill  across a little stream  and up
the other hill  where we arrived at our destination  i seemed to find
trouble in getting a place to hitch  and i had to take the horse out of the
buggy and i think take the harness off  i distinctly remember that in the
dream this was a hardship to me  as it would have been in waking life  for i
am not a good hand with horses  and do not like to work with them  all this
is very hazy to me  and i do not know with whom i was driving  but think it
was a lady  possibly my wife  there were other people at this place and
other horses and buggies   could it be called a case of reversion to
childhood  in that there were only horses and buggies and no automobiles  
there is a break in the dream here  and we were within some kind of a
building where there was a crowd of people   as it seems now  we were around
some kind of a rotunda  but this is very vague  the important part seems to
be that there were two people  a man and a woman  who were talking very
stealthily and earnestly to each other  and they soon drew me into the
conversation  it runs in my head now that the man was my father  who has
been dead for some years   though i am not sure about this  while there is
no recollection of who the woman was  now it appeared that there was some
woman in the crowd who had some peculiar evil influence over every one and
whom everybody feared  this man and woman were planning to slip off from
this wicked woman and meet me and the one with me on the road  and in some
way  which is not now clear  we were to circumvent this bad woman and break
her power   the man explained and explained to me that we were to meet at
certain springs which were at the side of the road  but it seemed that i
could not get it into my head where they were  and i was afraid i would not
stop at the right place  at last i thought i knew where he meant  and told
him that i would stop there and wait until he came up  but then i happened
to think that he might be ahead of me anyhow  and could stop and wait for
me  then i was sure he would be ahead  for i remembered that i had to
harness and hitch up the horse and his was all ready  and now we seemed to
be getting our horses  and i remarked to him that i was not a bit good hand
at working with horses  and he expressed his sympathy that i had this work
to do 

here was a second break in the dream  and i was standing in a hallway 
looking through a window into a room   in this room sat my wife and the evil
woman whom everybody feared   she had learned our play  i was conscious of
this in the dream   and was determined to have her revenge  and prevent us
carrying out our plan   she had hypnotized my wife  and had her scared so
that she was in great mental agony  i heard her saying   now you are a big
black cat   or something much like this  at any rate making her think she
was a cat and at the same time leaving her partly conscious of who she was 
this woman looked exactly like a woman who lives in the neighborhood where
my wife is now visiting and of whom she has always been somewhat afraid
because of her sharp tongue and unpleasant ways   immediately  i was filled
with a great fear for my wife and with a raging anger against the woman  i
broke out into calling her all kinds of names  especially saying   you
devil  you devil   and trying to get through the window to her  i tore out
the screen  but had a great deal of difficulty in doing so  when i had
finally succeeded in tearing the screen out  i threw it at her head  but she
did not dodge  but sat boldly upright and seemed to defy me   then i tried
to jump through the window to get to her  but was so weak that i could not
do so  this seems strange since the window was not more than three feet from
the floor   i was making unsuccessful attempts to get through  and was
railing at the woman when s  awoke me  i awoke weak  and for some time
continued to feel frightened  though not enough so to keep me from talking
and writing out the dream  i got up and put up the windows  since the rain
had stopped   and about this time a very fair explanation of parts of the
dream came to me  i immediately told it to s   in order to keep from
forgetting it  and then decided to write it down  which i proceeded to do 

parts of the dream seem to analyze very nicely  but there are parts which
seem to resist analysis  i did not try to force the analysis but gave only
the part which came spontaneously  in the first part of the dream i was
driving in a buggy  i crossed a creek and had trouble with unharnessing a
horse  several times recently  i have mentioned the fact that i never liked
to work with horses  even when on the farm at home  i do not remember of
having mentioned this fact on the day of the dream  but mr  c  had stopped
in to call on me that evening and had mentioned that he drove in in a buggy 
i had not seen the buggy and had wondered what he did with it  and had not
remembered to ask him   he had also told me that he was going to a place
called yellow springs  i knew about where yellow springs are  but could not
quite place them and had tried to figure out what direction he would go 
this seemed to come out very clearly in the dream  when i was trying to find
out where these unknown springs by the side of the road were   i had related
during the evening how i recently fell into a creek with my clothes on and
this probably accounted for the creek over which i drove in the dream  in
the dim second part of the dream  the rotunda seems to have resembled the
chapel of the new college building which is being builded  and about which i
was talking that afternoon 

the last part of the dream seems to have been the important part  and in it
several of the freudian mechanisms show up very plainly  just before going
to bed  i had read an article about vera cheberiak  the russian murderess of
the mendel beilis case  and how she is now engaged in suing different people
for slander  the article had described her as coolly and impudently sitting
up in court and seeming to realize her power over her enemies  and it had
also made a point of the great fear in which she is held  i had read another
article about the city of salem  which has recently burned  and i had
remembered that it was the  witch  town of colonial days where people were
supposed to be turned into black cats  i had read still another article 
descriptive of country life  which described how a man had climbed a tree
after a cat which was eating young robins   i had just a day or two before
received a letter from my wife  which contained the news that she was going
to visit this woman whom she fears  but whom she must visit because of their
social relation as already mentioned  the woman in the dream looked just
like this one  and it will readily be recognized that the dream woman was a
condensation of vera cheberiak  a salem  witch   and the woman whom my wife
fears  the fact that she was hypnotized into thinking she was a cat would
naturally accompany the salem witch  and the cat in the apple tree 
concerning which i had read  might also have entered the dream  aside from
these  there is another element which may have been instrumental in causing
my wife to be punished by thinking she was a cat  i once saw a woman who was
suffering from melancholia who thought she was a cat  and her mental
suffering seemed to me to be about the keenest of any that i have ever
observed  this possibly caused the dream making factor to represent her as
thinking she was a cat  the hall  window and screen are also easy of
explanation  that evening i had examined a window which opens from our
bedroom into a hall  and had wondered whether we would continue to keep it
curtained this year or take the curtains away  when i put down the windows
to keep out the driving rain  i had had trouble with a screen much as i did
in the dream 

the heart of the dream seems to be in this last scene  that morning  it was
sunday  i had very unwillingly  and from a sense of duty  gone to a tiresome
and long drawn out church service   i had become so fatigued during the
service  and so disagreed with some of the things the preacher said  that i
was conscious of a mild desire to swear and throw something  i had
humorously mentioned this fact after the service  but there was quite an
element of truth in the jest  the dream gave me the chance of my life to
fulfil this desire  and i seized the opportunity by breaking into a stream
of profanity  not very successful profanity  i fear  as i never use it when
awake and therefore was not in good practice  and throwing the screen at the
woman   but was there not a deeper meaning than this in the dream   i think
so decidedly  it seems that it would be a lot of trouble to construct such a
tremendous nightmare just to give me an opportunity to swear and throw
something  because a preacher had been somewhat tiresome   there was
evidently a deeper and more subtle wish which was also fulfilled  that
evening i had walked up the railroad track with a crowd of young people and
where the paths crossed we had all split up and gone different directions 
two young ladies had gone back to their boarding places across the campus 
and i had suggested to the young fellow with me that we go along with them 
however  he objected  and we walked back down the railroad track  now  it
had occurred to me that he probably thought i was not within my bounds as a
married man when i wanted to walk back with these young ladies  something of
the same idea had come to me that day when some one had said in a
conversation   professor b  is the most satisfied man on the campus whose
wife is away   i had wondered if they thought i did not care for my wife and
vaguely wished i had some way of showing my love for her  and  more than
that  these suggestions had very naturally made me wonder if i really care
for her as much as i should  i could not have asked for a better opportunity
to serve and show my love for my wife than the dream gave me  and at the
same time it assured me of my affection for her  there is still another
element of repression in this and that is that i have for some time been
wanting to forcibly express myself against the unpleasant ways of this lady
whom my wife so fears  in the dream  i very freely and fully followed this
desire 

this far i can go in the analysis and feel sure of my ground  it will be
noticed that i have not resorted to symbolism  and have made very little
technical use even of the freudian mechanisms  i could very easily plunge
into symbolism and more elaborate analysis  but should i do so i fear i
would be in the same condition as a bright young scholar who made an
elaborate study of freudian theories  he expressed himself by saying that it
was a  chaotic inferno   this analysis will seem very unfinished to many of
the well trained readers of the journal  and so  in a way  it does to me 
but it may be interesting as the work of a layman rather than a trained
physician  i have not used the word  sexual  in this paper  but the reader
can judge for himself if the impulses would come under this heading  either
in the more narrow use of the term or in the broader meaning which freud has
given it   for myself  i see no possible objection in employing the word
 sexual  in this connection 

the uncertain parts of the dream are as interesting in a way as the others 
why did i not know with whom i was riding  and why were the persons with
whom i talked more certain in their identity  here  of course  is the place
where it would be easy to find a repression if such existed and  i
believe  if it did not exist  whether there is such a repression there or
not i do not know  but i see no necessity for considering that there is one
there just because there is a dim place in the dream   in the study which i
made of dreams a year or so ago  i became convinced that there is a
principle of dream making which has not been noticed  i will throw out a
suggestion here in the hope that some one will study it further  but will
give no elaborate discussion in this paper   briefly  it is that only those
things appear in a dream which are necessary to express the meaning of the
dream  a few illustrations may make this clear   every one has noticed the
rarity with which colors and sunshine appear in dreams  i have found 
however  that colors and sunshine always appear if there is any necessity
for their doing so   some one dreams of a melon and looks to see if it is
ripe  he sees the red color  he dreams of a stream which he thinks is a
sewer and smells it to see if it gives off an odor and finds that it does 
he dreams of pulling his fishing line to see if there is a fish on it and
senses the pull of the fish  i have examples in abundance which go to
indicate that taste  smell  tactual  kinaesthetic  color sensation or any
other kind will appear in a dream when they are called for to complete the
meaning of the dream  but they are not common because they are very rarely
needed  even in waking life we rarely think in these terms  if this little
principle prove true  it would be easy to understand why certain parts of a
dream are dim without going to the doubtful process of positing a
repression  the persons in the dream were not recognized simply because
there was no need for them to be  the dream expressed the pertinent meaning
just as well without them as with them  they were observed just as many of
us would observe the occupants of a street car in waking life  we could
possibly not describe  even partly  any one of the occupants of the car
which we used on our way to the office or home 

before leaving this nightmare  i want to call attention again to the somatic
elements   i was lying on my back and in a cramped position  the air was
closer than usual  and my circulation was naturally deranged  when i awoke i
was strongly inclined to give the physical elements a large amount of the
responsibility for the dream  and i have not found occasion to change my
mind in this matter  i think that even the inability to jump through the
window in the dream was caused by the weak and exhausted state of my body 
due to the poor circulation and cramped position 



analysis of a single dream as a means of unearthing the genesis of
psychopathic affections

by meyer solomon  md   chicago

those  of us who have devoted a certain amount of our time and energy to the
study of dreams have early come to realize the value of a dream as a
starting point in the analysis of certain mental states  particularly those
of an abnormal character 

frequently  in the hopeless tangle of symptoms  complaints and disconnected
facts in the history as originally obtained  especially in old standing
cases  one does not really know just where to begin  what to start with in
the first efforts to struggle with the problem of the ultimate genesis and
evolution of the condition which is presented to him at the particular
moment  of course  by a careful review of the patient s past life history 
gone over by persistent questioning and cross examination  one can begin
with the family history and step by step trace the history of the patient
from earliest childhood or infancy through the various stages and phases of
activity and development up to the very moment of examination   this may at
times appear quite dull  quite uninteresting and entirely unnecessary to
certain patients  for this reason and also for many other reasons  which i
shall not enumerate at this point it is at times well to resort to dream
analysis  and in analyzing dreams it is well to remember a fact  with which
i believe all psychoanalysts will agree  namely  that by a most thorough and
far reaching analysis of a single dream  we can  by following out to the
ultimate ends the various clues which are given us and the various by paths
which offer themselves to us in the course of the analysis  we can  i
repeat  should we be so inclined  root up the entire life history of the
dreamer  this may not be necessary in all cases   but  at any rate  if we
desired so to do for scientific purposes  we could arrive at such results 
in such an analysis we would  of course  first take up  individually  every
portion and every element of every portion of the dream  and by means of
each such lesser or greater element of the dream  we could arrive at a mass
of material  a wealth of information concerning the past experiential 
emotional  mental and moral life of the individual whose dream we were at
the moment analyzing  in fact  one could ferret out the full life history in
great detail  thus obtaining a complete autobiography leading far down into
the depths of the dreamer s mental life and into the inner world of his own 
with the material so obtained one could truly reconstruct the complete life
history  piecemeal  until the wonderful and inspiring structure of the
mental world of the dreamer would be reared  reaching far back to early
childhood and perhaps even to infancy  extending so far forward as to give
us a prophecy  based on the dreamer s dynamic trends and emotional trends
and leanings  of the probable future  stretching forth its tentacles in all
directions  and  uncovering the psychic underworld in its every part 
holding up before our eyes the naked mind  in its length  its breadth and
its thickness 

i am not referring here particularly to the employment of the method of
hypnosis  especially as practiced by prince  or to freud s so called free
association  which is frequently really forced association  or jung s word
association methods  i am speaking only of analysis of the dream by ordinary
conversation and introspection  in the normal waking state  of course  were
the latter method supplemented by these other methods  the results would be
so much the more complete and far reaching  i may mention  specifically 
that the employment of freud s free association method would be helpful here
in gathering information because  when employing this method  one
practically forces the one being analyzed to think by analogy and by
comparison  insisting that he tell you what a certain word or name or scene
or experience or what not reminds him of  what it resembles  what he can
compare it to  no matter how remote its connection  no matter how unrelated 
how far fetched or how silly the association may appear in his own eyes  in
other words  we demand that he co operate by suspending critical selection
and judgment  although  as i say  freud s  jung s  prince s and other
methods may be advantageously employed  still  it seems to me  although i
cannot yet state this in final or positive terms  that  at least in most
cases  such an unravelment and resurrection of the past life history can be
obtained by an analysis of the dream conducted in the ordinary  waking
state  and the usual conversational mode of history taking and daily oral
intercourse 

it needs no repetition or elaboration to convince psychoanalysts  i use the
term  psychoanalyst  in the broad  unrestricted sense of the word  including
the supporters of all possible schools or standpoints or methods in
psychoanalysis or mental analysis  and not limiting it to freud s
psychoanalysis  of the essential and fundamental truth of this statement  i
shall  therefore  not unnecessarily lengthen this paper by endeavoring to
bring forth complete evidence of the truth of this assertion 

as a matter of fact  this conclusion or generalization applies not alone to
dreams but to any single element in the objective or subjective world which
may be seized upon as the initial stimulus and from which  as a
starting point  association of ideas  in ordinary conversation or aided by
any of the more or less experimental or artificial but valuable methods
heretofore mentioned  may be begun and continued ad libitum or even ad
infinitum  under the tactful guidance and judgment of the investigator   for
example  if i may be permitted to tread upon the dangerous path of
near sensationalism or extremism  i may mention that were i to take even so
common  so widely used  and so relatively insignificant a word as the
definite article  the  as the initial stimulus  and have one of my fellowmen
or fellow women  whose full co operation  it is assumed  i have previously
obtained  give me one or more free or random word associations  and
thereafter  with these newly acquired elements  continued to forge my way
into the thickly wooded and unexplored recesses of the unknown and
mysterious forest of the mind  i doubt not but that i should achieve the
same results as if i had started upon my journey with a dream  if this be
true  and i firmly believe that it is  in the case of that universally used
and apparently inconsequential word  the   to which the normal person can be
expected to have such a large number of associations  of varying degrees of
intimacy or remoteness  how much truer is it when we have such a definite
mental fact or mental state as a dream as the starting point of our hunting
expedition 

the dream gives us something tangible to start with  something near at home
to the dreamer or patient  something interesting and amusing to him 
something baffling and so frequently unintelligible to him  and  as a
consequence  a more conscientious  earnest and wholehearted co operation can
be obtained from the person whose mental life is being investigated  here is
something vivid to him  something of personal interest to him  and so we can
look to him to lend us his aid in better spirit and in fuller measure than
might otherwise be obtainable 

i have been referring in my previous remarks  for the most part  to
unravelment of the normal individual s life history  but my remarks are
equally applicable to a mentally disturbed individual s life history and to
the genesis of abnormal psychic states  particularly those to be met with in
the neuroses and psychoneuroses 

so true is the generalization  indeed the truism or dictum here laid down 
that  in only the psychoanalyst knows how many instances  by the analysis of
a single  even the very first dream  one can arrive at the rock bottom depth
of the trouble at hand  yes  at the very genesis of the condition  it is not
my intention in this paper to report such cases in full detail  since the
presentation of even a single such case would be too lengthy for publication
in an ordinary medical or other journal  and in many instances might well go
to make a good sized book  a real autobiography of more or less interest  if
not to the average reader  at least to the psychoanalyst and to the person
who has undergone the psychoanalysis  without attempting to present an
elaborate history or complete analysis  but rather merely to call attention
to the truth of the general problem which is being discussed in this paper 
i shall  however  mention a few definite illustrations of this sort 

a man of sixty was brought to my dispensary clinic by his wife  i say
 brought  and not  accompanied  by his wife  advisedly   she accompanied him
into my examining room   he had an almost complete aphonia  spoke hoarsely
and in a whisper and presented all the signs of abductor laryngeal
paralysis  added to which there was a partial hemiplegia of the right side
involving the upper and lower extremities  but not the face or any of the
cranial nerves other than that supplying the right laryngeal abductor  i
shall not give any other points in the history except that this paralysis
was of four months  duration  there was some resistance to movements at the
elbow and knee  but babinski and other indications of a central organic
lesion were absent  the results of the rest of the physical examination need
not be mentioned except that the patient presented evidences of
arteriosclerosis  the patient was of dull mentality  meek humble and
subservient  he was much below par mentally  i did not put him through any
special intelligence tests   had little information to offer  constantly
resorted to  i don t know  as a reply  and could co operate but little   i
did  however  obtain the important bit of information that seventeen years
ago he had had an almost complete aphonia of several weeks  duration and
that one day  while on board ship  he became seasick  vomited  became
frightened  went to his room  and suddenly his voice returned to him  so
sudden was the transformation that many of his fellow passengers insisted
that he had been deceiving them and had purposely simulated the condition he
had previously presented  the case was one of hysteria  the patient
presenting at the time of my examination signs of abductor laryngeal
paralysis  laryngological examination disclosed a right sided abductor
palsy  and right sided partial hemiplegia 

for the next two visits the wife accompanied  or rather  brought the patient
to the clinic and i could get but little information and consequently
progressed but little   i asked him  in her presence  to come alone the next
time  which he did  the description of the onset of the attack  which was
furnished me on his previous visits  proved the hysterical nature of the
condition  he had suddenly been attacked by nausea and vomiting  fell to the
floor  lay there  more or less unconscious  as he described it  for five or
ten or more minutes  was assisted to his feet  went to his bed with
practically no assistance  a few hours later found that he could speak
little more than above a whisper  and in another few hours or more his right
side became weak and failed him   he had insisted that the onset came on
suddenly  he had denied any quarrels or trouble at home   nothing could be
obtained from him as to his thoughts just prior to the attack or as to any
special emotional shocks 

on his fourth visit i asked him to tell me any dream he had had recently and
which had made an impression upon him   he could give me no aid  nothing
came to mind   i asked him if he had dreamed the night before  and he told
me he had had a dream the afternoon of the preceding day  during an
afternoon nap   here is the dream   he found himself struggling with a
tremendous snake  the upper part of which was in human form  the features
being very hazy and not at all recalled   the snake was vigorously
endeavoring to enwrap itself about him and to strangle him  and he was
desperately and fiercely struggling to defend himself against it and to free
himself from it  and yet he could not fight it off  in desperation and in
fear he cried aloud for help   this was the end of the dream  for  at this
point  members of his family came rushing toward him to inquire what was
wrong with him  and due partly to shock and his own activity in the dream 
and partly perhaps to the noise of the footsteps and of the conversation of
those who came running toward him to inquire into the cause of his
distressful cries  he awoke 

the thoughts and reveries just preceding the dream and the thoughts and
experiences during the morning preceding the dream  although the true
inciters of the dream  and although concerned with the central figure  his
wife  in this little drama  need not be detailed since the dream has a wider
and more deeply arising significance 

i could not learn definitely from him whether the series of associated
thoughts turned first from his wife to his troubles with her  to her
attitude toward him  and then to her resemblance in this respect  her
nagging  pestering persistence and actual persecution of him  to a snake
which is endeavoring to enwrap itself about him  to strangle him  to
withdraw from him his very life s blood  etc  this may or may not have been
the line of associations just preceding the dream 

he had no idea as to what the dream meant   using free association  in
ordinary face to face conversation  i asked him what  snake  reminded him
of   the association came in a moment   he smiled  became embarrassed  said
it was foolish of him to tell me this  but it reminded him of his wife  he
had always looked upon his wife as a snake in human form  he had frequently
called her  snake  because of her conduct toward him  she had wound herself
about his life in snake like fashion 

and then came the story of their troubles   this was his second wife  she
was fifteen years his junior   he was meek  feeble  of weak will power 
without initiative   she was domineering  although his wife never told him
so openly and in so many words  he felt convinced that the trouble had begun
more or less because his wife s sexual libido was not satisfied in her
sexual relations with him  he admits that she is a passionate woman  her
sexual libido was of such strength that he  much older than she  and not too
strong physically  could but little gratify her   the first complaints and
the sole trouble which appeared on the surface were financial  he barely
made a living and she complained thereat continually  bitterly and
tyrannically  it seems that her complaint in this direction was justified 
it is difficult to determine just what role her lack of sexual gratification
played   whether it only acted as stirring up the embers of dissatisfaction
 with his weekly earnings  which already existed  or whether it was the
basic factor  led to her dissatisfaction with her matrimonial choice  and
caused her to seek some more or less valid cause for complaint  in that way
permitting her  more or less consciously  to transfer her dissatisfaction
and discontent from the lack of sexual gratification to the hard pressed
financial condition  which perhaps she might  for that matter  have been
willing to endure  did she but obtain the full gratification of her sexual
craving   at any rate  both of these factors played their role in causing
domestic disagreement  one factor being openly acknowledged as the cause by
his wife  the other factor never mentioned by her  but believed by him to be
an important accessory  if not the main  fundamental and primary source of
the trouble  his wife  using his poor earning capacity as a weapon  and with
the demand for  more money  as her battle cry  carried on a campaign of
complaint  grumbling  nagging  fault finding  insult and abuse  but little
short of persecution  making conditions wretched and miserable at home 
things at length became quite unbearable to him  so much so that  feeble in
willpower and lacking in initiative as he was and is  he was compelled to
leave home and live with his aunt  since his wife had practically deserted
him   although she had sold out the furniture and the rest of the
furnishings of the home  and had pocketed the money thus received  she
repeatedly called at his aunt s home for no other purpose than to force him
to pay her sums of money for her weekly maintenance  on each such visit she
would act the tyrant  would storm and rage furiously  would subject him to
stinging rebukes and deliver biting tongue lashings  causing him in
consequence to be much upset and nervous the rest of the day  the very
morning on which he had had the attack  which was followed by his present
trouble  partial aphonia and partial hemiplegia  his wife had paid him one
of these unusually stormy and noisy  and  to say the least  unwelcome
visits   she had carried the attack to such a point that our patient became
so emotionally upset  he is a harmless  emotional  kindly  unassuming and
indifferent sort of old fellow  that he suddenly was attacked with nausea
and vomiting  and  frightened  fell to the floor  with the consequences
above detailed  i need not go further into the history and analysis of this
case  but the story thus far elicited is more than sufficient to show that
here we have a specific instance in which  by the analysis of a single
dream  we have arrived at the genesis of an hysterical paralytic syndrome of
four months  duration   the analysis took but a few minutes  it may be
mentioned  in parentheses  that a full knowledge of the cause of the
condition did not lead to a disappearance of the palsy  in other words  as
we all know  knowledge per se does not lead to action or to the assertion or
development of the will power  i may say  also  that the events here related
were not suppressed or repressed  for  as soon as the question of his wife
was taken up  the patient admitted that it was she who was the real cause of
his present conditions  and he thereupon detailed the story above related 
he assured me that he had always been fully aware that it was she who had
brought about his present condition  although  of course  he did not know
whether he had had an hysterical  apoplectic or other sort of attack  in
fact he believed his condition was permanent and incurable   especially
since he had been treated at various neurological clinics for many weeks
past without the slightest improvement or progress 

were we to follow up this history we could unearth the full life history of
this patient  including the genesis of his early attack of aphonia  but i
deem this unnecessary and inadvisable in this paper  as mentioned
previously 

here  then  we have a definite case in which by the analysis of a single and
incidentally the first dream we have arrived at the genesis of the
psychoneurotic disorder 

from this same standpoint i have studied another case  a married woman of
twenty nine  with marked neurasthenic and hysterical symptoms  including
astasia abasia  anesthesias  palpitation of the heart  throbbing sensations
in the stomach and a great many other symptoms   this case i studied for
upwards of four months  with almost daily visits to the hospital where she
was being cared for   i made quite an intensive study of her dream life and
of her past life history  and i find that had i taken the very first dream
which i obtained from her and conducted a thorough analysis with this dream
as my first mile post  i would have arrived at a full genesis of the
condition  which was of ten years  duration   in this case  also  i must
repeat  there was no indication of repression  the patient having always
understood very well the origin and cause of her condition  here  too  we
find that the knowledge alone did not lead to her recovery  this case i
shall report in detail at a later date 

in this connection  i cannot keep from reciting the dream of a young girl of
twelve which i had the good fortune to study  she came to me complaining
about her throat   there was something dry   a sticking  in her throat   she
did not know what it was  would i look at her throat   i found nothing
abnormal  and was about to dismiss her when i observed that her hands were
bluish  i felt them   they were cold   i thought at once of probable heart
disease   i was soon informed that she had heart disease  she had been told
so by other doctors   this proved to be the case  as i learned on examining
her 

being keenly interested in this subject of dreams  i wondered whether  if
she were subject to periods of cardiac decompensation of varying degree  she
did not have dreams of a terrifying nature  about burglars  robbery and the
like   because of embarrassment of breathing during sleep  resulting from
her cardiac insufficiency and consequent circulatory and respiratory
disturbance  i asked her whether she had been dreaming much of late  she
told me she had had a dream the preceding night  what was it   i inquired 

she had dreamed that she had died   her mother had put her in a coffin 
carried her to the cemetery and then proceeded to bury her   her mother had
first forced something into her mouth  it seemed to be a whitish powder  
and then lowered her into the grave and filled the grave with dirt  that is
all that she could remember 

i shall not enter into a complete analysis or interpretation of this dream 
there is no doubt  however  to every psychoanalyst who has devoted his
attention to dreams  that the analysis of such a dream should prove most
interesting   it is also apparent that by taking up the various elements of
the dream and following them untiringly along the various trails and
ramifications which lead on in various directions  one could unmask the
entire life history of this twelve year old girl 

i wish  however  to direct the reader s attention to only one aspect of this
dream  the death of the dreamer  she denied that she feared death or that
she thought of death because of her heart disease or from any other cause  i
next inquired    do you wish or have you ever wished you were dead    the
reaction of the girl was immediate and intense  she stood frightened 
embarrassed  her eyelids twitched convulsively in rapid succession  her face
gradually assumed a suppressed crying expression  tears came to her eyes 
they soon flowed freely and rolled down her cheeks  she sobbed  and  through
her tears  she uttered  almost inarticulately  the one word   yes    a
convulsive  inspiratory grunt  a bashful  receding  turning away of the head
and body  a raising of the hands to cover her face and hide her tears  and
hasty  running steps to get away  while murmuring audibly  let me go away  
followed rapidly one upon the other  i gently seized her hand  calmed and
reassured her  and  through sobs and tears  in almost inaudible tones  in
starts and spurts  and reluctantly replying to questions which were forced
upon her  producing replies which were literally drawn from her against her
will  she told me this little story  a little boy cousin of hers  three
years her junior  had begun school two years or so later than she  and yet 
in spite of this handicap  this little relative had outstripped her in
school  he being now in a higher grade than she herself was  she would not
be so much concerned or worried about this not to be proud of performance 
had not the boy s mother that week visited her home and there  in the
presence of other people  talked considerably about her boy s progress in
school  his rapid advance as compared with that of our little dreamer  her
relative stupidity and backwardness   and so this boy s mother had continued
for some time in the same strain  this caused our little girl to feel much
embarrassed  in fact  ashamed and mortified   she had felt that way for
several days past  it had made her cry  had made her feel miserable and
unhappy  so much so that she had wished she were dead  i shall not continue
this analysis further   but it is plainly seen that here too  by a single
dream  we have come upon life experiences  viewpoints and mental material
which affords us efficient and sufficient weapons to boldly attack the
fortress of her full life history  her mental qualities  her trends  her
psychic depth  her mental makeup in its entirety  in its every dimension 

it is interesting to note that on the morning following the experience which
i had with this child  she came to see me a second time  and  on my
examining her throat  it presented the typical picture of bilateral
tonsillitis  the final result of the initial sticking sensation in her
throat  which she had experienced the day before   after taking a culture
from her throat as a matter of routine to exclude a possible diphtheria  the
patient  greatly disturbed because of her newly discovered trouble  burst
forth into bitter tears  and  still sobbing  rushed abruptly from the room 

a week later  when i saw her again  she had regained her emotional
equilibrium and we reviewed her dream and its analysis without any special
signs of emotional disturbance 

very interesting  also  was my experience about a week following this when 
casually reciting this little girl s dream  its significance and her
conduct  to an old lady whom i know very well  i found that she too was
presenting all the signs of emotional upset  for  as i proceeded with my
recital  tears gradually came to her eyes  her face assumed a suppressed
crying expression  she tried to smile through her tears  and finally  unable
to control her emotions  she broke out into a free and unrestrained weeping
spell  following which i learned from her that the recital of this girl s
condition  her dream and its meaning  recalled to her mind her darling
daughter  a noble girl of sixteen years of age  who had died some fifteen
years ago  after a long period of incapacitation and a miserable existence
brought on by tonsillitis  chorea  rheumatism and  finally  heart disease 
with all the extreme signs and symptoms of broken cardiac and renal
compensation  here  then  i had touched another complex  which  if followed
up  would lead me into the innermost depths and recesses of this old lady s
soul life  into the holiest of holies of her mental life 

the writer will be pardoned for not here giving fuller histories  or for not
carrying out the analyses to their ultimate goals  or for not giving the
interpretations of the two dreams presented  that was not the primary object
of this communication 

i wish  in conclusion  to repeat that through the conscientious and most
far reaching analysis of a single dream  or  in fact  of a single element of
a dream or a single element or stimulus in the objective or subjective
world  one may  at least not infrequently  unearth the full life history of
normal or abnormal individuals  and the genesis and evolution of
psychopathic affections 

the reader may justly inquire why the analyst should resort to dream
analysis instead of taking the history of the case in the usual way  in all
cases the patient should be permitted to tell her story in her own way 
this method of procedure  with cross questioning  may and should indeed be
sufficient to unravel the case for us in most cases  but if we find that we
have not gained the confidence of the patient and have not that condition of
being en rapport with the patient which is essential for progress and
success in the analysis  one may resort to dream analysis  not so much for
the purpose of following the royal road to what the freudian school calls
 the unconscious   but rather with the object of obtaining the confidence of
the patient and of having something definite to start with 



an act of everyday life treated as a pretended dream and interpreted by
psychoanalysis

by raymond bellamy

professor of education  emory and henry college  emory  va 

a recent article by brill  entitled  artificial dreams and lying   1 
recalled to me a little work i did two years ago while engaged in making an
introductory study of dreams as a thesis at clark university   the part
which is hereby submitted is a fragment of a larger work and  being only a
sort of side issue  was never included in the thesis proper  i have made
only such changes as were made necessary by the fact that this is a fragment
and needed one or two minor changes to make it complete 

 1  journal abnormal psychology  vol  9  no  5 

let me say at the beginning that i have the greatest and most profound
respect for freudian theories as interpreted by g  stanley hall and other
men of like scholarly ability  but i have never been able to accept the more
extreme form of freudianism as interpreted by some of the most prolific
writers in this field   i have found that the charges made by habermann 2 
are substantially true  i find it very helpful indeed  to try to interpret
my own dreams and to assist some of my students to do so according to the
freudian formula  and to a certain point i believe these interpretations are
undoubtedly true  the question is to find the point beyond which the
interpretation becomes artificial   personally  i believe that this will
always have to be decided finally by the individual himself rather than by
some outsider who insists on reading in a certain interpretation  i have
come to believe that it is possible for one to become trained to the point
at which he is able to decide just how far the interpretation goes  or  at
least  to approximate it 

 2  journal abnormal psychology  vol  9  no  4 

with these few introductory remarks i shall submit the paper  which was
written in 1912   i have not appended the rather long and cumbersome
bibliography from which i drew these references  but i can supply any
reference that is wanted 

if we examine the freudian system  we find that it is impossible to disprove
this theory of dreams   if we demonstrate that a dream has no sexual
connection whatever  they have only to say that it is the censor that
blinds  and  by resorting to symbolism and other such very present helps in
time of trouble  they show plainly that we were mistaken   the situation is
the same as it would be if i declared that what i saw as blue appeared
yellow to the rest of the world  the disproof of this and of freudianism are
equally impossible  but  on the other hand  have the freudians presented any
proof or argument on the affirmative side of this question   they are over
fond of saying   freud has proven thus and so   but in what did the proof
consist  the great answer to all objections has been to analyze dreams and 
so far as i know  the attempt has never failed to show that the dream in
question conformed to the prescribed requirements   and in truth  it is not
a difficult matter to analyze a dream a la freud   after a little practice 
especially if one has a vivid imagination and is somewhat suggestible  it is
possible to find the repressed sexual wish in every dream   but if we use
such flexible and wonderful factors as the four mechanisms  and  above all 
symbolism  we can find the same things in any other experience   by this i
mean that if we take a bit out of our daily life  a dream of some one else 
a fictitious story  an historical incident  or any other pictured situation
and pretend that it is one of our own dreams and apply the freudian
analysis  we find that it serves for this purpose as well as a real dream 
when this is the case  it is absurd to put any faith in the analysis of real
dreams  when carried to extremes 

as an illustration of the above statement  the following is a fairly typical
example   the supposed  dream  is a commonplace bit out of my daily life 
this is chosen at random  although jones would say such a thing is
impossible  and subjected to a dream analysis 

analysis of false dream

dream   i was walking along a street on a cold winter night  i looked down
at the cement walk and in this was set a piece of granite on which the
letters  w  h   were cut   coming to the corner  i looked up and saw on a
short board which was nailed to a post  the name of the street   queen
street   the street running at right angles to this was king street  and i
turned and went down this  after walking a short distance  i came to a house
from a window of which a light was shining   the house number was  23   i
took a key from my pocket  unlocked the door and entered 

analysis   in attempting to analyze this  so called  dream  i was amazed to
find with how many past longings and emotionally colored experiences it was
associated  i first took up the letters on the sidewalk  and as i repeated
them  letting my mind be as blank as possible in order that the associations
might be free  i gained an immediate response   w  h     which house   came
out as in answer to a question  with these words there was a definite visual
image of a young country farm youth standing talking to two persons in a
buggy  i remembered the incident in all its details  i was the young man and
these people were asking the way to a certain place  or at which house they
should stop  as it so happened  i was at that time keeping company with a
young lady who lived at the very house concerning which they asked  i will
not go into detail any further at this point  for this is a real case and i
should be trespassing on personal ground  but any one who yet remembers his
boyhood courtship  with all its agonies and fears  its hopes and joys  its
disappointments and its pleasures  can see at a glance how important this
occasion is in throwing light on the meaning of the dream  of course  w  h  
stood for  which house  

i seemed to get no further in my associations with these letters at this
time  and my thoughts spontaneously turned to the name of the street 
 queen street    even more readily and completely than in the other case 
there came a whole complex of associations  first there was the name and
image of miss agnes queen  whom i had known for years   but  strange to say 
the image was of this young lady standing and talking to a certain mr 
harding   i saw them together but once  and it seemed passing strange that
this incident should be the one remembered in connection with the name  but
the associations were rapidly progressing  and i mentally reviewed parts of
three or four years during which i was working and closely associating with
this mr  harding   here i began to see some light  this mr  harding was in
all respects  at least as far as i knew him a man of good morals  but he was
much less particular in his social habits than i was   he was engaged to a
young lady all the time i was with him  and wrote letters to her constantly 
but this fact did not prevent him from paying attentions to other young
women  and i was aware that he was more familiar with them than
conventionality would warrant   in fact he made no attempt to be secret in
the matter  and often poked fun at me for my over sensitivity on the
subject   here was the key to a whole lot of meaning  the first year i was
with him  i had no sweetheart or any lady friend on whom to center my
affection or to whom i could write  there were a number of young men in our
 squad   as it was called  and nearly all of them had correspondents and it
was a joke among us that i was  out in the cold world with no one to love  
in reality  this was not so much a joke for me at the time  as i tried to
give the impression that it was  and i longed for the very thing of which we
joked   the fact that i was out on the street on a cold winter night in this
dream symbolized being  out in the cold world   as we had used the term
then 

i now took up the letters  w  h   again  and the words  white horse  came in
response to the stimulus   with little hesitation i placed this as connected
with the knights of the white horse of whom tennyson writes in his poems of
 king arthur s knights of the round table    i got very little out of this 
but still the white horse was a band of men who were unrestrained in their
desires and bore about the same relation to king arthur s knights that
harding did to me   however  the associations did not stop here but went on 
giving what at first seemed to be a meaningless list of words   w  h   first
called up the words   wish harding   next   will harding   next   with
harding   and last   walk harding    in a minute it flashed on me what this
all meant    i wish to do as harding is doing  to walk the way he is with
him and i will    to walk up queen street meant  then  to follow his
example  as he at one time paid some attention to this miss agnes queen 
perhaps the reason why her name was selected instead of some others was
because his relations to her had been very slight and formal  and thus the
idea was easier for the censor to let into sleeping consciousness than it
would have been if some other names had been taken   w  h    then 
symbolized the four expressions that arose in the analysis 

the meaning of  king street  came last of anything in the dream  but i will
give it now   i did not seem to be able to get anywhere on this for some
time  and the idea kept presenting itself that it symbolized that i was king
of the situation which seemed innocent enough  but at last there came an
association with nero as portrayed in  quo vadis    i then remembered how i
read this book while in the adolescent stage  and how a cousin made remarks 
very sensuous in their nature  about parts of it   i then got a vision of
the book   mad majesties   which i saw on the library table not long since 
next came a memory of the french kings as portrayed in the works of dumas 
at this point  i realized that the idea suggested by the word king is very
often  though not always  an idea or image of a very loose person as far as
his social life is concerned  thus to walk queen street or follow the
example of harding finds a parallel in walking king street or following the
example of a king 

with the light in the window  i came into an entirely new field of
associations   i cannot go far into detail here as it would involve others
as well as myself  but suffice to say that the light in the window called up
a paper on the subject of light which was written by a mr  x  and read in my
hearing   now mr  x  and i had both kept company with the same young lady at
different times  and here was another group of emotionally colored
experiences  however  the important function performed by the light was that
it symbolized  together with the house in which it was  the comforts  warmth
and pleasures of the very opposite condition from that of being  out in the
cold world with no one to love  

the house number  23  is associated with at least two occasions  one sunday
evening  a few of the boys of our  squad   myself among them  went out with
the daughter of our landlady  and one or two other young ladies and took a
boat ride in the park  it was a beautiful summer night and the park was full
of young people who were treating each other to very endearing caresses 
there were so many who wanted boats that only one boat was unoccupied  and
it was no  23   it had been left because it was a hoodoo number  and the
other boaters were all superstitious  as we were not  we took this boat and
used it   my longing lonesomeness was about at its maximum height on this
night  the other occasion associated with this number is that i became
engaged when i was twenty three years old and at that time desired greatly
to be married  but  as i was in school  it had to be postponed 

now the climax of the dream   i took a key from my pocket  unlocked the door
and entered   this is so plain that it hardly needs comment  being in the
cold world  as symbolized by the cold street  i enter the warmth and comfort
of the lighted house   the key and lock are  of course  phallic symbols and
have special significance for me as i once took a young lady to a banquet at
which the favors were paper keys and hearts  thus symbolically are fulfilled
all the longings i felt while with harding  all my desires to be married
when twenty three  all my adolescent courtship yearnings  and all my
remaining repressed sexual longings 

as a point which may have a little bearing on this  i have recently received
a letter from harding and in it was information that he is for a time away
from home  and i wondered if he is still careless in his behavior 

this analysis will seem foolish in the extreme to many  and i am one of the
number  but my excuse is that i have copied as closely after the freudians
as possible   i have only to invite a comparison  this is not a  made up 
dream  but a little bit out of my daily life  just an experience occurring
on the way home from the seminary  the analysis is real in the sense that
the associations arose as i have recorded them 

perhaps some ardent freudian might find it in his heart to say that this
analysis only strengthened their position  as it showed how a whole sexual
background underlies our entire life  and therefore our dreams must have a
sexual origin  but the reason why i found a sexual solution of this was that
i started the analysis with a definite bewnssteinlage  as titchener would
call it  which consisted of a knowledge that i had started for a certain
kind of solution  and the whole course of the associations was governed by
this   if freud had at first come into the possession of a theory that every
dream fulfills a fear  or pictures a state of anger or any other emotion  he
would have had just as good success in demonstrating the truth of his
statements   the following analysis will illustrate this  this is a real
dream  but before beginning the analysis  i took the attitude that the
analysis would reveal the fulfillment of a fear or show that the dream was
the dramatic representation of a feared condition as actually existing  it
took some time to get into this attitude  it is true  but when the result
was finally accomplished  the analysis was begun and the attempt was made to
follow the freudian method as closely as possible under the changed
conditions 

the dream   on the night of february first  i dreamed that i was going down
a little hill in company with my brother and mr  n  we seemed to be in
colorado  and at the foot of the hill was a little stream which was very
pretty  there was a little waterfall  and a green pool below it  and a mist
hung over the pool   i am not sure i saw the color of this pool  there was
also a huge rock around which the water dashed  some people were fishing in
the stream   some one asked if we could see the rainbows  and mr  n  replied
that he could see only one  i then looked carefully and saw a purple haze in
the mist over the pool and supposed this was what was meant   but  as i
continued to look  i saw a great number of rainbows  or at least patches in
the mist over the water which showed the spectral colors  these were about
two feet in diameter and extraordinarily beautiful  i was very anxious to
get some of the trout which i felt sure were in the stream   as we came
nearer  it seemed that the stream had overflowed and there were several
shallow pools not over a foot deep and eight or ten feet long  in these
pools could be seen fish by the dozen from a foot to eight feet long   i was
slightly troubled because it would muddy my shoes  but i began to try to get
some of them out  i got one very big one by the gill slit  but could not
manage him and had to let him go   i handled several in the dream  but do
not know whether or not i got any out 



analysis of dream showing fulfillment of a fear

i had some trouble in getting any light on this dream  but suddenly much of
the meaning became clear and a whole group of associations came up 
undoubtedly the trouble i experienced at first was caused by the resistance
of the censor  i will give the associated memories first and explain them
later 

i delight in fishing and have spent many happy hours fishing for trout in
the clear waters of the colorado streams  but  strange as it may seem  it
was not a memory of any of these which come into consciousness  instead 
there came up memories of three different instances  each accompanied with
definite visual imagery  and in such rapid succession that i could hardly
tell which came first 

six years ago last summer  i crossed the ohio river to spend a day in
carrolton  kentucky  and on the way back  i bought some fish of a fisherman
at the river s edge   this man was barefooted and wore a little greasy wool
hat and very ragged clothes  i remember thinking at the time that his work
must be very degrading  and that the river fisherman must be about the
lowest type in that part of the country   i especially noticed his feet and
legs  which were bare to the knees  and which were so sunburned that they
hardly looked like parts of a white man s body  in the analysis of this
dream  the image of the man as he stood there and the memory of the incident
came back with great vividness 

a year or two later  my brother and i were riding along the road at about
the same place  and we met a very miserable looking specimen of humanity 
driving a poor limping horse to a rickety wagon in which were some pieces of
driftwood   my brother was in a  spell of the blues  at this time  and he
remarked that he was coming to just that condition as fast as he could  the
image and memory of this incident also came into consciousness as if it had
been waiting repressed just under the surface 

the other memory was one in which i did not figure personally  a year or so
ago  my brother was telling me how he and his boy had gone to the river
several times and gone fishing with an old fisherman who lived there   my
nephew  like most boys  had a desire to become a fisherman or hunter  and my
brother had suspected that a little close acquaintance with the way a
fisherman lived would cure him of this desire  in this he was entirely
right  and after a few trips to visit the old fellow  he had expressed
himself as cured of any desire to live the beautiful  pleasant life of a
river fisherman 

without going any further  it can easily be seen that a fisherman symbolizes
for me everything that is synonymous with failure  thus  when i stepped out
into the muddy water and began fishing i symbolically became a failure  a
no account  a man who had failed in the struggle and had not achieved
success   the very fact that we came down hill to the place of fishing
shows  on the face of it  that a downhill career is symbolized   my brother
was with me  and that is easily explained as a dramatization of the fact
that i was accompanying him on that downhill road to the state of the man in
the rickety wagon which he had prophesied as his future  the water in the
shallow pools was muddy  and i stepped into it just after experiencing a
fear that i would get my shoes wet  remembering the fisherman s bare brown
feet  this can be interpreted as nothing but a very strong symbolization of
a drop from a cultured and successful circle to a low and unsuccessful one 
i grasp a fish bigger than myself and struggle with it  but am compelled to
give it up   another symbol   my work is plainly too big for me  this
question is too much for me to handle  and this thesis will ultimately have
to be given up as the big fish is  in fact  i cannot say that i succeeded in
getting any fish out of the water and  therefore  i shall never succeed at
anything i undertake  but will land figuratively  if not actually  in the
fisherman s hut 

the mr  n  who was with us  was cross eyed which  in itself  seemed to have
no special meaning  but it immediately called up an image of a cross eyed
man standing at the river s edge at vevay  indiana   this fellow was the
picture of ignorance and want  he was telling another man about catching a
big fish a few days before and how he liked that kind of fish boiled so
well  but he could not wait for it to boil  but had fried part of it and
eaten it that way   as i heard him relate this and watched his face  the
whole event seemed to me to be most disgusting  as i was watching him  some
one at my side told me that  because of a drunken spree  he had been
disfranchised  he was also a fisherman and another typical specimen of the
class  mr  n   having the same facial defect  though in a much less
noticeable way  became identified with him  and i am again found walking
down the hill to oblivion in company with this brother in distress  this is
bad for mr  n   but it cannot be helped 

the rainbows seem bright enough  but they bring in another disquieting group
of associations   the rainbow is almost  if not quite  a universal symbol of
failure   we all know the old story of going to the end of the rainbow for a
pot of gold  and if we want to belittle any effort we say that the
individual is chasing the rainbow  so here i am again on the downhill road
between two failures  following the rainbow to a hopeless condition of muddy
uselessness  and if it were not bad enough to be following one rainbow  i am
following a great number which must mean that i shall always end in failure
whatever i undertake 

but  besides this  the rainbow has special associations for me  the first of
these associations which came into consciousness was a little booklet made
by a latin student and handed her professor  i had several years of greek
and latin under this teacher and at a certain place in the course  he asked
each student to make a little booklet of some kind  using as much
originality as possible  copy some favorite quotations from de senectute and
hand in the finished product  every year he gets these out and exhibits them
as a kind of inspiration  one of them had a rainbow and a pot of gold on the
cover  i spent a great deal of time and work on mine and made a more
elaborate booklet than any other that had been made  but i purposely left it
unfinished and inscribed a statement that this was to typify the kind of
work i did in that department   of course it was a joke  but i have often
thought that there was method in this madness  and that it really
approximated the true state of affairs  this seeming chance association 
then  is closely connected with my fear of making a failure which is so
clearly dramatized in this dream 

the fact that the dream is placed in colorado is also important  two years
ago  i spent the summer in colorado and had a very delightful time  as was
natural  being on a wedding trip  but during this stay  i did make a total
failure at fishing  i had been a fairly successful trout fisher a few years
before  but i had forgotten the art and did not do enough fishing to
relearn  in other words  my dream gives me to understand that i cannot be
successful even in fishing   one evening my bride and i witnessed a most
beautiful sunset  a rainbow figuring largely in the scene  at this time we
were debating whether or not to go on farther west as i had originally
planned  but circumstances prevented this and instead of going on farther 
we came back east or toward the rainbow  this is just one more place where
the dream so clearly symbolizes a failure to do what i undertake   i will
not carry the analysis any further  though i could find associations by the
hundred which would strengthen the meaning given 

of course i am not at all conscious of having any such fear as this  in fact
i am rather inclined to be over confident  but this is  of course  due to
the repressing influence of the censor and only strengthens the analysis 

examples could be given until the last trump is sounded and the world rolled
up like a scroll  but i do not want to keep any one so long  whatever we
wish to make out of a dream  the dramatization of a fear  a joy  a joke
 really this is what the freudians often do   a tragedy  anything that can
be suggested  the result can easily be accomplished if only we be allowed
the use of freud s mechanisms and a moderate amount of symbolism 

i have tried to show   first  that any situation or experience can be
analyzed with as good success as a dream  and second  that a dream may be
made to mean anything   in other words  with freud s method  one can
demonstrate anything to suit his taste or belief   long ago  the saying was
formulated that all roads lead to rome   this being true  it must also be
true that all roads lead everywhere else   freud employs a wonderful figure
of a mystical sphere  with its layers and cross veins and other
mineralogical characteristics  to represent the part of consciousness with
the repressed factor at the center well guarded  it would be far more to the
point if he should represent the whole of past experience as the surface of
a country  with its various roads connecting the different centers   the
stations would then represent the experiences  and the roads the association
tracks between them  if one should travel at random over these roads  he
would in time pass through all kinds of towns and cities  but if he started
in quest of a certain type  say mountain villages  he would arrive at his
goal much more quickly than he would otherwise   the freudians themselves
acknowledge that they have difficulty in knowing when to stop the analysis 
their plan seems to be to travel until the landscape suits them and then get
off and camp 

thus  while i have made no attempt to give positive proof or argument that
freud s theory  in its extreme form is at fault  i have tried to
substantiate my argument that there has been no real argument on the other
side   and when a theory so spectacular and altogether out of the ordinary
is presented  the burden of the proof should very decidedly be thrown on the
positive side  we have no obligation or even excuse for accepting such a
theory on the mere presumption of the originator 

and that freud s theory is weird and fantastic is a self evident fact 
perhaps the clark university student who very carefully worked it up a few
years ago went a little too far when he said it was a chaotic inferno  but
at any rate  it is far removed from celestial harmony  sidis takes about the
sanest attitude possible when he refers to certain freudian writings as
being full of unconscious sexual humor  he observes further as does prince
and others that the freudian school is in reality a religious or
philosophical sect  he says that freud s writings constitute the
psychoanalytic bible and are quoted with reverence and awe   kronfeld  in a
most valuable criticism  says that in comparison with freud s conception of
the vorconscious and its work  henroth s demonomania appears a modest
scientific theory 

the attitude of the freudians is  itself  worth noticing  they are very
prone to consider any criticism as very personal  and fly to the rescue with
all the fervor of a religious fanatic  a work on dreams  because it does not
bear out freud in all details  calls forth thunderbolts from two continents 
this over anxious attitude indicates that the belief in the theory is based
on an emotional condition rather than logical reasoning  bernard hart  who
is one of those happy individuals who get the best out of freudianism  shows
the difference between the two kinds of belief by comparing our belief that
the earth goes around the sun and that the man who abuses a woman is a cad 
the cold  indifferent attitude toward the former is in marked contrast to
our warm lively interest in the latter  and the reason is that the belief in
the one is founded on scientific demonstration and in the other on our
feeling in the matter  if we allow this as a gauge by which to measure  it
is not difficult to place the freudians 

we must not overlook the immense opportunity for suggestion in the work of
psychoanalysis  both on the subject and the one who is in the work  the
freudians vehemently deny that any of the results of dream analysis are
suggested into the mind of the dreamer  but the evidences are all on the
other side   freud  in referring to psychoanalysis of hysterical patients 
says   it is not possible to press upon the patient things which he
apparently does not know  or to influence the results of the analysis by
exciting his expectations   such an attitude is fatal when it comes to a
question of accurate work  and no less important is the self suggestion
practiced by the freudians   when we read of freud s long struggle in an
attempt to find something which he felt surely was to be found  we see that
he had abundant opportunity to acquire almost an obsession  the long years
since  which he has spent in analyzing dreams and making them all come out
right some way  would serve to more firmly ground his conviction  and the
same is true of his disciples  put a man to drawing square moons for ten
years  and at the end of the time he will swear that the moon is square 

a large portion of the scientific world seems to have gone mad over the term
 psychoanalysis    but this kind of work has been done by all peoples and
times under different names   there can be no objection to such an analysis
of a dream if it is done by the right person  the dream may be used to aid
the dreamer in finding out his own life  it is true  and when we understand
psychoanalysis as this process  and only this  it is not objectionable   but
if such is the case there is no need of all the mechanism and symbolism  the
preacher who uses the old testament stories of the wars with the philistines
to illustrate a moral struggle is not to be criticised  but if he maintains
that they were written for that purpose  we should hardly feel inclined to
accept his position  a very inspiring message might be builded on the text 
 the ants are a people not strong  but they prepare their meat in the
summer   but it is hardly possible that such thoughts were in the mind of
the writer  just so  a dream or a story or any other situation may be used
to open the locked doors of a life  but to say that the dream has slipped
stealthily out of the keyholes and over the transoms and wonderfully 
mysteriously and magically clothed itself is quite another matter 



freud and his school

new paths of psychology

by a  w  van renterghem m d   amsterdam

 concluded 

we are frequently confronted with the question   just why does an erotic
conflict cause the neurosis  why not just as well another conflict    to
this the only answer is   no one asserts that this must be so  but evidently
it always is so  in spite of anything that can be said against it  it is 
notwithstanding all assurances to the contrary  still true that love  taken
in its large sense of nature s course  which does not mean sexuality alone  
with its problems and its conflicts of the most inclusive significance  has
in human life and in the regulation of the human lot a much greater
importance than the individual can image 

the trauma theory  meaning what was in the beginning conceived by breuer and
freud  is therefore out of date   when freud came to the opinion that a
hidden erotic conflict forms the real root of the neurosis  the trauma lost
its pathogenic significance 

an entirely different light was now thrown upon the theory  the trauma
question was solved  and thrown aside  next in order came the study of the
question of the erotic conflict  if we consider this in the light of the
chosen example  we see that this conflict contains plenty of abnormal
moments  and at first sight does not suffer comparison with an ordinary
erotic conflict  what is especially striking  seemingly almost unbelievable 
is the fact that it is only the exterior action  the pose  of which the
patient is conscious  while she remains unconscious of the passion which
governs her   in the case in question the actual sexual factor
unquestionably remains hidden  while the field of consciousness is entirely
governed by the patient s pose  a proposition formulating this state of
affairs would read as follows 

in the neurosis there are two erotic inclinations which stand in a fixed
antithesis to each other  and one of these at least is unconscious 

it might be said of this formula  that although perhaps it is adapted to
this case  possibly it is not adapted to all cases  most people  however 
are inclined to believe that the erotic is not so widespread   it is granted
that it is so in a romance  but it is not believed that the most affecting
dramas are more often enacted in the heart of the citizen who daily passes
us by unnoticed  than upon the stage 

the neurosis is an unsuccessful attempt of the individual to solve in his
own bosom the sexual question which perplexes the whole of human society 
the neurosis is a disunity in one s inmost self  the cause of this inward
strife is because in most men the consciousness would gladly hold to its
moral ideal  but the subconsciousness strives toward its  in the present day
meaning  immoral ideal   this the consciousness always wants to deny  these
are the sort of people who would like to be more respectable than they are
at bottom   but the conflict may be reversed  there are people who
apparently are very disreputable  and who do not take the slightest pains to
limit their sexual pleasures  but looked at from all sides this is only a
sinful attitude  adopted  god knows for what grounds  because in them  back
of this  there is a soul  which is kept just as much in the subconsciousness
as the immoral nature is kept in the subconscious of moral men   it is best
for men to avoid extremes as far as possible  because extremes make us
suspect the contrary  

this general explanation was necessary in order to explain to some extent
the conception of the erotic conflict in analytical psychology  it is the
turning point of the entire conception of the neurosis 

after breuer s discovery  putting into practice the  chimney sweeping  so
justly christened by his patient this method of treatment has evolved into
shorter psychoanalytical methods  which we will now discuss in succession in
their main points 

in his use of the primitive method  freud depended upon the time saving of
hypnotism and upon the circumstance that many could not be brought into the
desired deep degree of provoked sleep  the aim of this operation was to call
up in the patient another state of consciousness  in which it would be
possible for him to remember facts which had given cause for the origin of
the phenomena  facts which thus far had remained hidden from the ordinary
daily consciousness  by questioning the patient when in this state  or by
spontaneous production of phantasies communicated by the patient while in
hypnosis  memories come to light and affects connected with them are relaxed
 these are abreagirt  rearranged   as the expression is  and the desired
cure is attained   this just mentioned method  cathartic  cleansing  and
more especially the modified one  which aims especially at the promotion of
a spontaneous production of phantasies communicated by the patient while
under hypnotism  is still used in practice by some investigators   in what
follows we go still further back  freud next sought for a method to render
hypnotism unnecessary   he discovered it by applying an artifice which he
had seen bernheim use during a visit  1887  to the latter s clinic at nancy 
bernheim demonstrated upon a hypnotized patient how the amnesia of the
somnambulist is only an appearance 

with this aim in view  freud from then on ceased to hypnotize his patients
and substituted for that method   spontaneous ideas   this means that when
the analysis of a patient who is awake is obstructed  and has come to a dead
stop  he is told to communicate anything which comes into his mind  no
matter what idea  what thought  even if the thing were very queer to him or
seemed meaningless  in the material thus obtained the thread should be found
leading to the semi forgotten  the thing hidden in the consciousness  in
single cases  where the resistance toward bringing into consciousness the
forgotten or repressed thing  the complex  was slight  this method of
treatment very quickly attains its end  but in others where the resistance
was greater  the spontaneous ideas merely brought about indirect
representations  mere allusions as it were to the forgotten element   here
favorable results either were not so readily obtained  or else were entirely
lacking  in conjunction with this  freud planned a simple method of
interpretation by means of which  from the material thus obtained  the
repressed complexes could be brought to consciousness 

independently of freud  the zurich school  bleuler  jung  had planned the
association method in order to penetrate into the patient s
subconsciousness  the value of this method is chiefly a theoretical
experimental one  it leads to an orientation of large circumference  but
necessarily superficial in regard to the subconscious conflict  complex  

freud compares its importance for the psychoanalyticus  with the importance
of the qualitative analysis for the chemist 

not being completely satisfied with his method of spontaneous ideas freud
sought shorter paths to the subconscious  and therefore undertook the study
of the dream life  dealing with forgetfulness  speaking to one s self 
making mistakes  giving offense to one s self  and with superstition and
absent mindedness  and the study of word quibbles taken in their widest
sense   to all of which we are indebted for the possession of his three
important books   die traumdeutung     first edition 1900  third edition
1912    zur psychopathologie des alltagslebens   1901 1907    der witz und
seine bedeutung zum unbewussten   1905  

because of the discovery of the repressed and the forbidden in the soul
life  the instructions contained in the three last named works are of great
importance and of help to us in the study of the spontaneous ideas of the
patient brought to light by free association  but what is of more importance
for analysis is the study of what may well be termed freud s masterpiece 
 die traumdeutung  

jung expresses himself as follows in regard to freud s ingenious discovery 

 it can be said of the dream that the stone which was despised by the
architect has become the corner stone  the acorn of the dream  of the
ephemeral and inconsiderable product of our soul  dates from the earliest
times   before that  men saw in the dream a prophecy for the future  a
warning spirit  a comforter  a messenger of the gods  now we join forces
with it in order to explore the subconscious  to unravel the mysteries which
it jealously guards and conceals  the dream does this with a completeness
which amazes us  freud s exact analysis has taught that the dream as it
presents itself to us  exhibits merely a facade  which betrays nothing of
the inmost part of the house   but where  by attention to certain rules we
are able to bring the dreamer to express the sudden ideas awakened in him in
talking over the sub division of his dream  then it very quickly appears
that the sudden ideas follow a determined direction  and are centralized
about certain subjects  possessing a personal significance and betraying a
meaning  which in the beginning would not have been suspected back of the
dream  but which stand in a very close symbolical relation  even to details 
to the dream facade  this peculiar thought complex  in which all the threads
of the dream are united  is the looked for conflict in a certain variation
which is determined by the circumstances   what is painful and contradictory
in the conflict is so confused here that one can speak of a
wish fulfillment  let us  however  immediately add that the fulfilled wishes
apparently are not wishes  but are such as frequently are contradictory to
them  as an example let us use the case of a daughter who inwardly loves her
mother and dreams that the latter is dead  much to her sorrow  dreams like
this are frequent   the contents make us think as little as possible of a
wish fulfillment  and so one might perhaps get the idea that freud s
assertion  that the dream presents in dramatic form a subconscious wish of
the dreamer  is unjust 

that happens because the non initiated does not know how to differentiate
between manifest and latent  evident and hidden  dream contents  where the
conflict worked over in the dream is unconscious  the solution  the wish
arising from it  is also unconscious  in the chosen example  the dreamer
wished to have the mother out of the way  in the language of the
subconscious it says  i wish that mother would die   we are aware that a
certain part of the subconscious possesses everything which we can no longer
remember consciously  and especially an entirely thoughtless  childish wish 
one can confidently say that most of what arises from the subconscious has
an infantile character  as does this so simple sounding wish   tell me 
father  if mother died would you marry me    the infantile expression of a
wish is the predecessor of a recent wish for marriage  which in this case we
discover is painful to the dreamer  this thought  the seriousness of the
included meaning is  as we say   repressed into the subconscious  and can
there necessarily express itself only awkwardly and childishly  because the
subconscious limits the material at its disposal  preferably  to memories of
childhood and  as recent researches of the zurich school have shown  to
 memories of the race   stretching far beyond the limits of the individual 

it is not the place here to explain by examples the territory of
dream analysis so extraordinary composed  we must be satisfied with the
results of the study  dreams are a symbolical compensation for a personally
important wish of the daytime  one which had had too little attention  or
which had been repressed  

as a result of the dominant morals  wishes which are not sufficiently
noticed by our waking consciousness and which attempt to realize themselves
symbolically in the dream are as a rule of an erotic nature  therefore it is
advisable not to tell individual dreams in the presence of the initiated 
because dream symbolism is transparent to one acquainted with its
fundamental rules   therefore we have always to conquer in ourselves a
certain resistance before we seriously can be fitted for the task of
unraveling the symbolical composition by patient work  when we finally
comprehend the true meaning of a dream then we at once find ourselves
transposed into the very midst of the secrets of the dreamer and to our
amazement we see that even an apparently meaningless dream is full of sense
and really bears witness of extremely important and serious things
concerning the soul life  this knowledge obliges us to have more respect for
the old superstition concerning the meaning of dreams  a respect which is
far to seek in our present day rationalistic era 

freud correctly terms dream analysis the royal road which leads to the
subconscious  it leads us into the most deeply hidden personal mysteries
and  therefore  in the hand of the physician and the educator is an
instrument not to be too highly valued 

the opposition to this method makes use of arguments which chiefly  as we
will observe  from personal motives  originate in the still strongly
scholastic bent  which the learned thought of the present day exhibits  and
dream analysis is precisely what inexorably lays bare the lying morals and
the hypocritical pose of men  and now for once makes them see the reverse
side of their character   is it to be wondered at that many therefore feel
as if some one were stepping on their toes 

dream analysis always makes me think of the striking statue of worldly
pleasure which stands before the cathedral at basel   the front presents an
archaic sweet smile  but the back is covered with toads and snakes 
dream analysis reverses things and allows the back side to be seen  that
this correct picture of reality possesses an ethical value is what no one
can contradict   it is a painful but very useful operation  which demands a
great deal from the physician as well as from the patient  psychoanalysis
seen from the standpoint of therapeutic technic consists chiefly of numerous
analyses of dreams  these in the course of treatment  little by little 
bring what is evil out of the subconsciousness to the light and submit it to
the disinfecting light of day  and thereby find again many valuable and
pretendedly lost portions of the past  it represents a cathartic of especial
worth  which has a similarity to the socratic  maieutike   the  obstetric  
from this state of affairs one can only expect that psychoanalysis for many
people who have taken a certain pose  in which they firmly believe  is a
real torture  because according to the ancient mystic saying   give what you
have  then shall you receive    they must of their own free will offer as a
price their beloved illusions if they wish to allow something deeper  more
beautiful and more vast to enrich them  only through the mystery of
self sacrifice does the self succeed in finding itself again renewed 

there are proverbs of very old origin which through the psychoanalytical
treatment again come to light   it is surely very remarkable that at the
height to which our present day culture has attained this particular kind of
psychic education seems necessary  an education which may be compared in
more than one respect with the technic of socrates  although psychoanalysis
goes much deeper 

we always discover in the patient a conflict which at a certain point is
connected with the great social problems  and when the analysis has
penetrated to that point  the seemingly individual conflict of the patient
is disclosed as the conflict  common to his environment and his time 

thus the neurosis is really nothing but an individual  unsuccessful to be
sure  attempt to solve a common problem it must be so  because a common
problem  a  question  which plunges the sick man into misery is  i can t
help it   the sexual question   more properly termed the question of the
present day sexual moral 

his increased claim upon life and the joy of life  upon colored  brilliant
reality  must endure the inevitable limitations  placed by reality  but not
the arbitrary  wrong  indefensable limitations which put too many chains
upon the creative spirit mounting from out the depths of animal darkness 
the nervous sufferer possesses the soul of a child  that arbitrary
limitation which represses and the reason for which is not understood  to be
sure it attempts to identify itself with the morals  but by this it is
brought into great conflict and disharmony with itself  on one side it
wishes to submit  on the other to free itself  and this conflict we speak of
as the neurosis 

if this conflict in all its parts were clearly a conscious one  then
naturally no nervous phenomena would arise from it  these phenomena arise
only when man cannot see the reverse side of his being and the urgency of
his problem  only under these circumstances does the phenomena occur which
allows expression to the non conscious side of the soul 

the symptom is thus an indirect expression of the nonconscious wishes 
which  were they conscious to us  would come into a violent conflict with
our conceptions of morals  this shadowy side of the soul withdraws itself 
as has once been said  from the control of the consciousness  by so doing
the patient can exert no influence upon it  cannot correct it and can
neither come to an understanding with it nor get rid of it  because in
reality the patient absolutely does not possess the subconscious passions 
rather they are repressed from out the hierarchy of the conscious soul  they
have become autonomous complexes  which can be brought again into
consciousness only with great resistance through analysis  many patients
think that the erotic conflict does not exist for them  in their opinion the
sexual question is nonsense  they have no sexual feeling   these people
forget that in place of that they are crippled by other things of unknown
origin  they are subject to hysterical moods  bad temper  crossness  from
which they  no less than their associates  suffer  they are tortured by
indigestion  by pains of every sort  and are visited by the whole category
of other nervous phenomena  they have this in place of what they lack in the
sexual territory  because only a few are privileged to escape the great
conflict of civilized man of the present day   the great majority inevitably
takes part in this common discord 

as specimens of dream analysis i will give resumes of two histories of
illness told me by dr  jung 



analysis and cure of a case of nervous prostration

a twenty year old banker s son  from a large city in hungary  suddenly grew
sick two years ago  shortly after his father had suffered an attack of
apoplexy and paralysis of the right side  he is spiritless  restless  not
able to work  cannot use his right arm to write  is powerless to put his
attention on anything  sleeps badly  etc   no treatment has any helpful
effect  he is advised to seek distraction in paris  but this  too  is of no
avail   then  after months of torture  he came to zurich to dr  jung  who
subjected him to analysis  at the second visit the patient behaved extremely
mysteriously  he was much disturbed and appeared to be under the influence
of an anxious dream  which he had dreamt that night  it required some effort
to induce him to tell this dream  and it was only after he had convinced
himself that no one could listen in the hall  that this story  not without
emotion  came out 

 i see in a vault a coffin in which my father lies  and i beside him  in
vain i attempt to remove the lid  and in my horrible fear i awake  

some days were employed with the analysis of this dream  the explanation of
it is   he has a very strong father complex  from childhood up he has always
been with his father  he has assumed the role of his father s wife  has
cared for him  lived for him  he often reproached his mother for not making
enough of the father  for not always cooking his favorite dish  for
sometimes contradicting him  etc   he was always around with his father 
worked at his office  served him in all sorts of ways  and anticipated all
his wishes   now  when the father suddenly became an invalid  the conflict
arose   he identifies himself with the father  his father s invalidism
becomes his own  he cannot think any more  he cannot write any more  and he
sees death approaching  in the dream he is apparently dead  but his youth 
his strength refuses to die  and this is translated in his attempts to get
out of the coffin  which explains the fear 

the explanation brings relaxation   after some days  during which the
patient communicates his secret thoughts in detail  he feels very much
better  his heavy burden has been rolled away  and he cannot find words
enough to express his thanks to the doctor  the latter points out to him
that however natural this feeling of thankfulness may be  it is partly a
symptom of the cure at his hands  he shows the patient how the latter  who
had seen through the analysis that his love for his father has been
exaggerated and morbid  had been able to control this  and how he now
transfers to him  the assisting physician  the need for love  freed from
suffering along the way of sublimated homo sexuality  he impresses upon him
that he must now learn to moderate the sympathy  which he expresses too
feelingly  and that he must not desire to see another father in the doctor 
but simply a friend  who is teaching him to stand on his own feet and to
become an independent man  after a few more weeks the young man was entirely
cured of his neurosis  freed from his exaggerations and returned home a well
man 

analysis of a case of sleeplessness

once when traveling i made the acquaintance of a naturalist who not long
before had completed a famous exploring expedition in distant countries 
during this expedition he had been almost constantly in peril of his life 
almost every night he had had to stay awake and watch so as not to be set
upon and killed   he had been back in england a short time and had
completely recovered from the privations and sufferings he had experienced 
but he suffered desperately from insomnia   on his return he had slept well 
but a month before his sleep had suddenly begun to be disturbed 

knowing me to be a neurologist  he asked my advice  i inquired about the
patient s former life  but discovered that my traveling companion was little
inclined to be communicative in this direction  in fact he was strikingly
reticent  to my inquiry about the immediate origin of the insomnia  he told
me it was immediately connected with a miserable dream which he had dreamt a
month past  and from which he had awakened in terrible anxiety   i asked him
to tell me this dream and gave him hope that perhaps the analysis of this
might succeed in laying bare the cause of the insomnia  the substance of the
dream was as follows 

 i was in a narrow gorge  formed by almost perpendicular walls of rock  this
made me think of a similar narrow gorge which  during my journey  i had
passed through at peril of my life   upon a jutting rock a hundred yards
high above the abyss  i saw a man and woman standing  shoulder to shoulder 
both covering their eyes with their hands  they step forward and i see them
plunge downwards together  and hear their bodies falling to destruction 
screaming wildly i awoke   since that time i dare not let myself sleep for
fear of the repetition of this dream 

the patient  accustomed to deadly peril on his long expedition  could not
explain to himself the anxiety caused by this dream  i called mr  x s
attention to the fact that in my opinion an erotic conflict was concealed in
the dream  and asked him point blank whether he had taken part in a love
story  at this the patient grew deadly pale  struck the table with his fist
and said  that you should have guessed it   now the confession followed  how
he had had a love affair in which he had not cut a good figure and which
ruined a woman s life  and that afterwards he had been violently remorseful
and had lived with the idea of suicide   then he had seized upon the
opportunity offered him to lead a dangerous expedition  he wanted to die and
here he would not find death ingloriously 

it is clear that the two people upon the rocks above symbolized the two  who
went to meet destruction 

soon afterwards the travelers parted   a year later the newspapers contained
the report of the marriage of the famous explorer  the surmise is allowable
that the analysis of this dream was the cause of this fortunate solution 

as i have already pointed out  the original cathartic method of breuer and
freud  explained to some extent  is still followed by some investigators  by
muthman  bezzola  frank and many others  i had the opportunity in june and
july  1912  of observing for some time the treatment of patients by dr 
frank in zurich at his private clinic  and of gaining for myself a
satisfactory idea of his technique  frank by no means rejects the freudian
psychoanalysis with all its helps  but uses it only when he does not succeed
in hypnotizing his patient  preferably  and in a great number of cases  he
uses  in a state of hypnotism  a cathartic method he originated 

where breuer and freud profited from the spontaneous or the provoked
somnabulistic state of the patient  and by questioning dug up the hidden
depths  frank decided to be satisfied with a light hypnose  a state of
hypotaxie  which might be termed analogous to the half conscious state of
the person who after taking a mid day nap frequently denies having been
asleep   in this condition we can give an account on waking of what happened
around us  one sleeps and one does not sleep  the upper consciousness then
can control what the sub consciousness brings up 

frank says that  except in the peculiarity that he is satisfied with a
lighter degree of hypnose  his method differs from that of breuer and freud
in that generally he does not question the patient when under hypnotism 
neither suggests   experience has taught him  he says  that the ideas loaded
with affect  spontaneously discharge  they are the very ones which would do
so in a dream  but are differentiated from the occurrences in the dream in
the sense that these last enter phantastically dressed  while the first
express themselves with the mental affects belonging to them  precisely as
they were lived through 

precisely as in the primitive cathartic method  the affects pushing in here
are disemburdened here  but at the same time  the connection between the
existent sick phenomena and the causes having a place here were
automatically conscious to the patient  in some cases suggestion is called
upon for help in order to free an affect or to direct the attention to the
expected scene 

in most cases the process goes on itself  after the introduction of
hypnosis  if the sleep is too deep  then the ideas are transferred into real
dreams  which the patient immediately recognizes as such  or the production
of scenes discontinues  the superconsciousness no longer works 

the scenes described are usually recalled by the patients  just as they were
experienced by them  even when taken from the earliest youth   the reality
of the events which happened in childhood  lived over again in hypnose  are
substantiated as much as possible by the patient s parents or associates  he
succeeds best in inducing this semi sleep by exhorting the patient as he
closes his eyes not to bother about whether he sleeps or not  but to fasten
his attention upon the scenes which are about to present themselves  that
is  to think himself  so to speak  into the state of someone at a moving
picture show 

as an example i give a fragment of a frankian analysis of a case of

fear neurosis  angst neurose 

y  b   born 1883  a law clerk   patient comes on the third of december 
1908  to frank s consultation hour  he complains of periods of short breath 
during these he feels as if his heart were ceasing to beat  especially when
he is just going to bed  he feels then as if something heavy were striking
him on the chest  great restlessness  and a feeling of faintness comes over
him  after taking a glass of wine the condition is aggravated and becomes
insupportable   these attacks come once or twice a day  mostly in the
evenings   at times they keep off for eight or ten days  he lives
continually in an excited state  he suffers from palpitations of the heart 
from pain in the left thigh  pain in the left side  and at night cannot get
to sleep 

patient attributes this condition to an automobile accident which happened
to him on june 2  1908   even before this accident he had been a trifle
nervous on account of overwork   in the automobile accident he had been
thrown out  and had been thrown a distance of ten or fifteen yards  the
automobile  which was at high speed  had also plunged down the decline  but
luckily the patient was not caught directly under the machine   he did not
lose consciousness  and escaped with some scratches and a bad fright  it was
a marvel that he and the chauffeur escaped with their lives  he plainly
recalls thinking  during the fall  that his last hour had come  and even yet
is amazed how extremely untroubled he had been by that thought  the days
following the accident he felt as if his face were burning  and he was
inwardly agitated whenever he thought of an automobile  on june 30  1908  he
was obliged to take a business journey  while seated in the station
restaurant it suddenly grew dark before his eyes  he could breathe only with
difficulty  his heartbeats were irregular and he had a strange sensation of
fear   this condition lasted the whole day  on the return journey his train
ran into an automobile truck  the patient was thrown to the floor of the
coupe by the shock  this incident made a great impression upon him 
nevertheless  for eight days he was free from the uneasiness already
described   after that an attack of fear again set in  continuing at
intervals  with periods of greater or lesser violence  until the present 

december 7  1908   a first attempt to induce hypnosis was successful 

december 8  1908   patient goes to sleep immediately  becomes frightened and
gives frequent signs of terror  when awakened  he mentioned that he had had
a feeling as if he were falling into a hole  that had given him a very
strange sensation   the patient speaks while he sleeps  his
super consciousness therefore remains awake and is able to take notice
directly of the scene taking place  after some minutes he sees in the
hypnosis a locomotive approaching  he cries out   there it comes out of the
tunnel   he is afraid of being run over  and is terrified  two years
previously he had been through this scene  he was standing on the track when
a train approached  and he was afraid of being run over   in his sleep  the
patient communicates the details and sees everything clearly  after a short
interval of complete rest  he begins to breathe heavily  his pulse quickens 
then he cries out in fright and excitement and dread   now it s coming  now
the auto s coming  it s turning over  we re under it  there it s riding over
us   gradually he quiets down again  and after a quarter of an hour  awakes 
he says he now feels something lifted from his chest  that he has slept
well  and feels better  he recalls everything   the train came out of the
tunnel with gleaming lights  this scene took place in the evening  the
automobile scene was reproduced precisely as he had taken part in it  no
detail escaped him  his breathing is unobstructed now  and he has no more
heart palpitations 

on the day appointed for the seance i was unexpectedly obliged to go away 
when i wished to resume the treatment  january 9  the patient wrote me that
his condition was strikingly improved  the heart palpitations and feelings
of anxiety had not reappeared  his pleasure in life and work had returned
once more  his night s rest left nothing to be desired  his appetite was
excellent  therefore he thought that further treatment was not necessary for
the present  to a later inquiry  february 12  1910  a year afterwards  i
obtained this answer    without exaggeration i am able to write you that in
my whole life i have never felt so well as now  there has been no question
of any nervous attacks or feelings of dread  my weight  which had gone down
to fifty eight kilos during my nervous sickness  has gone up to seventy
kilos  

when frank shuts himself up with his patients in a room  from which all
outer noises are excluded as much as possible  by means of double windows
and doors  although he  by means of electric light signals visible to him
alone  keeps in touch with the servant outside  he has the patient recline
as comfortably as possible upon a low sofa  he kneels on a cushion at the
head  bends down over the patient and has the latter look upwards directly
into his eyes  meanwhile he lets his left hand rest upon the patient s
forehead and gently presses the latter s eyelids with his thumb and
forefinger  as soon as the patient shows signs of weariness  he carefully
gets up  takes a seat next to the patient and continues carefully observant
of the latter s behavior and expression of countenance  he makes note of
everything that shows itself and rouses the patient after about a quarter of
an hour  unless the latter awakes spontaneously  now he talks over with him
the material which has been procured and then has the patient go into a
renewed hypnosis  until the end of an hour  sometimes the seances are
protracted when important scenes come up  and in the interest of the
treatment it might be lengthened to two or even three hours 

bezzola makes use of a small  light  black silk mask  which he puts on the
eyes of the patient   he induces hypnosis  and for the rest follows frank s
technique already described 

while analysts who avail themselves of hypnosis as a means of help have all
their patients take a reclining position  those who have given up hypnotism
in their treatment  have also given up this reclining position  freud
continues to prefer having the patient assume a reclining position  and
takes his position with his back to the patient  behind the head of the
sofa  he considers that this manner of treatment induces the greatest
calmness in the patient and makes it easier for him to express himself and
to confess  he keeps as quiet as possible  listens with undivided attention 
does not take any notes during the seance  not wishing to give rise to the
suspicion that all the confession will be written down and perhaps seen by
other eyes 

jung receives the patient in his study just as he would receive any ordinary
visitor   he thinks that in this way the patient is put most at his ease and
that it makes him feel he is not considered as a patient  but rather as some
one who  being in difficulties  comes to ask advice and needs to tell his
troubles to a trusted friend  even less than freud does he take notes in the
presence of the patient 

stekel does as jung  the only difference being that he remains seated at his
writing table and makes notes of the most important points 

the most satisfactory way for the uninitiated to make himself familiar with
the technique of psychoanalysis is to submit himself to psychoanalysis  for
that purpose one turns to an experienced analyst  and takes to him one s
ideas and dreams   consequently i submitted myself for two months to
analysis from dr  jung  who in that way initiated me into the practice of
psychological investigation   the interpretation of one s own dreams 
reading and studying of the principal literature about analytical psychology
or deep psychology  as bleuler calls it  and the application of what is thus
learned  at the start to simple  later to more difficult cases  must do the
rest in making an independent investigator in this branch of psycho therapy 

as has already been said  psychoanalysis aims at bringing into consciousness
all the forgotten things   when all the gaps in the memory are filled in 
when all the puzzling operations of the psychological life are explained 
then the continuance and the return of the suffering has become impossible 
the attainment of this ideal state is truly the attainment of utopia   most
certainly a treatment does not need to be carried so far  one may be
satisfied with the practical cure of the patient  with the restoration of
his power for work  and with the abolition of the most difficult functional
disturbances 

it is applicable in cases of chronic psychoneurosis which exhibit no
difficult or dangerous phenomena  among these are counted all sorts of
compulsive neuroses  compulsive thoughts  compulsive behavior and cases of
hysteria  where phobias and obsessions play a chief role  also somatic
phenomena of hysteria which do not need to be acted upon quickly  such as 
for example  anorexia   in acute cases of hysteria it is better to wait for
a calmer period before applying psychoanalysis  in cases of nervous
prostration this manner of treatment  which demands the serious co operation
and attention of the patient  which lasts a long time and at first takes no
notice of the continuance of the phenomena  is difficult   this form of
psychotherapy places great demands on the physician s patience and
understanding  psychoanalyses which last more than a year  are no rarity  it
cannot be applied to the seriously degenerated  to people who have passed
far beyond middle life  because among the last named the accumulated
material compasses too much  to those who are entangled in a state of great
fear and who live in deep depression  analysis can be applied to the
neuroses of children   it is desirable in those cases for the physician to
be supported by a trusted person  as for example a woman assistant  but
preferably by parents enlightened sufficiently to observe the spontaneous
remarks of the child  to make notes of them  and communicate them to the
physician  according to the experiments undertaken by the zurich school  the
expectation is justified within certain limits  that psychoanalysis will be
therapeutically useful in certain forms of paranoia and dementia praecox 

i think that it will soon be said of psychoanalysis  as of so many other
systems which like it were decried and yet later were highly valued  that
the enemies of to day are the friends of to morrow 

whoever wishes to judge freud must take the trouble to initiate himself
seriously into his doctrines  and use his methods for a long time in
practice  according to his instructions 

most of the condemnations are brought forward by investigators who judge a
priori  without acquaintance with the facts  upon uncertain theoretical
grounds and with prepossession against his sexual theory 

whoever initiates himself seriously into the practice of psychoanalysis 
will arrive at the conclusion that this new form of psychical curing
deserves  to a great degree  the attention of the physician and that it may
be considered as an enrichment of the armory of the psychotherapy  not yet
sufficiently valued 

does it render other forms of psychotherapy superfluous  there can be no
thought of that 

taking the pros and cons given here  we see that each of the forms of
psychical therapy deserves in its turn preference  and that all support and
complement each other 

jung  as well as freud  both of whom have made their life s aim the
perfection of psychoanalysis  and who for that reason now concern themselves
exclusively with it  appreciate all forms of verbal treatment  as well with
hypnotism as without it  hypnotic suggestion and suggestion given when awake
was used at an earlier period by both of them with good results  and they
still are not averse to using this method where quick comprehension and the
immediate subdual of a troublesome symptom is desired 

the psychoanalyst follows the longer road  and assails rather the root of
the sickness  it works more radically  hypnotic treatment takes hold quicker
and is directed at the symptoms 

freud explains it in this manner   when one treats the patient by hypnotic
suggestion  one introduces a new idea from outside in exchange for the
morbid idea  if psychoanalysis is applied  then one simply eliminates the
morbid idea  within certain limits the modus agendi of the two methods is in
absolute opposition 

the suggestion method  substituting one idea for another  puts in something 
the analytical  expelling an idea  takes out something  both aim at and
obtain the same end  a more or less lasting cure  suggestion neutralizes 
stops the poison  analysis expels the harmful matter  the latter manner of
treatment is positive and the most decisive 

 don t we all analyze    bernheim inquires  and once more i agree that all
forms of psychotherapeutics do  but there is a difference in analysis 

superficial analysis can bring us a long way toward the goal  in many cases
it may suffice   but the profound  the freudian analysis  is what we need if
we wish to attain the radical cure of psychoneurosis  as far as we can ever
speak of a radical cure  many cases of illness do not lend themselves to
deep analysis 

when  because of the nature of the illness  or the lifetime  or the feeble
intelligence of the patient  or because of temporary circumstances of a
moral or material nature  its adaptation is excluded or impossible  it is
advisable  especially in chronic cases   to take refuge in the more
palliative forms of the psychic methods of cure 

thus the psychotherapeutic as moral leader fills the role of guide
 directeur d ames   one who helps along the doubter  encourages the toilers 
calms the frightened  arouses courage  keeps up hope and comforts where
comfort is needed 

pierre janet  in his instructive book   obsessions et idees fixes   
observes that one of his chronic patients gave him the pet name of  le
remonteur de pendules   an expression which luminously describes the role of
the physician of souls  who  tirelessly  day in  day out  lifts the burdens 
and for a time breathes new life into the depressed 

hypnotic suggestion  which induces sleep  stills pain  silences fear 
abolishes functional disturbances  works chiefly palliatively  the place for
its application is where quick comprehension is desired  in its simplest
form it resembles the treatment of a mother  who soothes her child with
pacifying words and loving touch  and rocks him to sleep  and also it
resembles the behavior of the father  who asserts his authority by force and
breaks down the childish opposition   we find hypnotic suggestion  perfected
and clothed in its scientific garment  in liebeault s assertion   it is a
cure of authority  of faith  of confidence  a cure which frequently performs
semi miracles  respect on one side  sympathy on the other  is what gives the
hypnotiser results  

however highly we may value this last mentioned form of therapy  however
numerous the cures due to it may be  however indispensable it may be in the
practice of medicine  yet its splendor pales before the light which shines
forth from the cures which aim at reeducation and which are directed toward
the understanding  those are the cures which make use of analysis 

one method  which we will call the superficial analytical method  is
directed exclusively toward the upper consciousness and cures principally
through exhorting  convincing  exercising and hardening  its sponsors are
bernheim  rosenbach  p  e  levy  dubois   at least it is true to its birth 
it has suggestion blood in its veins 

the other method is the deeper   the freudian analysis  this does not allow
itself to be satisfied with seeing only one side of the medal  it does not
limit its field of activity to the superliminal consciousness  in searching
for the causes of psychogenic illnesses  but it penetrates into the strata
which lie hidden under the threshold of the consciousness 

where the moral and the suggestive methods of cure are limited exclusively
to symptomatic treatment  the first form of educative therapy  limited
merely to a superficial analysis  is only partly symptomatic  but the second
form of educative therapy penetrates with its deep going analysis to the
root of the trouble  and has as its aim a fundamental cure 

only too frequently the physician must be satisfied with the cure of the
symptoms  with lightening the load  he always strives to remove the cause 
freud s great service is that he has opened before the physician a path
which leads to the cause 

these lines of vondel s seem as if composed for him 

  the physician must not only know  how high the pulse has mounted   and
where the sickness lies  which makes him groan with pain   but he must see
the cause  from where  the great weakness of this sickness came

an elementary study of the brain  based on the dissection of the brain of
the sheep   by eben w  fiske  a m   m d  illustrated with photographs and
diagrams by the author   the macmillan company  new   york  1913 

the study of the brain is confessedly a difficult subject  and particularly
so for the elementary student  there is certainly no royal road to its
conquest  but this is an added reason why an introduction to its study
should be made as simple as the subject permits  and also as interesting 
dr  fiske has attempted this task in this book  which he entitles  an
elementary study of the brain    the brain of the sheep is chosen as the
basis of study because of its availability  its relative simplicity of
structure  and its essential similarity to that of man   it appears to the
author  and we think with justice  that the subject should be approached
from a biological standpoint  hence  throughout the book  there is constant
reference to the evolution of nervous structure and to fundamental
conceptions of a biological character  further than this  the relations of
cerebral anatomy and function  together with allied psychological
considerations  demand continual reference as a supplement to purely
anatomical considerations  the secret of exciting interest in any anatomical
study surely lies in a consideration of the function of the organ or
structure in relation to its anatomical form   bare descriptions cannot and
should not inspire interest  whereas the driest anatomical facts  if seen in
their broader relationships  at once assume a significance in the student s
mind which may be attained in no other way 

the first chapter is a brief statement of phylogeny  followed  as are
succeeding chapters  by directions to the student regarding means of study 
the second chapter concerns itself with ontogeny  and the student is wisely
advised to make drawings of various stages in the development of the brain
of one of the higher mammals  an actual brain is always to be preferred to a
model   the third chapter gives directions of a simple and practical sort as
to methods of removing the sheep s brain   thereafter  chapters follow 
descriptive of the various surfaces of the brain  of sagital  horizontal and
transverse sections  and of certain of the internal structures and the brain
stem 

a summary concludes the volume  and a very brief but well selected
bibliography   the illustrations are thoroughly adequate  the excellent
method being used of photographic reproductions  with accompanying
descriptive plates done in outline  in general  the book  modest though it
is  should prove a most admirable laboratory guide  not only for students of
zoology  but also for those who propose  as physicians  to make a final
study of the human brain   it is  no doubt  more difficult to write an
acceptable elementary text book than a more complete treatise  but the
author  we have no hesitation in saying  has succeeded in this object  and
has added a book of positive value to the long list which has gone before 
the bna nomenclature has been adopted in part  but by no means to the
exclusion of the old terminology  which is certainly a far more efficient
means of introducing an ultimate uniform nomenclature than an immediate
complete change to the bna system  the text is well printed and readable 
and the proof reading in general good   we note  however  on page 86  that
the name von gudden is spelled with one d instead of two  e  w  taylor 



the backward child  a study of the psychology of backwardness  a practical
manual for teachers and students   by barbara spoffard morgan  g  p 
putnam s sons  new york  1914   pp   xvii plus 263 

this book by mrs  morgan  which is somewhat unique and certainly very
different from other books on the same subject  promises to be one of the
most widely read educational works which has recently appeared  it is based
on two years  experience in an experimental clinic for backward children in
new york city and the author states that   it is an effort to persuade
teachers and parents  in spite of a hide bound educational system  to study
the children that interest them as individuals and to recognize their
faculties and tendencies   it  looks to a future when teachers will so
understand every child s mental structure that his whole education will be
directed to the fortifying of his weak points and the development of his
tendencies  

the author terms her process  mental analysis  and says it differs from the
binet and simon tests in that they are merely to classify children  and her
method discovers peculiarities and also gives the training necessary to
bring the child up to normal   she gives a psychological basis for her work
which will be surprising to many readers because of its great divergence
from the usual psychological treatment  the child s mind is considered as
having four primary processes  namely   1  sense impressions   2 
recollections of sense impressions   3  association channels  4  abstraction
processes   as the child grows older these are elaborated into imagination 
reasoning  and expression  attention is of three kinds    1  homogeneous
attention or concentrating  which consists in attending to one thing for a
period of time   2  simultaneous attention or observing  which consists in
giving attention to a number of things at once  and  3  disparate attention 
or giving attention to two or more things over a period of time  memory may
be  1  automatic   2  voluntary  or  3  retentive   the function of the
tests is to determine just which one of these processes are weak or strong
and discover a method of education which is suited to the individual  other
mental processes  such as sensation  perception  abstraction  and judgment
are discussed  and an interesting treatment distinguishing between the
analytic and synthetic type of mind is given 

one of the most important parts of the book is the discussion of the way in
which the tests are given  she insists that the relation of the child and
the examiner be very personal and informal and that the process be varied as
much as possible in order to prevent crystallization  many of the tests are
the same  or much the same  as those of simon and binet  but the greatest of
liberty is taken in adapting them to the particular case   much use is made
of conversation  puzzle pictures and other little friendly means by which
the personal characteristics of the child may be learned  after this is
done  the proper training of the child is to be selected and the effort made
to bring him back to normality  for which purpose  some quaint and
interesting devices are used  one case given is that of a little girl whose
senses of sound and form were defective and who therefore could not learn
her letters  these letters were pasted on the keys of a piano and she was
taught to play a piece with one finger  meanwhile chanting over the names of
the letters as they were struck  in this way her sense of sound was trained 
she learned her letters and gained ability to learn more and faster 
abstraction may be strengthened by having the child measure distances with a
rule  first calculating the distance with his eye  the power of association
may be made stronger by having the individual sort words or pictures which
are pasted on slips of cardboard  he is to arrange them according to meaning
or according to the activities with which they have to do  simultaneous
attention may be trained by such games as  hide the thimble  or jack straws 
and homogeneous attention may be trained by some such action as hammering
nails in the upper left hand corners of all the squares on a board 
imagination is developed by retelling stories  and invention by solving
puzzles  voluntary memory is strengthened by writing original rhymes and
automatic memory may be strengthened by having the child write out a list of
all the things in his kitchen or any other room with which he may happen to
be familiar 

different types of backward children are described and a few pages are
devoted to a discussion of hysteria 

it is a book which will  in all probability  arouse considerable discussion
and which will find some warm friends and some determined enemies  as one
more publication calling attention to this important problem  it is of great
value and it will probably be read more widely than any other book in this
field which has appeared   perhaps its greatest practical value lies in its
suggestiveness as to the ways in which one may use his personality and
initiative in dealing with backward children  rather than sticking so
closely to prescribed tests and methods

continuity   the presidential address to the british association for 1913 
by sir oliver lodge   g  p  putnam s sons  new york and london  1914   pp 
v  131 

the most obvious particular wisdom of the present scientific period is
undoubtedly just that concept denoted by the title of this volume 
continuity   and this wisdom is advanced wisdom and  withal  wisdom which is
very expedient and even indispensable at this day  as a reaction required to
set right the over specialization of recent minds thoughtful only of some
little branch of knowledge  just in proportion as one esteems  authority 
will one give heed to the pronouncement of the presidential address before
the british association  yet for its own intrinsic sake it is a piece of
work which cannot be ignored 

interesting and revolutionary as are the recent additions to philosophical
physics brought about by the discovery of radium and its like  it is the
other phase of this great physicist s mental trend which particularly
interests the student of human behavior   that wisdom which gives him  as it
gave william james  and for a like reason   the bravery to look a bit beyond
the more or less materialistic confines of mere science into the broader
realm  and strange  is it not  that a man need be brave in this twentieth
century domini to discuss spiritism and survival and telepathy  only those
do it who cannot  lose their jobs    can one indeed honestly doubt that many
an intelligent psychologist to day is kept from investigating this pressing
phase of knowledge largely  or even solely  by the materialistic incubus
whose continuance still stands for an academic salary usually sufficient to
buy wife and children bread  if not a little meat 

 material bodies are all that we have any control over  are all that we are
experimentally aware of  anything that we can do with these is open to us 
any conclusions we can draw about them may be legitimate and true  but to
step outside their province and to deny the existence of any other region
because we have no sense organs for its appreciation  or because  like the
ether  it is too uniformly omnipresent for our ken  is to wrest our
advantages and privileges from their proper use and apply them to our own
misdirection          i am one of those who think that the methods of
science are not so limited in their scope as has been thought  that they can
be applied much more widely  and that the psychic region can be studied and
brought under law too   allow us anyhow to make the attempt  give us a fair
field   let those who prefer the materialistic hypothesis by all means
develop their thesis as far as they can  but let us try what we can do in
the psychical region  and see which wins  our methods are really the same as
theirs  the subject matter differs  neither should abuse the other for
making the attempt  

here is this matter in a nutshell  and the evolution of cosmology in the
last few years makes this argument and this plea greatly more persuasive
still  for it forges one more link in the actual knowledge of continuity 

twenty four pages of useful  explanatory notes follow in this volume  the
text of the address   the book lacks an index  to those sapient ones who
have not already saved the important little work out of science  the dollar
which this volume costs is a dollar well spent  unless  indeed  philosophy
be to him but a reproach   george v  n  dearborn   tufts medical and dental

adventurings in the psychical   by h  addington bruce   little  brown   co  
1914 

professor flournoy  in the preface to his spiritism and psychology  made the
remark    it will be a great day when the subliminal psychology of myers and
his followers  and the abnormal psychology of freud and his school  succeed
in meeting  and will supplement and complete one another  that will be a
great forward step in science and in the understanding of our nature  
 page vi  

any one who attacks the problem from this standpoint  in the right manner 
is to be commended  and this is  very largely  the method of attack taken by
a certain group of  psychical researches   it is also the method of approach
of mr  bruce  in the book under review   although it will probably contain
but little new to the student of abnormal psychology  it is  nevertheless  a
welcome and extremely sane presentation of the problems discussed  while 
for the general public  the effect of the book cannot be other than
beneficial    giving a sound and scientific view point of many of these
obscure and outlying problems 

much of this book will be familiar to readers of the journal   the chapters
on the  subconscious   extended and amplified in his final chapter on  the
larger self     dissociation and disease   and  the singular case of b  c 
a    contain a summary of material long familiar to general psychological
students  though this data has not been sufficiently popularized as
yet   while the case of b  c  a  is a relief after the oft quoted earlier
cases 

the first chapter   ghosts and their meaning   deals with apparitions of the
living  of the dying  and of the dead  according to the tentative
arrangement of these cases made by the english s  p  r  most of these are
quoted from the society s proceedings  and the usual theories are offered to
account for them  in the case of apparitions of the dead  e  g    ghosts  
the theory of deferred telepathic suggestion being held  this brings us
naturally to the second chapter   why i believe in telepathy   which again
contains a summary of much of the s  p  r  work in this field  accompanied 
however  by some other cases and a few interesting incidents which fell
under the author s personal observation   the next two chapters deal with
 clairvoyance and crystal gazing  and  automatic speaking and writing 
respectively   here  again  the bulk of the material is familiar to
psychical and psychological students  though it must be admitted that this
material is all excellently and carefully summarized  the author s attitude 
throughout  is strictly critical and scientific  and while he believes in
telepathy and other supernormal powers  he rejects spiritism as an
explanation  and his views throughout are temperate and modest 

the remaining chapter  dealing as it does with  poltergeists and mediums  
takes us into the more dubious field of  physical phenomena   spontaneous
and experimental  and cases are discussed which lie outside the province of
the psychologist    since they entrench more upon the domain of physics and
biology  as such they have been treated and discussed by the majority of
continental savants 

one word more regarding the famous medium  eusapia palladino  whom mr  bruce
refers to in several passages in this chapter  referring to her in a
footnote on page 196  as  the discredited eusapia palladino  once the marvel
of two continents   may i take this occasion to repeat here what i have
often repeated in public and private  elsewhere  and that is  that i retain
my unshaken belief  amounting to a conviction  in the genuineness of
eusapia s power  and that  despite the trickery which was undoubtedly
discovered here  and which had also been discovered  i may add  more than
twenty years before she ever came to this country  she yet possesses
genuine  remarkable powers of a supernormal character  and this belief  i
may say  is shared equally by all the continental investigators  who remain
unaffected by the so called american expose  a statement of their attitude
is perhaps well summarized by flournoy  in his spiritism and psychology
 chap  vii   while i have published the records of the american seances  
for those who may be interested  in my  personal experiences in
spiritualism   where copious extracts from the shorthand notes of the
american sittings are given 

to return  however   if there is a criticism to make of mr  bruce s book  it
is that it displays a lack of personal investigation and experimentation 
and bears throughout the ear marks of a literary compilation   but this is 
after all  not a serious detraction from a work of this character   which
is  as i have said before  excellently done   hereward carrington

d hospice   g  steinheil  editeur  paris  1913  pp   x 449 

the author in this volume has written a clinical and medico legal treatise
on traumatic nervous affections from a broad and philosophical standpoint 
the subject is treated under the following headings    generalities   in
which is discussed the historical development of our knowledge of the
effects of traumatism  the etiology  the evolution of the various
disturbances  and the legal side of the questions at issue 

following this introduction  under chapter i  the general topic of what the
writer terms the traumatic dysthenias or the traumatic sthenopathies is
discussed under the following subheadings   a  simple post traumatic
asthenia   b  post traumatic astheno mania   c  prolonged asthenia and
chronic traumatic asthenia  under which he includes traumatic neurasthenia 
traumatic hystero neurasthenia  traumatic neurosis  and traumatic
psychoneurosis   d  chronic post traumatic mania   e  periodic
post traumatic dysthenias   f  asthenic mania and pathological anatomy 
chapter ii  under the general heading   traumatic dysthymias   a  anxiety
post traumatic hyperthymia   b  traumatic hypochondriasis and traumatic
hysteria   c  special hyperthymia of accidents   d  hysterical and traumatic
crises   e  prolonged or permanent post traumatic disturbances of character
in children and adults  chapter iii  under the general heading   traumatic
dysthymias    a  traumatic amnesia   b  post traumatic korsakoff syndrome 
 c  traumatic mental confusion   d  post traumatic agnosia   e 
post traumatic dementias   f  systematized chronic post traumatic deliriums 
chapter iv  under the general heading   psychic states and diverse
post traumatic neuroses    a  post traumatic epilepsy   b  traumatic
aphasia   c  alcoholism  traumatism and hallucinatory conditions   d 
post traumatic sensual perversions   e  pains  vertigos  deafness  etc  
following trauma   f  distant post traumatic psychic disorders with cerebral
lesions   g  unclassifiable observations   to this comprehensive material is
added an appendix on the topic of psychic and neurotic disturbances as
indications for trephining 

this outline of the contents of the book  which contains in addition many
subheadings  gives a sufficiently clear idea of its scope and of the pains
which the author has taken to subdivide his subject matter to the last
possible degree  whether such a detailed classification has merit sufficient
to justify its complexity must be left to the individual reader to
determine   it may  however  with justice be said that the author has spared
no pains to illustrate by case reports the various phases of traumatic
disorder which he enumerates  he has a keen sense of the significance of
psychiatric knowledge in a proper understanding of the various results of
trauma  and lays special stress upon the breadth of the psychiatric field 
under which he properly enough includes the various so called psychoneuroses
as well as epilepsy  tics and aphasia  he believes that one may only arrive
at a diagnostic criterion of such affections through the sensations and
emotions expressed by the patients   the somatic phenomena he regards as
always subordinate and accessory   under this point of view  he attacks his
problem  and with considerable success an admirable brief historical review
of traumatism in relation to the nervous system constitutes a valuable
section of the book  in which he brings out the conflicting views which have
prevailed since the earlier work of erichsen down through the fundamental
investigations of westphal  charcot  knapp  oppenheim and others 

the author finds fault with the common use of the word traumatism in the
sense of trauma  and correctly draws attention to the fact that traumatism
should express a general condition  whereas  trauma should be used as
indicative of a local lesion   this distinction has been too often
overlooked  with resulting confusion 

in general  the book represents a vast amount of painstaking thought and an
earnest but somewhat confusing attempt to bring light into the somewhat dark
places of a much discussed subject  which has frequently been the source of
more or less acrimonious discussion  not the least significant part of the
volume is the constant reference to the legal implications of the traumatic
affections  it should therefore be useful  not only to the physician  but
also to the legal profession   it will doubtless be used rather as a book of
reference than as a readable treatise  e  w  taylor

with a better understanding of psychopathic phenomena  the underlying
psychology of criminology becomes more clearly defined  maladjustment may
express itself in an insane outbreak  criminal act  or in an anti social
deed  indeed  in all of them the underlying phenomenon is a psychopathic
condition which comes under the realm of abnormal psychology   the large
group of criminals should not be looked upon as a homogenous class  but the
individuality of criminal and the type of the delinquent act in reaction to
his heredity  mental make up and environmental influences should be fully
considered  herein lies the great value of wetzel s and willmann s
monograph  these authors report three cases in which criminal acts were
attributed to abnormal mental life 

the first case was that of a young man of twenty three  who showed a
psychopathic personality with tainted heredity on the paternal side  he was
subject to convulsive attacks  which were regarded as hysterical and not
epileptic   in his intelligence he was above the average  he was engaged to
a young woman  and because she refused to marry him  he at first
contemplated to take his life  but later shot at her three times without
injuring her  and then made an unsuccessful attempt at suicide  his
delinquent act was determined not only by his environment  but also by his
peculiar type of personality  which was taken into consideration by the
court  and on this ground he was acquitted 

in the second case  a young man of twenty shot his fiancee through the
temporal region  injuring her severely  soon after committing this act he
surrendered himself to the police  he also showed striking evidences of a
psychopathic personality with a strong suggestion of epilepsy  but with
intact intelligence  he was given to periods of depression and was unstable
mentally  he was easily suggestible and his general conduct was not only
controlled by environmental influences  but also by his mood  suicidal ideas
and jealousy played a very important role in his mental life  especially
they were marked when he began to keep company with the young woman 
although his abnormal constitution was taken into account  nevertheless he
was punished by one year s imprisonment  during confinement he attempted
suicide  but was unsuccessful  some time after his release he committed
suicide  the cause of which he assigned to an abortion that was induced by
his sweetheart 

the third case is very interesting and rather intricate  by reason of the
fact that murder or double suicide was suspected  the following are the
details of this case   a young man of eighteen kept company with a young
woman about the same age  from another town  the girls of the town were
jealous of her and began to gossip about her to the extent of casting
aspersions upon her character  etc  the young man s father  without
investigating this case  forbade his son to marry her   however  the two
lovers would have frequent secret rendezvous  and his fiancee became
depressed over this scandalous and groundless rumor and also because of the
peculiar attitude her young man s father assumed  one evening the young man
returned home late  and upon confessing to his father of his secret meetings
with his fiancee  he was severely beaten and prohibited to see her again 

a few days later the young man wrote a letter to his sweetheart  telling her
of his father s emphatic determinations  but soon they met again and she
suggested that they should die together on account of this gossip that was
circulated about her  a day following this meeting both of them were missed 
and after some search the young woman was found lying on the ground with two
shots in her head and one in the breast  and the young man was hanging from
a tree  in a near by wood  the latter was resuscitated  but the former was
dead  it is interesting to note that the autopsy showed that death in her
case was due to strangulation and not to the bullets  this young man was
endowed with a psychopathic personality  and there was a history of short
attacks of depression  he received several head traumata and suffered from
enuresis in his early life 

following the resuscitation  he grew confused and excited  and within
twenty four hours he recovered from the acute episode but showed incomplete
amnesia for his act   he stated that he remembered firing the shots  but had
no remembrance of strangulating her  soon after this he passed into a
peculiar state of confusion  in addition  fabrications and retention defect
were also demonstrated  the cerebrospinal fluid revealed some abnormal
changes which were suggestive of an organic brain disease   the wassermann
test was negative   finally  he made a complete recovery except for the
incomplete amnesia 

since the death of the young woman was caused by strangulation  the question
had to be decided whether he was the cause of her death or she died as the
result of her own hand   the court favored suicide  and held that the bodily
injury was inflicted with the pistol by the young man  he received a lenient
sentence  only nine months imprisonment  in this case  the type of his
personality  and all the circumstances that led to the development of the
act were taken into consideration 

although the authors presented this subject purely objectively  yet their
studies are extremely interesting and important  and show conclusively the
importance of psychopathological methods in criminology   one who is
interested in this subject will find this monograph of great value and help 
it may also be added that the authors give a complete list of the casuistic
literature of the murder among lovers  morris j  karpas 



development and purpose   an essay towards a philosophy of evolution  by l 
t  hobhouse  martin white professor of sociology in the university of
london   macmillan   co   london   1913  pp   xxix  383 

 development and purpose  is essentially the complement of professor
hobhouse s well known and valuable  mind in evolution   published in 1901 
if it were rather a continuation than the complement  many would be pleased 
for the exposition already made practically guarantees a rich application 
were it undertaken  to matters still further  away  in the realm of thought 
the present volume lacks the multitude of scientific data and references
which make  mind in evolution  so important for the study of psychology  as
behavior or not as behavior  as the reader pleases   but it contains in
their space many timely discussions  in some cases seemingly prophetic  of
teleology in its relation to evolution 

the seventeen chapters of the book  there is also an extremely thoughtful
introduction and a full index   are divided into two parts  one entitled
 lines of development  and the other  the conditions of development    the
reviewer s lazy cortex  and possibly those of other and more leisurely
readers  is made glad by a complete chapter synopsis or syllabus  occupying
seven pages   so much of the whole treatise is suggested in the synopsis of
the first three chapters that it is well to give them in full  as follows 

 i  the nature and the significance of mental evolution   1  the biological
view regards mind as an organ evolved to adapt behavior to the environment 
 2  and tends to reduce its action to a mechanical process    3  parallelism
in the end reduces mind to an epi phenomenon  an important undoubted fact
which has been often ignored by what are left of the parallelists    4  the
object of comparative psychology is to determine empirically the actual
function of mind in successive stages of development   5  it involves a
social as well as an individual psychology   6  the statement of the higher
phases also opens up philosophical questions   7  and on the solution of
these depends the final interpretation of the recorded movement 

 ii   the structure of mind    1  mental operations are known in the first
instance as objects of consciousness   2  mind is the permanent unity
including consciousness and the sum of processes continuous with
consciousness and determining it   3  these processes involve  but are not
identical with physical processes  constituting with them a psychophysical
unity 

 iii   the general function of mind and brain    1  the generic function of
mind  as of the nervous system  is correlation  2  the special organ for
effecting fresh correlation is consciousness   3  the deliverances of
consciousness arise from stimuli acting upon structures built up by
experience   4  on foundations laid by heredity   5  which supplies not only
specific adaptations  but a background to the entire life of consciousness  

it would be hard to find a more concise  complete  and timely
formularization of the seeming trend of present resultants in this
particular direction than these sentences set forth for whomsoever will
ponder each carefully built statement and really understand what it means as
part of a system   mind is the permanent unity including consciousness and
the sum of processes continuous with consciousness and determining it  these
processes involve  but are not identical with  physical processes 
constituting with them a psychophysical unity    this quotation might almost
serve as the motto of early twentieth century scientific philosophy  it
seems to the present reviewer to have almost as much philosophy in it as
harold hoffding s well known sentence has of psychology    the unity of
mental life has its expression not only in memory and synthesis  but also in
a dominant fundamental feeling  characterized by the contrast between
pleasure and pain  and in an impulse  springing from this fundamental
feeling  to movement and activity    it might be the creed of the
neoidealism 

hobhouse s discussion of mechanism in relation to teleology and to the
universal harmony and reality is fairly representative of the drift of
thought as set forth by recent english and french writers such as j  s 
haldane  oliver lodge and some of the prominent biologists  and by henri
bergson    an organic whole is therefore like a machine in being purposive 
though unlike it in that its purpose is within    a purposive process is one
determined by its tendency to produce a certain result  purpose itself being
an act  sic  determined in its character by that which it tends to bring
about   as such it differs fundamentally from a mechanical cause     the
empirical and philosophical arguments point to the same general conclusion 
that reality is the process of the development of mind    as a guide to
one s thinking  and as integrators of one s subconscious intuitions and
resultants  such concise formulae certainly have much value  especially
when  as here  clearly and ably expounded in the text proper  tufts college

anger as a primary emotion  and the application of freudian mechanisms to
its phenomena   

    read at a meeting of the american psychopathological association  new
york city  may 5  1915 

by g  stanley hall

the exact sciences consist of a body of truth which all accept  and to which
all experts strive to contribute   philosophy  however  like religion  has
always been broken into sects  schools or parties  and the body of truth
which all accept in these fields is relatively far less  and the
antagonistic views far greater  normal psychology  which a few decades ago 
started out to be scientific with the good old ideal of a body of truth
semper ubique et ad omnibus  is already splitting into introspectionists 
behaviorists  genetic  philosophical and other groups  while in the new
freudian movement  adler and jung are becoming sectaries  the former drawing
upon himself the most impolitic and almost vituperative condemnation of the
father of psychoanalysis  with this latter schism we are not here concerned 
but we are deeply concerned with the more general relations between the
psychologists of the normal and those of the abnormal  with a very few
negligible exceptions psychoanalysis has hardly ever had a place on the
program of our american psychological association  and the normal has had
little representation in your meetings and publications  this i deem
unfortunate for both  for unsatisfactory as this sadly needed rapprochement
is on the continent  it is far more so here  that the normalists in this
country so persistently ignore the unique opportunity to extend their
purview into the psychopathological domain at the unique psychological
moment that the development of freudianism has offered  is to me a matter of
sad disappointment and almost depression  in reading a plea for freud in our
association of normalists  i am a vox clamantis in deserto and can evoke no
response  and even the incursions of psychoanalysis into the domain of
biography  myth  religion and dreams  have not evoked a single attempt at
appreciation or criticism worthy of mention by any american psychologist of
the normal   i have sought in various ways the causes of this reticence  not
to say ignorance  while i received various answers  the chief one was to the
effect that the alleged hypertrophy of sex in its gross pathological forms 
and the conviction of the kind and degree of sex consciousness found in the
many hundreds of analyzed cases  are so unique and constitute the very
essence of the neurotic and psychotic cases  and conscious and unconscious
sex factors are slight or absent in most normal cases  that these patients
and their doctors alike are sex intoxicated  and that the freudian
psychology applies only to perverts and erotomania or other abnormal cases 
to ascribe all this aversion to social or ethical repression is both shallow
and banousic  for the real causes are both manifold and deeper   they are
part of a complicated protest of normality  found in all and even in the
resistance of subjects of analysis  which is really a factor which is basal
for self control of the varying good sides of which freudians tell us
nothing  the fact is that there are other things in the human psyche than
sex  and its ramifications   hunger  despite jung  fear despite sadger  and
anger despite freud  are just as primary  aboriginal and independent as sex 
and we fly in the face of fact and psychic experience to derive them all
from sex  although it is freely granted that in morbid cases each may take
on predominant sex features  in what follows i can only very briefly hint at
the way in which some of the freudian mechanisms are applied to one of the
emotions  viz   anger 

anger in most of its forms is the most dynamogenic of all the emotions  in
paroxysms of rage with abandon we stop at nothing short of death and even
mutilation   the malay running amuck  orlando furioso  the epic of the wrath
of achilles  hell fire  which is an expression of divine wrath  are some
illustrations of its power   savages work themselves into frenzied rage in
order to fight their enemies  in many descriptions of its brutal aspects 
which i have collected  children and older human brutes spit  hiss  yell 
snarl  bite noses and ears  scratch  gouge out eyes  pull hair  mutilate sex
organs  with a violence that sometimes takes on epileptic features and which
in a number of recorded cases causes sudden death at its acme  from the
strain it imposes upon the system  its cause is always some form of
thwarting wish or will or of reduction of self feeling  as anger is the acme
of self assertion  the german criminalist  friedrich  says that probably
every man might be caused to commit murder if provocation were sufficient 
and that those of us who have never committed this crime owe it to
circumstances and not to superior power of inhibition  of course it may be
associated with sex but probably no human experience is per se more
diametrically opposite to sex  some temperaments seem to crave  if not need 
outbreaks of it at certain intervals  like a well poised lady  so
sweet tempered that everybody imposed on her  till one day at the age of
twenty three she had her first ebullition of temper end went about to her
college mates telling them plainly what she thought of them  and went home
rested and happy  full of the peace that passeth understanding  otto heinze 
and by implication pfister  think nations that have too long or too
assiduously cultivated peace must inevitably sooner or later relapse to the
barbarisms of war to vent their instincts for combat  and crile thinks anger
most sthenic  while cannon says it is the emotion into which most others
tend to pass  it has of course been a mighty agent in evolution  for those
who can summate all their energies in attack have survived  but few if any
impulsions of man  certainly not sex  have suffered more intense  prolonged
or manifold repressions   courts and law have taken vengeance into their
hands or tried to  and not only a large proportion of assaults  but other
crimes  are still due to explosions of temper  and it may be a factor in
nearly every court case  society frowns on it  and lord chesterfield says
the one sure and unfailing mark of a gentleman is that he never shows
temper  its manifestations are severely tabooed in home and school  religion
teaches us not to let the sun go down upon our wrath and even to turn the
other cheek  so that we go through life chronically afraid that we shall
break out  let ourselves go  or get thoroughly mad  so that the moment we
begin to feel a rising tide of indignation or resentment  in the
nomenclature of which our language is so very rich  chamberlain having
collected scores of english expressions of it   the censorship begins to
check it  in many cases in our returns repression is so potent from long
practice  that the sweetest smile  the kindest remarks or even deeds are
used either to veil it to others  or to evict it from our own consciousness 
or else as a self inflicted penance for feeling it  while in some tender
consciences its checked but persistent vestiges may become centers of morbid
complexes and in yet other cases it burrows and proliferates more or less
unconsciously  and finds secret and circuitous ways of indulgence which only
psychoanalysis or a moral or religious confessional could trace 

i  anger has many modes of verschiebung  both instinctive and cultivated 
one case in our returns carries a bit of wood in his vest pocket and bites
it when he begins to feel the aura of temper   girls often play the piano
loudly  and some think best of all   one plays a particular piece to divert
anger  viz   the  devil s sonata    a man goes down cellar and saws wood 
which he keeps for such occasions   a boy pounds a resonant eavespout  one
throws a heavy stone against a white rock   many go off by themselves and
indulge in the luxury of expressions they want none to hear  others take out
their tantrum on the dog or cat or perhaps a younger child  or implicate
some absent enemy  while others curse   a few wound themselves  and so on 
till it almost seems  in view of this long list of vicariates  as if almost
any attack  psychic or physical  might thus be intensified  and almost
anything or person be made the object of passion  be it remembered  too 
that not a few look  do  think  feel their best under this impulsion 

ii   besides these modes of abreagierung there are countless forms of
sublimation   in anger a boy says   i will avenge myself on the bully who
whipped me and whom i cannot or will not whip  by besting him in his
studies  class work  composition  or learn skilful stunts that he cannot do 
dress  or behave better  use better language  keep better company  and thus
find my triumph and revenge   a man rejected or scorned by a woman sometimes
makes a great man of himself  with the motivation more or less developed to
make her sorry or humiliated  anger may prompt a man to go in to win his
enemy s girl  a taunt or an insult sometimes spurs the victim of it to
towering ambition to show the world and especially the abuser better  and to
be able to despise him in return  and there are those who have been thus
stung to attempt greatness and find the sweetest joy of success in the
feeling that by attaining it they compensate for indignities they suffered
in youth  in fact  when we analyze ambition and the horror of
minderwertigkeit that goes with it  we shall doubtless find this factor is
never entirely absent  while if we were to apply the same pertinacity and
subtlety that jung in his  wandlungen  has brought to bear in working over
the treacherous material of mythology  we might prove with no less
verisimilitude than he has shown the primacy of the libido that in the
beginning was anger  and that not anaxagoras  love or the strife of
heraclitus was the fons et origo of all things  that the ichtrieb is basal 
and that the fondest and most comprehensive of all motives is that to excel
others  not merely to survive  but to win a larger place in the sun  and
that there is some connection between the darwinian psychogenesis and max
stirner and nietzsche  which adler has best evaluated 

iii   anger has also its dreams and reveries   when wronged the imagination
riots in fancied humiliation and even tortures of an enemy   an object of
hate may be put through almost every conceivable series of degradation 
ridicule  exposure and disgrace  he is seen by others for what our hate
deems him to be  all disguises are stripped off   children sometimes fancy a
hated object of anger flogged until he is raw  abandoned by all his friends 
an outcast  homeless  alone  in the dark  starving  exposed to wild animals 
and far more often more prosaic fancies conceive him as whipped by a parent
or stronger friend  or by the victim himself later   very clever strategies
are thought out in detail by which the weaker gets even with or vanquishes
the stronger  and one who suffers a rankling sense of injustice can hardly
help day dreaming of some form of comeuppance for his foe  although it takes
years to do it  in these reveries the injurer in the end almost always gives
up and sues for mercy at the feet of his quondam victim  so weird and
dramatic are these scenes often that to some minds we must call anger and
hate the chief springs of the imagination  a pubescent girl who was deeply
offended went off by herself and held an imaginary funeral of her enemy 
hearing in fancy the disparaging remarks of the bystanders  and when it was
all over and the reaction came  she made up with the object of her passion
by being unusually sweet to her and even became solicitous about her health
as fearing that her revery might come true  we all too remember tolstoi s
reminiscences when  having been flogged by his tutor  he slunk off to the
attic  weeping and broken hearted  and finally after a long brooding
resolved to run away and become a soldier  and this he did in fancy 
becoming corporal  lieutenant  captain  colonel   finally came a great
battle where he led a desperate charge that was crowned with victory  and
when all was over and he stood tottering  leaning on his sword  bloody and
with many a wound  and the great czar of all the russias approached  saluted
him as saviour of his fatherland and told him to ask whatever he wanted and
it was his  replied magnanimously that he had only done his duty and wanted
no reward   all he asked was that his tutor might be brought up and his head
cut off   then the scene changed to other situations  each very different 
florid with details  but motivated by ending in the discomfiture of the
tutor  in the ebb or ambivalent reaction of this passion he and the tutor
got on better 

iv   richardson has collected 882 cases of mild anger  introspected by
graduate students of psychology  and finds not only over determination 
anger fetishes and occasionally anger in dreams with patent and latent
aspects and about all the freudian mechanisms  but what is more important 
finds very much of the impulsion that makes us work and strive  attack and
solve problems has an element of anger at its root  life is a battle and for
every real conquest man has had to summate and focus all his energies  so
that anger is the acme of the manifestation of schopenhauer s will to live 
achieve and excel  hiram stanley rather absurdly described it as an epoch
when primitive man first became angry and fought  overcoming the great
quaternary carnivora and made himself the lord of creation   plato said
anger was the basis of the state  ribot made it the establisher of justice
in the world  and bergson thinks society rests on anger at vice and crime 
while stekel thinks that temper qualities should henceforth be treated in
every biography and explored in every case that is psychoanalyzed  hill s
experiments with pugilism  and cannon s plea for athletics as a legitimate
surrogate for war in place of james  moral substitute  frank howard s
opinion that an impulse that darwin finds as early as the sixth week and
hardly any student of childhood later than the sixth month  and which should
not be repressed but developed to its uttermost  although carefully directed
to worthy objects  are all in point  howard pleads for judicious scolding
and flogging  to be  done in heat and not in cold blood  and says that there
is enough anger in the world  were it only rightly directed  to sweep away
all the evils in it  in all these phenomena there is no trace of sex or any
of its symbols  and sadism can never explain but must be explained by it  my
thesis is  then  that every freudian mechanism applies to anger as truly as
it does to sex   this by no means assumes the fundamental identity of every
feeling emotion in the sense of weissfeld s very speculative theory 

in this very slight paper i am only trying to make the single point which i
think fear and sympathy or the gregarious or social instinct would still
better illustrate  although it would require more time  that the movement
inaugurated by freud opens up a far larger field than that of sex   the
unconscious that introspectionists deny   asserting that all phenomena
ascribed to it are only plain neural mechanisms  and therefore outside the
realm of psychology   the feelings which introspection can confessedly never
tell much about and concerning which our text books in psychology still say
so little  studies in these fields are marking a new epoch  and here the
chief merit of freudism is found 



the necessity of metaphysics

by james j  putnam  m  d 

some years ago  at the weimar congress of the international psychoanalytic
association  i read a paper on the importance of a knowledge of philosophy
and metaphysics for psychoanalysts regarded as students of human life 
perhaps if i had had the experience and ability to contribute the results of
some original analytic investigation on specific lines  i should not then
have ventured into the philosophic field  perhaps  indeed  if those
conditions now obtained i should not be bringing forward similar arguments
again  and if any one feels tempted to maintain that philosophic speculation
is a camp of refuge for those who  in consequence of temperamental
limitations and infantile fixations which ought to be overcome  draw back
from the more robust study of emotional repressions on scientific lines  i
should admit that the allegation contains an element of truth  but in spite
of this  and in spite of the fact that there is some truth also in the
statement that the effects  good and bad  of emotional repression make
themselves felt  as a partial influence  in all the highest reaches of human
endeavor  including art  literature  and religion   in spite of these
partial truths  philosophy and metaphysics are the only means through which
the essential nature of many tendencies can be studied of which
psychoanalysis describes only the transformations  and this being so it is
perhaps reasonable that one paper should be read at an annual meeting such
as this  where men assemble whose duty it is to study the human mind in all
its aspects 

i presume that just as  and just because men have minds and bodies  an
evolutional history in the ordinary sense and a mental history in a sense
not commonly considered  so there will always be two  or perhaps three 
parties among psychologists and men of science  and each one  in so far as
it is limited in its vision  may be considered as abnormal  if one will   i
decline  however  to admit that the temperamental peculiarities of one group
are more in need either of justification or of rectification through
psychoanalysis than those of the others  it is probably true that emotional
tension often plays a larger part among persons who love a priori
reasoning  the  tender minded  of dr  james  than it does in those who work
through observation  but on the other hand exclusively empirical attitude
has its limitations and its dangers  philosophy and metaphysics deal more
distinctively with essential function  that is with real existence   while
natural science and the genetic psychology  of which psychoanalysis 
strictly speaking  is a branch  deal rather with appearances and with
structure   both are in need of investigation  the form which art  religion 
and literature assume is determined by men s personal experiences and
special cravings   the essential motive of art and religion is  however  the
dim recognition by men of their relation to the creative spirit of the
universe 

no one can doubt that function logically precedes structure  or if any one
does doubt this  he need only observe his own experience and see how in
every new acquisition of knowledge or of power there come  first  the
thought  the idea  then the effort  next the habit  and finally the
modification of cerebral mechanism  in which the effort and the habit become
represented in relatively permanent and static form   in fact  the crux of
the whole discussion between science and metaphysics turns on  or harks back
to the discussion between function and structure  and it is the latter  in
the sense in which i mean the word  that has had of late a too large share
of our attention 

the enterprise on which we are all of us embarked   whether we define it as
an investigation  pure and simple  into human nature and human motives  or
as a therapeutic attempt to relieve invalids of their symptoms   is a larger
one than it is commonly conceived of as being  each physician and each
investigator has  indeed  the right to say that for practical reasons he
prefers to confine his attention to some single portion of one or the other
of these tasks  be it never so small  but each one should regard himself as
virtually under an obligation to recognize the respects in which this chosen
task is incomplete  every physicist is aware that there is some form of
energy underlying  or rather expressing itself in  light and heat and
gravitation  physicists do not study this form of energy  not because they
do not wish to but simply because they cannot do so by the only methods that
they are allowed to use   but  as a reaction of defense  they sometimes
assert that no one else can do so either  that this underlying energy cannot
be explained   to say this is  however  in my judgment  to misappreciate
what an explanation is 

to explain any matter is to discover the points of similarity  or virtual
identity  between the matter studied and ourselves  but in order to do this
thoroughly  or rather in order to do it with relation to the essential
nature of some form of energy  the  libido   for example  considered as an
unpicturable force  one must first consider what we  the investigators  are 
not at our less good  but at our best   it is with us  as given  with our
best qualities regarded as defining in part the q  e  d  of the experiment 
that the investigation must begin  the nature of any and every form of real
underlying energy or essence must be defined in terms of our sense of our
own will and freedom  and this means that we must conceive and describe
ourselves  and expect to conceive and to describe the powers that animate
us  no longer as a system of forces subject to the so called laws of nature
 which are  in reality  not immutable  but as relatively free  creative
agents  no longer as the product of the interplay of instincts  but as
individuals possessed of real reason  real power of love and real
self consistent will  to claim to study the effects of the  libido   to
which we ascribe the vast powers with which we are familiar  yet fail to
seek in it what would correspond to our own best attributes  would be to lay
aside our duties as students of human nature  it would be to confine our
attention to the  structure  of the mind  the form under which it manifests
itself  without having studied the laws of its action under conditions which
are more favorable to its development 

it must  now  have struck students of psychoanalytic literature that a
marked tendency has been shown toward supplementing the study of
structure   that is  the detailed history of men s experiences and
evolution  regarded as sequences of phenomena   by the study of the function
or creative energy for which the experiences stand   silberer  whose work is
endorsed by freud  has gone to a considerable length in this direction  and
the whole tendency of freud s insistence on the relevancy  in the mental
sphere  of the law of the conservation of energy has been a movement 
though  i think  a narrow one  in this direction  more recently  jung has
emphasized the importance of this tendency  and has dwelt more strongly  as
i think  than the facts warrant  on the supposed unwillingness of freud to
recognize its importance 

behind the experiences of childhood  for example  lie the temperamental
trends of childhood  and it is these with which we really need to get
acquainted  for these trends  if not the whole causes and equivalents of the
experiences which are recounted to us by our patients  constitute the
conditions without which the latter would not have been what they became 

but jung himself  strangely enough  in both of his carefully prepared
arguments  specifically rejects all intention of dealing  metaphysically 
with this theme  in spite of the fact that every movement toward a fuller
recognition of creative energy is nothing less than metaphysics  even though
not in name 

the skilled observer  scrutinizing the motives and peering into the history
of the person whose traits and trends he is called on to investigate  must
see  in imagination  not only a vast host of acts  but also a vast network
of intersecting lines of energy of which the casual observer  and even the
intimate friend  may be wholly unaware  we call these lines of energy by
many special names    libido  or  urlibido   first of all  then love and
hate and jealousy  and so on 

what are these lines of energy  and how can we study them to the best
purpose   obviously they are incomplete editions of the love and reason and
will the laws of which we can study to best advantage in ourselves and in
men where they are displayed in their best  that is  in their most
constructive form  to make such studies is to recognize metaphysics  but
instead of doing of doing this tacitly and implicitly we should do it openly
and explicitly 

the study of human nature should  in short  begin at the top  rather than at
the bottom  just as  if one had to choose what phase of a symphony one would
choose in order to get an idea of its perfection  one would take some
culminating moment rather than the first few notes simply because they were
the first  to be accurate  one could not do justice to the symphony except
by studying it as a whole  and similarly one should study the man as a
whole  including his relations to the universe as a whole  it is as wholes
that great poets conceived of their poems and great artists of their
pictures  and it is as a whole that each and every human life  standing as
it does as the representative of the body of the universe  and the spirit of
the universe  on the other  should implicitly be viewed 

the psychologist should sympathize deeply with the anatomist and the
physiologist and the student of cerebral pathology  but equally deeply with
the philosopher and the metaphysician who study the implications  present
although hidden  that point to the bonds between the individual and the
universe  to fail to recognize that these bonds exist   as is done when the
attempt is made to study human beings as if they were really and exclusively
the product of their historic past conceived of in an organic sense   would
be to try to build one half of an arch and expect it to endure  the truth
is  we do not  in my opinion  genuinely believe that a human is nothing but
the product of his organic past  or the product of his experience 

we believe  by implication  in our metaphysical selves and our corresponding
obligations  more strongly than we have taught ourselves to recognize  but
to this fact we make ourselves blind through a species of repression  just
as many a child  confident of its parents  affection  assumes  for his own
temporary purposes  the right to accuse them of hostile intentions which
they do not entertain 

we forget  or repress  the fact that the mind of man cannot be made subject
to the laws of physics  and yet we proceed to deal with the phenomena
dependent on the working of the mind of man as if these laws actually did
prevail 

the misleading effects of this tendency are clearly seen where it is a
question of the conclusions to be drawn from the researches  admirable in
themselves  made under the influence of the genetic method 

the notion seems to prevail that we should prepare ourselves for the
formation of just ideas with regard to the mode in which the higher
faculties of men come into existence by wiping the slate clean to the extent
of assuming that we have before us no data except some few acts or thoughts
that are definable in the simplest possible terms  and then watching what
happens as the situation becomes more complicated  but one is apt to forget 
in doing this  that there is one thing which we cannot wipe off the
slate   namely  ourselves  not taken in the bergsonian sense alone  but as
fully fledged persons  possessed of the very qualities for which we
undertake to search  yet without the possession of which the search could
not begin  this does not  of course  militate against the value of these
genetic researches in one sense   the study of evolutional sequences is
still  and forever will be  of enormous value  but it does not teach us
nearly as much of the nature of real creativeness as we can learn through
the introspection of ourselves in the fullest sense  and i maintain that
psychoanalysts are persons who could do this to advantage 

is not the notion that through the careful watching of the sequences of the
evolutionary process  as if from without  we can get an adequate idea of the
forces that really are at work  exactly the delusion by which the skillful
juggler tries to deceive his audience when he directs their attention to the
shifting objects that he manipulates  and away from his own swiftly moving
hands 

my contention is that there are other means of studying the force which we
call  libido  besides that of noting its effects  the justification for this
statement is that the force itself is identical  in the last analysis  with
that which we feel within ourselves and know as reason  as imagination  and
as will  conscious of themselves  and capable of giving to us  directly or
indirectly  the only evidence we could ever hope to get  for the existence
of real creativeness  spontaneity and freedom 

every work of art  worthy of the name  gives evidence of the action not
alone of a part of a man  but of the whole man  not only of his repressed
emotions  but of his intelligence and insight  and of relationships existing
between his life and all the other forms of life with which his own is
interwoven 

unity must prevail throughout all nature   either we are   altogether  and
through and through  our best as well as our less good   nothing but the
expression of repressed cravings  in the sense that they or the conflicts
based on them constitute the final causa vera of all progress  or else the
best that is in us and also our repressed cravings are alike due to the
action of a form of energy which is virtually greater than either one of
them  inasmuch as it has the capacity of developing into something greater
than either 

this is the agency which we should preeminently study and it is best studied
under conditions when  instead of being obviously subject to repression  it
is most free from repression  that is  it is best studied as it appears in
the thoughts and conduct of the best men  at their best  their most
constructive moments 

we cannot use our power of reason to deny our reason  for in so doing we
affirm the very thing which we deny  nor are we under the necessity of using
our reason to affirm our reason  since that is the datum without which we
cannot undertake our task 

if this view is sound  what practical conclusions can we draw from it  i
wish to insist on this question because it was distinctly and positively
with the practical end in mind that i ventured to write this paper  and i
suggest the following as a few of these conclusions 

 i  we should not speak of the  libido   in whatever sense this word is
taken  as if it were a fixed quantity  like so much heat  or so much fluid 
that is  as representing so much mesaurable force  one current notion which
has played a very useful part in psychoanalytic work  yet is misleading in
its tendency  is that the  libido  may be likened to a river which if it
cannot find an outlet through its normal channel is bound to overflow its
banks and perhaps furrow out a new path  this conception is based on this
same law of the conservation of energy to which reference has been made 
if  however  i am right in my contention that the  libido  is only one
manifestation of an energy    greater than simply  vital    which can be
studied to the best purpose only among men whose powers have been cultivated
to the best advantage  then it will be seen that this conception of  libido 
as a force of definite amount is not justifiable by the facts 

one does not find that love or reason is subject to this quantitative law 
on the contrary  the persons whom most of us recognize as of the highest
type do not love any given individual less because their love takes in
another  the bond of love holds not only three  but an indefinite number 

the same statement may be made with regard to reason and to will  the power
and quantity of them are not exhausted but are increased by use 

i maintain  then  that although the  libido   in so far as it is regarded as
an instinct  does not stand on the same footing with the reason and
disinterested love of a person of high cultivation and large views  neither
does it stand on the same footing with the physical energy that manifests
itself in light and heat and gravitation 

when we come to deal with man and any of his attributes  or as we find them
at any age  we ought to look upon him  in my estimation  as animated in some
measure by his self foreshadowing best  and whether it is dreams with which
we have to do  or neurotic conflicts  or wilfulness  or regression  we shall
learn to see  more and more  as we become accustomed to look for evidences
thereof  the signs of this sort of promise  just as we might hope to learn
to find  more and more  through the inspection of a lot of seeds of
different plants  the evidences which would enable us to see the different
outcomes which each one is destined to achieve  even though  at first  they
all looked just alike 

 2  the next point has reference to  sublimation   this outcome of
individual evolution  as defined by freud  has a strictly social  not an
ethical  meaning   jung also  in the interesting paper referred to  in his
description of the rational aims of psychoanalysis  makes sublimation
 though he does not there use the word  the equivalent of a subjective sense
of well being  combined with the maximum of biologic effectiveness 

 die psychoanalyse soll eine biologische methode sein  welche das hoechste
subjektive wohlbefinden mit der wertwollsten biologischen leistung zu
vereinigen sucht  

but in my opinion  while it may be true that the psychoanalyst may often
have reason to be thankful if he can claim a therapeutic outcome of this
sort  the logical goal of a psychoanalytic treatment is not covered by the
securing of a relative freedom from subjective distress  even when combined
with the satisfactory fulfillment of one s biologic mission  a man has
higher destinies than this  and the sense of incompleteness felt by the
neurotic patient  which was emphasized by janet and is recognized by us all 
must be more or less painfully felt by every man whose conscience does not
assure him that he is really working for an end greater than that here
specified  the logical end of a psychoanalytic treatment is the recovery of
a full sense of one s highest destiny and origin and of the bearings and
meanings of one s life 

on similar grounds i think that the conflicts to which all men find
themselves subjected  must be considered  in the last analysis  as conflicts
of an ethical description  for it is only in ethical terms that one can
define one s relation to the universe regarded as a whole  just as it is
only in ethical terms that a man could describe his sense of obligation to
support the dignity of fine family traditions or the ideals represented by a
team or a social group of which he felt reason to be proud  i realize that a
man s sense of pride of his family  his team  or his country may be a
symptom of narcistic self adulation  but like all such signs and
symbols  the symbol of the church tower  for example  this is a case where
two opposing meanings meet 

every act and motive of our lives  from infancy to age  is controlled by two
sets of influences  the general nature of which has here been made
sufficiently clear  they correspond on the one hand  to the numerous partial
motives which psychoanalysis studies to great advantage  and on the other
hand  to the ethical motives which are only thoroughly studied by
philosophy 

 3  another conclusion  which seems to me practically of great importance 
follows from this same view  every one who has studied carefully the life
histories of patients  especially of children  and has endeavored in so
doing to follow step by step the experiences through which they reach the
various mile stones on their journey  must have been astonished to observe
the evidences of preparedness on their part for each new step in this long
journey   human beings seem predestined  as it were  not only in a physical
but in a mental sense  for what is coming  and the indications of this in
the mental field are greater than the conditions of organic evolution could
readily account for  the transcendency of the mind over the brain shows
itself here as elsewhere 

we are told that our visions of the unpicturable  the ideal world  which our
imagination paints and which our logical reasoning calls for as the
necessary cap or final corollary to any finite world which our intelligence
can actually define    that such visions are nothing but the pictures of
infantile desires projected on to a great screen and made to mock us with
the appearance of reality 

i have nothing whatever to say against the value of the evidence that a
portion of our visions are of this origin  in fact  i believe this as
heartily as does any one  but i desire strenuously to oppose the view
tacitly implied in the statement of the projection theory just cited  the
acceptance of which as an exclusive doctrine would involve the virtual
rejection of our right  as scientific men  to rely on the principle that the
evidence afforded by logical presuppositions and logical inference is as
cogent as that furnished through observation 

it is  in my opinion  just because we all belong to a world which is in
outline not  in the making  but completed   because  in short  we are in one
sense like heirs returning to our estates   that this remarkable
preparedness of each child is found that impresses us so strongly  the
universe is  in a sense  ours by prescriptive right and by virtue of the
constitution of our minds   but the unity of such a universe must  of
course  be of a sort that includes and indeed implies diversity and conflict
as essential elements of its nature 

psychoanalysts should not make light of inferential forms of reasoning  for
it is on this form of reasoning that the value of their own conclusions
largely rests   we infer contrary meanings for words that are used
ostensibly in one sense  and we infer special conflicts in infancy of which
we have but little evidence at hand  and cravings and passions of which it
may be impossible to find more than a few traces by way of direct testimony 

our immediate environment and the world that surrounds us in that sense 
appear to our observation  indeed  as  in the making   but besides the power
of observation which enables  and indeed forces us to see the imperfection
in this environmental world  we possess  or are possessed by  a mental
constitution which compels us  with still greater force  to the belief in a
goal of positive perfection of which our nearer goals are nothing but the
shadow 

it is because i believe in the necessity of such reasoning as this that i am
not prepared to accept the  lust unlust  principle  that is  to use
philosophical terms  the  hedonistic  principle  as representing the forces
by which even the child is finally animated  men do not reach their best
accomplishments  if indeed they reach any accomplishment  through the
exclusive recognition  either unconscious or instinctive  of a utilitarian
result  or a result which can be couched in terms of pleasure or personal
satisfaction as the goal of effort  they may state the goal to themselves in
these terms  but this is  then  the statement of what is really a fictitious
principle  a principle in positing which the patient does but justify
himself and does not define his real motive   utilitarianism and hedonism
and the pleasure pain principle  useful though they are  are alike imperfect
in that they refer to partial motives  partial forms of self expression 
whereas that which finally moves men to their best accomplishments and makes
them dissatisfied with anything less than this  is the necessity rather than
the desire to take complete self expression as their final aim  the partial
motives are more or less traceable as if by observation  the larger motives
must be felt and reached through inferential reasoning  based on observation
of ourselves through careful introspection 

finally  the practical  therapeutic question arises  as to what measures the
psychoanalyst is justified in taking to bring about the best sort of outcome
in a given case 

it is widely felt that the psychoanalyst would weaken his own hold on the
strong typically analytic principles through which painful conflicts are to
be removed if he should form the habit of dealing with ethical issues  and
talking of  duties   instead of stimulating his patients to the discovery of
resistances and repressions  even of repression the origin of which is not
to be found within the conscious life   yet   parallel  as one might say 
with this clear cut standard of professional psychoanalytic obligation  the
force of which i recognize   it has to be admitted that there are certain
fairly definite limitations to the usefulness of psychoanalysis  as one of
these limitations  well pronounced symptoms of egoism  taking the form of
narcissism  are to be reckoned  these symptoms are not easily analyzed away 
but if one asks oneself  or asks one s patients  what conditions might  if
they had been present from the outset  have prevented this narcistic outcome
 jehovah type  etc    the influence that suggests itself  looming up in
large shape  is just this broad sense of ethical obligation to which
repeated reference has here been made  if these patients could have had it
brought home to them in childhood that they belonged  not to themselves
conceived of narrowly  that is  as separate individuals  but only to
themselves conceived of broadly as representatives of a series of
communities taken in the largest sense  the outcome that happened might
perhaps have been averted 

and what might have happened may still happen   what is to be done  each
physician must decide this for himself   he should be able both to do his
best as a psychoanalyst and at the same time help the patient to free
himself from that sort of repression in consequence of which he is unable to
see his own best possibilities  but he cannot do this unless he has trained
himself to see and feel in himself the outlines of this vision any more than
he could help the patient to rid himself of an infantile complex if he did
not appreciate what this complex means  we must trust ourselves  as
physicians  with deadly weapons  and with deadly responsibilities  and we
ought to be well harried by our consciences if we should do injustice  in
using them  either to our scientific or our philosophic training 



aspects of dream life   

    it should be stated as possibly bearing on the interpretation of the
dreams recorded by the author  who is well known to me  that she is the
subject of an intense and unusual obsession of hatred of an obtrusively
pathological character against a relative  the psycho pathology of the
obsession  of which i have an intimate knowledge  has not been determined 
a reasonable interpretation is that the main etiological factor is jealousy 
she has undergone prolonged psychoanalytic treatment by a skilled
psycho analyst without improvement of the obsession and without revealing a
satisfactory explanation of its pathology  to what extent the contents of
the dreams have been determined or coloured by culture acquired by this
treatment and by the study of freudian doctrines is also a question
deserving of consideration   editor 

the contribution of a woman

it is an easy matter to accept upon authority a given scientific theory and
bring to its support certain selected evidence  but quite another to
carefully observe and report phenomena  inspired  influenced and guided
indeed by the scientific theory but drawing conclusions no wider or deeper
than individual insight warrants  scientific knowledge advances not by ready
acceptance of theories but by original observation and experiment and the
following study of dreams is offered as fulfilling in some degree the latter
requirement  while there is a certain familiarity on the part of the writer
with the general theory advanced by freud and with his principles of
interpretation  there is no acquaintance at first hand with his die
traumdeutung  the reading of which has been postponed lest there be excess
of influence 

no apology is offered for this invasion of the domain of psychology by a
layman   the laboratory of the mind is open to all and he who has missed
conventional training may yet chance upon valuable facts and their
interpretation   neither is apology offered for the intimate nature of the
data reported  belonging as dreams do to the most personal and private life
of the individual it is nevertheless true that continued and careful study
of this form of mentation insensibly alters one s attitude so that at length
the dream appears as a fact of nature  impersonal and objective 

it is a common remark that if one tells his dreams their number will
increase but this increase is probably only apparent  with attention the
products of the dream self become more accessible until one who is practiced
in introspection can raise the number of his remembered dreams from one in
two or three nights to five  ten  or even fourteen in a single night   even
at this maximum of remembrance one feels that but a fraction of the mind s
nocturnal activity is recalled  images emerge in consciousness and fall back
into obscurity before the waking thought can grasp them   or it may be more
accurate to say that upon awakening consciousness rises from level to level 
it sometimes happens that when first awake i recall several dreams which
vanish utterly as a sudden shifting of consciousness occurs  then  upon this
new level  a new set of dreams appears   there is reason to believe that in
thinking again of a dream which has once been recalled it is not the
original dream experience which comes to mind but the copy made in the
waking consciousness when it first emerged  on the other hand visions
recognized as dreams belonging to a long past time occasionally float into
the mind giving rise to the suspicion that they have not before reached the
waking consciousness  it is possible that all dreams are recorded in the
depths of the mind  themselves influencing and merging with later dreams 

the number of my dreams recalled and written out during three years closely
approaches five thousand and without doubt the total number far exceeds
this   i am inclined to the belief that constantly  by day as well as by
night  we are dreaming  that unnoticed and independent trains of thought are
carried on   at times when resting if i fall into an abstracted state  not
of set purpose  i find myself in the midst of a stream of thought appearing 
for the moment  perfectly natural  familiar and intelligible  as if i knew
the beginning and end of the matter  but only for a moment will
consciousness remain at this lower level  there is a sudden return to the
normal plane  the passage fades from memory and i wonder what on earth it
was all about   these phases of subconscious activity differ from dreams
proper in the absence of visual images  the ideas are embodied in words 
heard with the mind one might say  the source may be the same as that of the
night visions but it is evident that during the day the incessant
stimulation of the eye from without leaves no opportunity for the emergence
of the secondary visual images pertaining to subconscious ideas  which  we
are told by dr  morton prince  furnish the perceptual elements of the dream 
the other senses are sometimes represented   often we are performing  or
trying to perform  some action   but dreams are predominantly visual  goethe
has said   i believe men only dream that they may not cease to see  

an account of the probable genesis of the memory images not only furnishes a
clue to the mechanism of dreaming but to the underlying conditions as well 
the lowest forms of life possess no image forming power   they have no sense
organs  sensation is diffused over the entire form and undifferentiated 
gradually  as the scale of life is ascended  certain parts of the organisms
become specially sensitive to certain stimuli and eventually individual
organs give separate and distinct reports of phenomena   a substance
hitherto merely felt  is seen  heard  smelled  tasted   the passage from
sensation to perception occurs when but one or two of the sense organs are
stimulated by an object  yet  because of nervous connections established
during former more close and complete experience of the object the remaining
sense organs are faintly roused  sending into consciousness copies of former
sensations  thus the whole is present to mind while but a part to sense  in
the developing brain the store of memory images of various kinds would
rapidly increase and these images would come at length to have a more or
less independent existence  it is probable that the next step in the making
of mind was the synthesis of one set of sense impressions to form an idea of
the object  the first abstraction  and thenceforth a sensation gave rise to
an idea   there is at this stage no impulse to explain sensations  but
involuntarily  from the store of memory images  and from the reservoir of
ideas above  emerges a representation of the exciting object  if this is one
to which the organism is accustomed the resulting complex in the highest
nerve centers fits the subject  but as evolution proceeds and environment
and capacity for sensation grow more complex  new stimulations occur  in the
absence of the capacity for knowledge and understanding of the object the
developing mind  true to its law  brings forward mental images most nearly
related  those which fit in one or two respects   and thus we have the birth
of analogy   the inference of a further degree of resemblance from an
observed degree of resemblance  

to look at one s self is a late endowment   the kitten pursues its own tail
but would chase that of its mother with equal ardor  i once saw a monkey
searching industriously with eyes and hands upon its own body   the sight
was startling  i had never before seen an animal look intelligently at
itself  it was long before man distinguished his self from the world
without  and longer still before he began to understand himself  physical
and mental phenomena  pain and pleasure  could not be tracked to their
sources and so came to be expressed in terms of the world of nature  and for
a reason precisely similar that portion of the self functioning in sleep
makes use of symbolism  occasionally the higher thought centers are involved
but the typical dream is the product of a restricted  primitive self 
lacking the resources of the complete personality and limited in power of
expression   in dreams we are deficient in self consciousness because it is
only a partial self that dreams  our wishes are rarely given clear and
definite expression for the reason that the section of the mind then active
is incapable of clear  definite and adequate concepts  symbolism and
reasoning by analogy are the resources of the mind until the power of
knowledge dawns 

predicating then a dream self by its nature largely restricted to the use of
symbolism and having at its disposal a vast store of images endlessly
susceptible to influences which combine and alter their form  we reach the
crucial question  what initiates the dream  this is by no means a mere
purposeless thronging of visual images as occasionally happens in the period
preceding sleep when faces  forms and scenes flit aimlessly before the
mind s eye  some bare replicas of stimulations of the eye from without 
others the attendant visual images of past thoughts and experiences and
their distorted combination   somewhat closer to actual dreaming is the rise
of images accompanying present bodily and mental states  i sometimes see a
body in the posture my own body has that moment assumed and one night  when
recalling a passage from wilhelm meister  i saw a young man seated
bareheaded on a doorstep  plainly a picture of wilhelm at marianna s
threshold  in the last example we come definitely upon a vision induced from
within  an idea working downward upon the visual centers  still nearer
dreams  indeed if occurring in sleep they would be classed with them  are
the purely imaginative pictures whose cause is as mysterious as that of the
actual dream  fire in the wall near the pantry door  a garden with a woman
rising from a clump of bushes  high  rocky mountain tops  a perpendicular
wall of rock and against it a man on a ladder reaching for a flower  a long
vista ending with a pillared temple on a hill   these are a few of my
visions before sleep  but to return   why the dream   are all or most dreams
sexual  can we say with freud that they express the fulfillment of repressed
desires 

it is not my purpose to attempt a complete answer to this question as i am
far from understanding even the majority of my own dreams  broadly speaking
i should say that considering the amount and complexity of the material on
hand which the mind may use and the probable inconceivable number of dreams
it is unlikely that all are concerned with this matter  this question may
well be allowed to rest for the present  but certain convictions have arisen
in my mind as the result of the study of hundreds of personal dreams 
convictions which do not rest upon the arbitrary interpretation of accepted
symbolism  though i am far from questioning the validity of this procedure 
i venture little beyond the region illuminated by individual insight though
examples are cited far exceeding my power of interpretation 

the sexual theory of dreams has by some authorities been characterized as
greatly over emphasized  as failing to take account of other factors and
interests of human personality  to those critics let me present the matter
briefly and simply  the very fact of a person s being alive today
presupposes an ancestry stretching backward through uncounted ages  an
ancestry whose chief function  up to very recent times  was sexual and
reproductive  modern interests  business  social  intellectual  religious 
artistic and philanthropic  which today loom so large  are a recent
innovation  occupying in comparison with the period when they were not but a
moment of time   in a vertical section of man  both racial and individual 
they are seen to constitute but a superficial layer  from a contemporary
standpoint predominant and paramount but in the light of the ages secondary
and unstable  biologically a woman is only an agent for the reproduction of
her kind  more than this  with mind  all save the conscious  socially and
ethically restricted sections  set toward the same end and toward the means
for its accomplishment  there is no gainsaying this fact and in my dreams
which yielded to analysis it stands paramount   i am inclined to disregard
the theory of a  censor  for the reason that after i had admitted to my
thought and frankly considered certain facts  by a thousand devious hints 
by a thousand subterfuges  my subconsciousness continued to express these
same facts by means of obscure symbolism  as the savage seizes upon one link
in a chain of events expecting thereby to repossess the whole  as the native
of borneo makes a wax figure of his enemy in the belief that as the image
melts  the enemy s body will waste away  as the women of sumatra when sowing
rice let the hair hang loose down their backs in order that the rice may
grow luxuriantly and have long stalks  so this woman  this under self 
ignorant of the true law of cause and effect  and unable to form definite
concepts  instinctively selects from the innumerable memories and visual
images at her disposal those having relation to her unfulfilled function and
forms a picture or weaves a tale  expecting through the performance of some
remotely associated act the complete result 

to the events of an hour or so  supremely significant from a biological
standpoint  are related a very large number of my dreams  again and again
events of that day and of the preceding days form the basis of dreams 
trivial circumstances are revived one by one and fragments of the experience
itself are seized  distorted and each woven into what i can no longer term
 the baseless fabric of a vision    for instance the day preceding i broke
my umbrella and found a shop where it was mended  in dream after dream
appears that broken umbrella under various circumstances and when i ask the
reason for its apparent importance i can not escape the conclusion that the
article in question stands for a period of time  a series of events  in
which the dream self would again be placed  apparently on that road
opportunity lay in waiting  therefore by any means at her disposal must that
path be regained  involuntarily the language of metaphor is assumed in
attempting to describe a process so far removed from actual knowledge  still
are we driven to avail ourselves of the expedient of primitive man 

of the dreams presently to be cited only a part fall within the category of
analogical reasoning  in none of the examples is a complete analysis
attempted  the mind of each reader may carry the solution of the problem as
far as it will   i am content merely to furnish a clue  that each dream is
of great significance must not be assumed  but that each one  even though it
appear a mere fanciful reverie  means something can hardly be doubted   at
the outset it is acknowledged that the dreams recorded followed a period of
intense emotion when  through the exigencies of life the strongest instinct
of humanity required control and repression  further the writer is a
musician and a botanist  and especially interested in biological and social
problems  study of the latter subjects was continued throughout the period
in question   it must be confessed also that though loth to accept the
sexual theory of dreams  once convinced of its at least partial truth i was
on the watch for confirmation  i expected sexual symbolism   on the other
hand each dream was absolutely spontaneous  an utter surprise  having no
slightest likeness to any creation of my waking mind and seeming to rise
from a region so remote as to be not myself  it should be noted also that
the greater number of the nearly five thousand remembered dreams  all but
very few in fact  would have remained in the limbo of the unconscious but
for the persistent and trained effort which rescued them from oblivion 
neither by  nor apparently for my waking self were they formed 

each individual mind  besides sharing in the symbolism common to mankind 
has doubtless its own particular and special forms  for instance during the
period covered by my study no less than ninety different varieties of plant
life figured in my dreams  not including indefinite ferns  moss  grass 
weeds and trees  and several plants noted somewhat in detail yet unlike any
form known to me   of the recognizable plants a number were used somewhat
cleverly for their analogical significance  of these may be mentioned the
snowball and hydrangea whose flowers as every botanist knows are sterile 
the size of the individual blossom being gained at the expense of loss of
stamens and pistils  these plants were plainly used to indicate barrenness
and the predominance of traits other than sexual   the keen critic will here
interpose an objection   how is the primitive  unreasoning dream self able
to make use of symbolism whose import is known only to higher and developed
states of mind  the force of the objection is granted and without attempting
fully to answer it i will say that the likeness of the primitive mind of the
race to that surviving in the highly evolved individual is only partial 
like tendencies exist but the influence of a great body of knowledge above
inevitably alters the action of the latter  maidenhair fern stood
indubitably in several instances for the pubic hair  once surrounding a
cluster of trailing arbutus when talcum powder of that fragrance had been
used on the body  i dreamed of linnaea borealis  the little twin flower  in
connection with a woman who a few days before when told of the birth of
twins to a friend  said   that is the way to have them come   lettuce  for
its milky juice obviously  appeared in two bunches on the front of the waist
of a woman into whose house i had broken by leaning against a screen door 
and a lawn bordered by cowslips  our common name for caltha palustris 
certainly represented a certain lawn that a friend told me had been kept
mown by the cows feeding upon it when driven from pasture 

in each of the above instances the floral symbolism was part of an elaborate
dream having wider significance leaving no doubt as to the accuracy of my
conclusions   a particularly interesting and devious use of flowers occurs
in the following dream  i am in front of a certain house over which  in the
dream  is growing a vine having white  star like  fragrant blossoms  i want
one flower and the woman living there says i may have it  the name of the
vine seems to be  dyak    there is no plant having that name but a few
months before i was reading of the dyak girls of borneo who  are very
careful of their clothing  and often very vain  but when they are married
they frequently become exceedingly untidy   i quoted the passage in an
article thus fixing it in my mind  the link with the dream consists in the
fact that the woman living in the vine decorated house is  in reality 
notoriously untidy  her two daughters as they approached womanhood greatly
improved in the daintiness of their garb  and one had become pregnant  
outside marriage   another dream   i see a friend  by name anna  stoop and
pull from the ground a tiny lily of the valley plant  it has no roots   i
say   what a pity    this dream had no meaning until into my mind came the
thought of another anna  a young girl who was led astray and who  i had just
been told  had taken medicine to terminate her pregnancy   when i learned of
this i had thought of the loss of the incipient life  the same night i
dreamed of going upstairs in a shed or barn  at the top of the stairs
something  a door  is in the way  i go by it   a child is there   again   i
am crossing a level field and come upon little star like flowers which i try
to analyse   i find many with pistils but no stamens   the pollen bearing
organs which effect fertilization  i wonder if they will keep fresh until i
reach home  once more   i approach a city   i see woods and two gardens 
either flower or vegetable  from which comes music   on a mound wild flowers
are growing  some white  some small and dark  i gather them   then very
remote and vague   my brother is there  i see a long snake which my brother
puts on    and covers my flowers   still another vision was of a branch of
beautiful  fragrant apple blossoms growing through the wall of a room  some
of the flowers were pistillate  some staminate   a condition false to nature
as regards the apple 

a dream  which in common with many others  seems not the fulfillment of a
wish but the symbolical expression of a bodily and mental state  is the
following   after a day of very great physical restlessness i dream that i
am walking in a path by a river   i can not see the water for the
over hanging trees beneath whose branches grow quantities of impatiens
fulva  the spotted touch me not   named from the sudden bursting of the pod
when touched  the plant in question i had not seen for some time and the
fitness of the symbolism to the bodily state was too close to be accidental 
after a walk in the spring when the ground was white with the cotton tufted
seeds of the poplar and i thought if all germinated how overwhelmed we
should be with poplars  i dream that i am sweeping a floor upon which cotton
is scattered  some of which flies and is caught in my hair  i dream of
walking under pine trees whose pollen falls on me  and finally  though
examples of the significant use of plants are by no means exhausted  i have
upon awakening the vision of a pine tree growing from my nose  this strange
anomaly becomes intelligible when i recall that a friend told me that the
pores of her nose were enlarged  and i said mine were also  we had been
talking of a quotation from emerson relating to nature s fecundity  my
friend was soon to be married  and a line from emerson often in my thought
is that in regard to pines  throwing out pollen for the benefit of the next
century  

for a musician to dream of playing  or of trying to play  upon an organ or
piano is apparently the most natural thing in the world and an attempt at
interpretation is  to uninstructed common sense  a journey far afield   yet
the strange and striking variations introduced and the hindrances to my
accomplishment of the act invest the dream with marked significance   for
instance   it is after church service and i want to play upon the pipe
organ  i find my music   the stool is a kettle of water with a board over
it  a stream of water comes from the organ   there is a horse near which
kicks or bites me   again   i play on the piano to a friend who is a german
scholar the opening theme of the tristan and isolde prelude   my friend
tells me the pronunciation of the title of the opera and it sounds to me
like froebel   that the name of the world famous music drama  the apotheosis
of passion  should be transformed to that of the notable child educator is
nonsense or otherwise according to the observer s point of view  another
dream   some children want me to play and i go to the piano and try to play
the spring song   but the piano stops sounding  only a few bass notes
respond   i dream that a table of sheet music is on fire  sometimes the
music is too far away or too high for me to see  the notes are flowers  or
books  or animals  or  hanging objects   or queer figures  in the book from
which i play are pictures of the sea  a ship  a person  and birds  sea
gulls  among them  the bed becomes an organ upon which i try to play   i
begin to play the witches  dance and there are not enough keys to the piano 
again the keys are covered by a cloth or there are no keys  an organ behind
me is played and i see no organist  or i move the pedals of an organ and
music begins before the instrument is open  i try to play and the stops are
wrong   often i search frantically for the hymn given out by the minister
and can not find it  once i picked flowers in its place  drooping racemes of
sweet alyssum  which i gave to a woman   oddest of all on the keys of a
piano i see a small boy who salutes me   lastly  i play for children to
sing  at the top of the page of music are whole notes  easy to play  below
there are whole notes in groups of two  joined like confluent living cells 

there are several examples of punning to record  not brilliant  even
somewhat vulgar yet interesting as exhibiting varieties of mental action  i
dream that i am at a barn yard trying to hold the gate shut  in the yard are
two men  each with an animal  a kid  one light  one dark   the light kid is
unmanageable  pawing and shaking its head  some days elapsed before the
interpretation dawned upon me but once noted could not be doubted   several
weeks previously i had a business engagement and of two pairs of
gloves  kids  i hesitated which to wear  i was to do some writing
necessitating their removal and as one fastening of a light glove was
difficult i fixed upon the dark pair  as to ask help would under the
circumstances  have proved exceedingly embarrassing 

a friend had informed me of her approaching marriage   i dream of eating at
a table with her   i take meat but she wants me to do she does  so i return
the meat i had chosen and take spare rib  this variety of meat i had neither
eaten nor thought of for months and the conclusion that the reference is to
the story of adam and eve is inevitable   i dream of eating at the table of
a friend  i am a little sick and cannot eat all that is given me  my friend
points smilingly to a package of stuffed dates on my plate  one date is
apart from the package   this dream relates unmistakably to a day when i had
a pressure of engagements and had not time to eat  when i did feel slightly
ill  and when one very significant engagement was made unexpectedly  a date
apart from the others  a kiss of her lover upon the lips of a young girl
becomes in my dream a piece of court plaster on her upper lip  and a woman
about whose prospective marriage some one asked  returns  in my night vision
to a university to obtain the degree of b  ed   which in sleep i took to
indicate bachelor of education but which is open to a different
interpretation 

visions of natural scenery are most remote  strange  beautiful and
delightful   they are doubtless composites of actual localities but in their
construction and use fine powers of imagination are at work and real life
seems left far behind  in my dreams of this type the ocean stands as a
symbol of life itself  of the mighty and profound procreative force the
entrance into whose domination is the crisis of existence  for this
experience is demanded the mightiest symbol  it is evening   i am on the
seashore with my father and mother  greatwaves are rolling in   i look
backward and see one wave break where we have passed   my mother is afraid
but we cannot turn back   i am calm   then  this immediately follows  i am
in a kind of tunnel and fear that i shall suffocate  this and the following
might be construed as symbolising my own birth   i am in a boat on the ocean
with my mother  the waves are tremendous and as she goes out on deck to
close a great door i fear she will be washed away   but she is safe  next
there is a violent jar and the boat is aground  then i see down a city
street   in a particularly impressive dream i approach the sea at early
morning  i think i shall see the sun rise from the water   i go over a hill
to reach the ocean which is frozen near the shore  i go into a little house
and when i come out i can not close the door   the wind is high and the
waves enormous  then there is calm and i see a man on horseback in the
water  next a fog rises and out of the mist a little boat comes toward me 
the oars flashing like silver   then a little boy comes ashore  there are
strange dreams of a frozen ocean  and of being out in a small boat with a
friend  soon to be married  with ships passing and we afraid   i am near the
ocean and longing to see it  and once trying to go with some one to see the
foundation of the sea but am hindered 

among visions of mountains is the following   i see high and beautiful
mountains as i stand on a bridge   i hear the squeal of a horse  then stones
fall from a mountain top into the stream and spirals of bright water rise to
meet them   after receiving from a man of vigorous  vital personality an
atomizer for a slight hay fever  i dream of high mountains and at the foot
of one is an irregular patch of red sunlight   above are two houses  not
side by side  in front of them is a fine  slanting veil of rain  a dream in
which indications of the reputed  father complex  may be found is one of my
father and myself in a team at the top of a high mountain  at the end of the
road   my father wants to drive off among the peaks but i fear that we shall
be lost  i dread the night there but think i can call for help  somewhat
similar is the following   i am in a high  steep place with my father   i
fear   he moves a stone and in the hollow of a rock i see moss or fungus 
there are often brief  passing dreams in which no person figures   i see a
bridge across a chasm  it is long and extends beyond where a bridge is
necessary  i see two rivers join and wonder what the resulting stream is
called  i see a river from the side of which emerges a spring of water and a
new stream   a small  steep hill  snow capped  a river with water above the
banks 

to dream of moving to an old house  what signifies this   apparently
nothing  if one is to dream it must be of something  houses or people or
scenery  but to dream often of going to live in an ancient house   of trying
to find in it my room  mosquito netting at the window  not quite tight  from
my room into a smaller one a door which i try to fasten but can not because
at the bottom it is a swaying curtain  the wall paper loose and a mouse hole
near the floor  a long  sunshiny room where i see what appears to be a rat
but which becomes a little kitten  weak from long confinement  that follows
me from room to room and at last through a door leading to a porch   why all
these accessories   once i go through many rooms  furnished but
uninhabited  and come to an upper bed chamber where  upon a couch  lies a
woman  quite dead i think  but presently she moves one hand   again i go
through room after room until i reach one where still another woman  or is
it the same  lies dead on the bed  as i look she becomes a beautiful child
who has lain there forty years  the child stirs and opens its eyes  i think
something should be done to keep it alive but the eyes close  and sleep  or
death  reigns again  after calling upon an expectant mother who showed me
her layette  all white and blue  i dream that i go in an old house to a room
with blue papered walls  a blue and white spread on the bed and a case of
books  one of which is dickens  great expectations   in one old house i find
the bulbs of some plant sprouting on a shelf  in another i open the stove
and find to my surprise that fire is still there   in still another house i
see behind the stove a closed door which i long to open  i go about the
house  up steep  worn stairs  down again and out into a garden where there
is a single strawberry and i think staminate and pistillate plants should be
set out to insure fertilization   always i think of the closed door and
presently i return to the house and enter the room behind the stove   on the
floor is a green veil of firm texture  and at last there are cobwebs on the
ceiling of my old house and i still search for my room 

after the presentation of this array of symbolism quite spontaneously the
interpretation arose in my mind  the old house is the recurring abode of
life   i would dwell there and take my place in the line of succession 
quite in line with this symbolism was the very beautiful dream of a young
woman not many months before her bridal which i give in her words   with a
crowd of unknown people i was to visit and go over a haunted house   the
living room was nicely furnished in antique furniture and the whole house
was very still  we went upstairs  and it passed through my mind that people
who were dead and gone had moved through the rooms  i was coming down the
stairs when suddenly a pipe organ burst forth  that was the haunted
part  music in the air  no organ at all  we were awestricken and i awoke
with the same feeling   in dreams of this character we find it necessary to
predicate a creative  myth making tendency in the structure of the mind by
means of which currents of life flowing beneath all thought become
articulate 

coming now to examples of reasoning by analogy directly expressive of the
desire for maternity  i wish to make still more plain my view of the reason
for symbolism   maternity is untold ages old  intelligent comprehension of
the function very recent   that portion of the mind functioning in
dreams  that is in the majority of dreams  is unable to picture the process
and its necessary antecedents   frankly sexual dreams occurred to me very
rarely   instinctive acts are the last to be made objects of thought  a
relatively high degree of mental development is necessary before the
requisite detachment from the process can be obtained and as we have seen
this detachment is beyond the power of the self that dreams  hence the
recourse to analogy and symbolism 

i call upon a woman who is pregnant and whose face is slightly bloated  in
that night s dream i look in a mirror and see that my face is plump  i think
i am too old   i see on the street a young girl in short skirts wheeling a
baby carriage   my friend tells me that the girl is a mother  that night i
dream of being in a shop to buy an article which i in reality intended to
purchase and in addition looking at a dress for a girl of twelve or
fourteen   i hear of a pregnant woman who ran away and worked for a time in
a mill and a night or two after i have a dream of a devious walk with many
details which finally ends at a kind of factory  an expectant mother tells
me of her trip to a neighboring town where a friend gave her a tiny
crocheted jacket   soon after i start in a dream for that town  afoot  in
the dark  without lantern or money  and hampered and stumbling  make the
weary journey 

a dream which upon analysis proves extremely interesting is the following   
i come out from a house and stand looking at other houses   i am waiting for
some one  and look toward the street   in the yard i see a large elm tree
nearly sawed off but at one side the wood is continuous   to indicate that
the tree is still alive   i look up   a bough sways and i am dizzy  i think
the bough will fall   beneath the tree is a sick woman on a couch  until the
clue was found this appeared a mere aimless mixture of imagery but one
circumstance makes it very clear   shortly before i was reading a book on
biology and in the section devoted to the influence of environment on
organisms a portion of the trunk of an elm tree was shown and the influence
of various factors noted as indicated by the annual rings of growth  one
considerable variation was due to the fact that children had swung from one
limb of the tree   at the time of reading the fact made so slight an
impression that after the dream some time elapsed before i recalled it and
then so faintly that i had to refer to the book for verification  thus we
see upon what slight and obscure basis a dream may be constructed 

that all dreams do not originate in one section or at one level of the mind
is quite evident   the range extends from those which almost merge with
waking thought to creations strangely remote and primitive  when i dream
that goethe is a guest at my home and i am trying to ask him in regard to
faust  wilhelm meister and mignon   when after reading of x rays  ether
waves and electrons wake with the thought   to solve the problem of matter
would prove materialism    when i dream that i am conversing with a
conservative friend who says that he does not like new religions and i reply
that moses and jesus were new once  it is plain that a different stratum of
mind is operative than when i dream that i am in an old fort and chased by
three rats  or that a snake is on my bed and my father kills it with a
pitchfork  or strangest of all  that i throw an egg at the plug of a sap
bucket which it hits and then flies to the left  it is rotten   again  a
very vague dream  i  see two eggs and then am climbing inside a kind of
tower  a dream which immediately preceded the menstrual period  is as
follows   i pass a narrow  dark canal which seems to be under cover  on the
very brink is a child and i fear it will fall in  a man is there whose
business it is to save the child but be does not  that this indicates the
impending passage from the body of the ovum can hardly be doubted   under
like conditions  this before sleep  i see a doorway filled with flowers 

it was natural that after a time i should wonder what event of the day would
be woven into a dream  as i performed certain acts i found myself wondering 
will this appear tonight  and how  one sunday i walked across lots to church
and on the way picked a twig of balm of gilead poplar keeping it with me
through service for its fragrance   that night i dream that i am in a
pasture looking for fertile fronds of the cinnamon fern which i fail to
find  i see cows and am afraid   this based on reality of a few days
before   at length by a stone i find a fern coiled as in spring  this
becomes a squirrel  the male comes  and then they are lions  the male has a
sprig of leaves which he lays at the feet of the female and which she eats 
i want to know what the leaves are but fear to look closely because of the
lion  i found it difficult to deliberately influence dreams by suggestion 
the dream self is not to be coerced and usually i over did the matter  most
of my examples deal with flowers and perhaps the most apposite is the
following   i plucked a stem of blossoms of white everlasting and wore it
inside my waist on my bosom all day  asking as i fastened it in   how will
this reappear in my dream   the following morning as consciousness returned 
i had a vision of a baby s bottle filled with milk and beyond it  more
faint  another similar bottle  it is fair to say that this outcome was
entirely unexpected  another night after watching venus  low in the
southwestern sky  i dream that i am molding a statue  strangely enough the
arms as the reference is to the venus de  melos  and the figure is that of a
young woman of immoral life 

my store of dreams is so great and varied that the forms of symbolism are by
no means exhausted   the reception of mail is a favorite subject and here
again one may say that this is the most natural of dreams and quite its own
excuse for being   but strange things come in the mail   pieces of turf in
which are growing tiny plants  boxes of rice  jelly  breakfast food  cooked
fish still warm  and once a sack of mail is emptied upon my door stone  not
by the postman but by a man who the day before drove past with a little
child  other recurring motifs are strawberries  yeast  bologna sausage  ice
cream   once poured over slices of clear  transparent fruit which i eat 
this very plainly referring to the fertilization of the eggs of fish about
which i read the preceding evening    as soon as the female finishes
spawning the male will approach the eggs and eject a milky fluid over them
to effect fertilization  if this is successful the spawn will have a clear 
glassy appearance   the dream self can turn anything to its use   i read of
certain suffrage activities in england and forthwith dream that i attend a
suffrage meeting  but the house at which it is held is in reality the home
of a woman nearly my age  who is pregnant 

i pass over all the dreams obviously of an infantile character  and likewise
those of travelling and of packing for a journey  more unusual is the dream
of a flight of birds which twice occurred under conditions which left no
doubt as to its sexual character  a house having a wet sink and a dry one is
the verdict of my dream self regarding a home in which the woman can bear no
more children because of physical disability  and a railway station where i
go down the steps  pick from the floor a flower  wondering if it is all
right   reach a restaurant in which seventy have that night been served and
where i lose my flower  symbolizes a house of prostitution mentioned in
chicago s famous report where one woman served sixty men in one night and
was said to have seven thousand dollars in the bank  beneath convention
strange unconvention lurks   a young woman of irregular life appears in my
dream as one with soiled skirts  and  very vaguely  some one s else skirts
are soiled also  after seeing a print of tompkins  painting  hester prynne 
heroine of the scarlet letter  i dream that i go to a shop  where i have
great difficulty because of darkness  to buy some dark green silk for
embroidering a letter somewhere on my dress  not to pander to the base in
human nature are these details given but to make known life s realities to
those who are blinded by theories  the frank and honest truth is never foul
and monstrous  society can be renovated only when all the facts are brought
to light 

in conclusion i give the dreams of a single night   first  a drunken man and
girl in the same team  i think they should not be there  then i am on a
porch looking off at a headland with ice at the foot  farther up the hill
are quantities of ice  a sheet of it over the ground and in one place it is
as if water had been poured and allowed to freeze  in the midst of this
last  which is not on the hill  is a fine and shapely tree with the ice
about it very smooth and shining and slanting somewhat  i think it is a good
place for skating   in the morning as i recalled this dream  quite abruptly
into my mind came the remark of philina in wilhelm meister  after seeing a
woman  great with child    it were prettier if we could shake children from
the trees   next i see far off high mountains with sunlight on the summits 
then i am in a porch enclosed by a wire screen  by me is a woman  from the
window of a building outside  which seems to be a hospital without funds  a
woman looks at me   i want to see far off and shade my eyes with my hands 
i think i must cut the screen in order to see clearly  then i see a rampart
and beyond it is the ocean   i hear a bird  a robin  on the rampart   near
it is another bird  large  gray and strange  then it is a rooster   the key
to this dream lies in the fact that the day before i received an appeal for
financial aid from a hospital and the printed request showed the picture of
a row of nurses each with a tiny baby in her lap   finally i go into a
bed room  on the bed is a baby  i uncover it and it moves and cries   it
wants its mother and i go to find her 

that the mind which dreams is not uncognizant of the hopelessness of its
aspirations is strangely indicated by the following for which at the time i
found no direct exciting cause    i see two long lines of seeds planted and
at the end of the rows tiny lettuce plants   near by are apple trees in
blossom  but it is autumn 

bergson at the close of his essay on dreams hints that the mind may
transcend its conjectured limits and be influenced in profound slumber by
telepathy  this is but an hypothesis which must long await verification   my
own dreams which apparently forecast the future are out numbered by
erroneous forecasts and one vivid dream of the death of a friend though
coinciding as to the day  is not of great value as evidence as i had been
expecting the news for weeks  and further  beyond the surface portent the
dream is remotely allied in certain details with more personal and vital
memories 

though the dream process may to a certain extent be made verbally
intelligible he who studies it most best realizes the attendant mystery 
dream self  subconscious ideas  visual images   these are but terms which
bridge the abyss of our ignorance  further exploration of the mystery is of
value not only from the standpoint of pure science  to whose domain there is
no limit  but also in the interest of education  health  sanity and
morality  it is neither necessary nor wise for all persons to study their
dreams  but for those who shape the growing thought and conduct of the world
a knowledge of even the remotest outposts of human mentality is supremely
important 



remarks upon dr  coriat s paper  stammering as a psychoneurosis  1

abnormal psychology  volume ix  no  6  february march  1915 

a criticism

by meyer solomon  m  d   chicago

i have frequently wondered whether those of us who oppose the dissemination
of the freudian theories  at least as they are being and have been applied
to the psychoneuroses and to psychopathology in general  have solved the
problem as we should have solved it or fought the fight as we should have
fought it  it has not infrequently seemed to me that our plan of battle  our
campaign  the battle we have in a way waged  was not as consistently planned
and as well organized as it should have been and as the occasion really
demanded   there were many lines of attack open for us   we could  if we so
wished  have made generalized and wholesale attacks upon all that freudism
stood for regardless of whether  in certain principles  it was right or
wrong   this some have actually done  although this method is not in my
opinion fair or scientific  yet  so reckless and so uncritical have been
many of the freudians  and the foremost freudians at that  in their
declarations and conclusions  that i can readily see how one may be prompted
to resort to unmitigated ridicule and general condemnation of the entire
system  the standpoints and the conclusions that have been made the bulwark
of the freudian movement  others have adopted a different method of dealing
with the situation  they have entirely ignored the freudian school and all
that it stands for  and have permitted the members of this school to go to
ever greater and greater extremes and excesses  with the more extensive
elaboration of their system  so that eventually the error of their ways
would be apparent to all  since the final conclusions to which they would be
led would be openly fallacious and give proof positive that the foundation 
the psychology upon which as a basis the freudian system of interpretation
and analysis has been erected  was defective to such an extent that it would
crumple into disintegrated portions under the heavy load of the unsupported
superstructure  this method has by no manner of means been unsuccessful 

a third standpoint to be assumed is that in which replies to or criticisms
of individual articles  rather than criticisms of a general nature and
applicable to the freudian psychology or method or conclusions in toto  is
adopted as the proper method of dealing with the situation with which we
found ourselves with the advent and spread of the freudian movement  this
last mentioned method is probably the most desirable of the three methods
which have been here mentioned 

and it is the method which i shall follow in this criticism of dr  coriat s
paper  because  among other reasons  i believe it is the fairest to all
concerned 

it is not my purpose to take up for discussion the various statements  made
by dr  coriat  with which i disagree  but rather to consider only the
question of the correctness or incorrectness of the general thesis which he
has presented 

the reasons for my entering into a criticism of this particular article by
dr  coriat may be stated as follows  in the first place i am interested in
the general problems of psychopathology  and of the psychoneuroses in
particular  in the second place i am somewhat unusually interested in the
problem of stuttering  2  this latter interest has two main sources of
origin   1  i am deeply interested in the question of stuttering because of
my general interest in neurology and psychiatry  including the speech
disorders  under which heading stuttering finds its place   2  i have
myself  from earliest childhood  suffered from this affection and so find
myself naturally much interested in the subject 

 2  in this paper i shall use the terms  stammering  and  stuttering 
interchangeably 

it is not out of place  it seems to me  to at once answer one of the stock
arguments which certain freudians have been in the habit of offering as a
reply to those who criticized their theories and conclusions  i refer to the
argument or rather the insistence that those who oppose the spread of the
freudian ideas are themselves unconscious illustrations of the truth and
accuracy and general applicability of the freudian dicta  in this argument
they accuse their opponents of unconsciously indulging in or being victims
of a defense mechanism  as a means of self justification and
self rationalization  based on repression  sexuality  etc   in order that
their hidden  unconscious  repressed  forgotten desires  tendencies and
inclinations may not be brought to the surface and consciously acknowledged 
in other words  in my particular case  my present criticism of dr  coriat s
paper   i could  perhaps  be accused  by those freudians who are in the
habit of resorting to this charge as their own method of self justification
and self rationalization  as the path of least resistance and as a loophole
through which they can escape from meeting the situation presented to them
by a frank self examination and acknowledgment of error or by a fair and
satisfactory response  i could be accused  i repeat  of showing  by the very
fact of my criticism  that all that dr  coriat stated concerning the origin
and nature of stammering was true 

in replying to this oft repeated and oft resurrected assertion  i need not
be detained for any great length of time from proceeding to the
consideration of those facts which are the real purpose of this paper  i
need only say  in parentheses  that it does seem to me that there surely are
a few anti freudians  and i may here include myself  who are perhaps  who
knows  capable of that degree of unprejudiced self criticism and intensive
self analysis which is necessary for the purposes of making ourselves
eligible for candidacy as critics of the freudian theories and dogmata  i
may go further and gently suggest that it even seems to me that there may be
some others of us who are capable of as great a degree of such
self criticism and self analysis as  and it may even be of a greater degree
than  many of those who have been making this claim  i am content to leave
this point to the sound judgment and good sense of the average reader of
these pages 

the second point that i should bring out in this connection is as follows 
that which is of fundamental importance and of basic significance in the
life of the psychoneurotic or the stutterer  that which is the fundamental
and essential motive force which controls the psychoneurotic and the
stutterer is also true  but in greater or less degree  for all of those who
are not within the confines of this group  3  and as a further statement i
must assert that whatever is deemed to be the essential and primary cause
for stuttering must also be applicable  in the same way but in different
degree  to all the other manifestations of speech disorder such as the slips
of the tongue  and many other of the psychopathologic acts of everyday life 
consequently  if the freudian theories of sexuality are directly applicable
to the problem of stuttering  it follows that they must likewise be
applicable to all the other disturbances of speech just referred to   for 
if followed out to the very end  we shall find that the possible mental
content and mental mechanisms are the same for all psychopathologic acts 
whether of everyday life or distinctly abnormal and outside the pale of our
average range  if sexuality lies at the bottom of stuttering  it must be at
the root of all other psychopathologic acts  of whatever nature  of whatever
degree and wherever and whenever found   i cannot devote the time in this
place to enter into an elaborate discussion to prove the truth of this
thesis  but i can gain my point more easily and more directly in another
way  although freud and his followers have not stated  in just so many
words  that the psychopathologic acts of everyday life have the same hidden
mental content that the psychoneuroses have  although it is my contention
that this conclusion is but a natural extension of their sexual theories
concerning the psychoneuroses   yet we do find that freud and the freudian
school in general apply their sexual theories to the whole group of the
psychoneuroses  now  since stuttering is a psychoneurotic disorder of a
certain special type  it is understood that they must believe that
stuttering  as a matter of course  comes within the rubric of their
generalization  as a matter of fact  if their sexual theories were at first
applied only to stuttering  as they were originally applied to hysteria  it
would mean that  by a process of reasoning  the freudian school would have
to apply their dicta to all of the psychoneuroses   this was  in truth  just
what did occur  beginning with hysteria   and it is seen that the same thing
would have happened had they begun with stuttering  i contend  further  but
i shall not endeavor in this place to prove the correctness of my
contention  that what is absolutely and without exception  fundamentally and
essentially true of the psychoneuroses is likewise true  in different
degree  of the psychopathologic acts of every day life  this would be the
conclusion to which i would be forced if i started with any one of the
psychoneuroses  whether it be hysteria or stuttering  one can thus see that
my statement that if freud s theories are true for stuttering they must of
necessity be true for all psychopathologic acts of whatever sort is quite
true  4  i could go much further and prove that if freud s theories were the
primary and basic explanation for stuttering they must be applicable to all
manifestations of human mental energy  which to me would mean that they are
no less true of all vital energy  human or otherwise   in other words  the
solitary application of freud s conception to the problem of stuttering
would lead us  by logical steps  to the ultimate conclusion that the vital
energy was sexual  a conclusion with which jung will not agree   and let us
not forget  too  that the term  sexual  would here be used in a
psychological sense  so that  in fact  freud s theories of sexuality as the
explanation of stuttering would lead us  step by step  to a psychosexual
conception of the universe  and is this not exactly what the freudian school
has assumed 

 3  freud himself agrees that his sexual theories apply to all mankind and
that the psychoneurotic differs from others in not being able to
successfully and completely repress or sublimate the undesirable sexual
trends 

 4  freud himself agrees psycho pathologic acts of everyday life are the
formes frustes of the psychoneuroses and that this shows that we are all
slightly nervous 

i fear that i have not made myself as clear as i should and as i should like
to  but at the risk of being misunderstood  or of not carrying the reader
with me in my argument  i shall not enter into any further discussion of
this aspect   the wider meanings of dr  coriat s paper 

as can be judged from the above remarks  it was no surprise to me to see
such a paper on stuttering as dr  coriat s  to be sure it was tacitly
understood  by those who could read between the lines  that this must be the
belief of the freudian school  since their conclusions were said to be true
of all the psychoneuroses 

i had also known that a few freudians abroad had arrived at conclusions
similar to those presented by dr  coriat  but since  so far as i knew  no
paper along this line had appeared in the english or american journals  i
did not give the subject any serious or special consideration and had not
the slightest idea of refuting the statements   when  however  dr  coriat s
paper appeared  i concluded that it was not out of place for me at this time
to enter into a criticism of these views 

i have felt on many occasions that too many of the statements made by
members of the freudian school have been left unchallenged  with the result
that the views promulgated have received quite widespread dissemination  so
much so that many believe that the sensational and unsupported views which
have come to their ears are accepted as the untarnished truth by most or all
psychopathologists  and were a definitely proven and generally accepted part
of psychopathology   it is therefore not at all surprising to find so many
workers in other fields of medicine who believe that the terms
 psychopathology  and  freudian psychoanalysis  are synonymous  one and the
same thing 

this also is one of the motives which prompts me to write these lines 

i am furthermore impelled by the purely scientific desire for truth and
accuracy  as applied in particular to the problem of stuttering 

and last  but by no means least  i see a serious danger to the community in
the uncritical acceptance and the widespread dissemination of the views
promulgated by the freudian school 

let me assure dr  coriat that i regret very much that i find myself
compelled to take the field against him or rather his paper in this
connection  and that no personalities enter into the question at issue  but
that it is a purely scientific problem  which demands the freest discussion 
from all sides  each of us is entitled to his personal opinions in this
matter  the question of sincerity and honesty of purpose is not at all
breathed  it is purely a matter of  what is the truth  

and it shall be my object in the following brief discussion not to give my
personal views upon this subject  nor even to dissect each and every
statement in dr  coriat s paper with which i find myself at issue  but
merely to show wherein dr  coriat is in most serious error 

i shall confine myself to the question of the application to stammering of
the sexual theories so rampant in freudism   besides  i shall avail myself
of the privilege of giving  in dr  coriat s own words  the gist of his
theory or concept 

 the attempt to repress from consciousness into the unconscious certain
trends of thought or emotions  usually of a sexual nature  is the chief
mechanism in stammering    this is the only place in the article where dr 
coriat expresses any doubt as to the universal validity of his theory for
all cases of stuttering  but i consider this merely as a slip of the tongue
or pen  because in the other portions of the paper the conclusion concerning
the sexual basis of stammering is unqualifiedly made general  and i find
that even on the very next page  at the conclusion of the paragraph of which
the sentence just quoted is the beginning  there occurs the statement that
 the fear in stammering is a deflection of the repressed sexual impulse or
wish   with this beginning dr  coriat proceeds to explain   thus the
repressed thought  because of fear of betrayal  comes in conflict with the
wish to speak and not to betray  the secret through words 5    hence  the
hesitation in speech arises and as the repressed thoughts gradually are
forced into the unconscious  there finally develops the defective speech
automatism  either stammering or a spastic aphonia  this arises in childhood
after the child has learned to speak  

 5  words in parentheses mine but taken from dr  coriat s paper  for
explanatory purposes 

moreover   the hesitation of stammerers on certain words or letters is due
to disturbing complexes   the stammering does not cause the inhibition  it
is the inhibition which is at the bottom of the stammering  

 two types of stimuli lead to stammering  either internal conflicts  or
external instigators which throw these conflicts into activity  the internal
conflicts are either conscious or unconscious fear of betrayal  and
therefore a wish to retain a secret   and this mental attitude leads to the
dread of speaking  a genuine conversion of morbid anxiety into defective
speech        the external stimuli act like dream instigators  for instance
the fear of speaking to relatives or to intimate friends may be based upon
the fear that the unconscious wishes may be discovered and this stimulates
the unconscious anxiety  whereas with strangers  speech is free  because the
dread of discovery is absent  

 thus   says dr  coriat   the beginning of stammering in early childhood    
  is caused by the action of unconscious repressed thoughts upon the speech
mechanism  the repressed thought obtruding itself in speech  

in brief it is contended by dr  coriat that the stammering arises as a
defense or compensation mechanism  the object of which is to keep from
consciousness certain painful memories and undesirable thoughts  in order
that they may not be betrayed in speech   in fact  as dr  coriat says   all
stammering  with its hesitation  its fear  its disturbing emotions  is a
kind of an association test in everyday life and not a phonetic disturbance 
it is a situation phobia  the same as phobias of open or closed places  

consequently  according to this view  stammering is purposeful and
intentional and not accidental   this purposiveness is psychological and
individualistic   it is resorted to by the individual for very definite 
intimate  personal reasons  it is due to unconscious  repressed hidden
complexes which crowd or press between the words of syllables  as stekel
puts it  and which produce the inner resistance which inhibit the free flow
of speech 

it is asserted that these hidden  repressed  unconscious thoughts are
related to the sexual impulse or wish 

dr  coriat enumerates the types of repressed complexes in childhood which
may bring about stammering as follows 

1   repression of sexual acts or secrets and the fear of betrayal   2 
typical oedipus complexes  with a fear of betrayal of the hate for the
father and a consequent embarrassment of speech in his presence   3 
masochistic phantasies  wondering and imitating how it would sound to talk
with the tongue cut out   4   the fear of pronouncing or saying certain
sexual and  therefore  tabooed words  and thus betraying what the child
thinks  his hidden thoughts 

the stammering may then arise as a wish to say or think certain tabooed
words and the wish encounters a prohibition from within  these words may
relate to certain anal  urinary or sexual functions which are recognized by
the child as unclean  and thus forbidden to pronounce   5   as a
manifestation of anal eroticism  that is  holding the feces so that he could
talk while trying to conceal the act 

    talking at these times would be difficult  because talking would take
away the muscular tension for withholding the feces  

at another place dr  coriat assures us that  the dreams of stammerers are
interesting because these dreams reveal their wishes to talk freely  their
resistances and transferences and  also  their reversions to childhood when
the stammering arose as an embarrassment complex or as a gainer of time to
conceal their sexual thoughts or libido  

i have presented dr  coriat s views so fully and quoted him so much at
length in order that there may not be any question of the absolute accuracy
of my statements 

what does this mean to the one who has followed the trail of the freudian
movement   the meaning is plain  it is like the handwriting on the wall 
dr  coriat has permitted himself to be deluded by the freudian sexual
theories and their application to the psychoneuroses  and in this special
instance to stammering 

what does this imply   it implies that dr  coriat accepts the freudian
theories en masse   hence  to discuss this subject in a thorough way i
should have to take up for discussion the various aspects of freudian
psychoanalysis   this would include a consideration of the method employed 
the psychology  the attitude or standpoint assumed  the  art of
interpretation  developed  and the real meanings  in their wider and more
extended sense  of various unsupported  unfounded  dogmatic and untrue
conclusions of a theoretical and practical nature  this cannot  it is
obvious  be expected in this place  attempts of a certain sort in this
direction have been made by me in previous communications  6  in the not
very distant future i shall endeavor more successfully to cope with some of
the problems mentioned 

 6  see  for example  the psychoanalytic review  january 1915 and the
journal of abnormal psychology  june september  1914 

with respect to the general problem of sexuality i may say that i have
recently 7  taken up  for separate dissection  the conception of sexuality
assumed by freud and his followers   the present paper should  i feel  be
read in connection with this particular paper  since it will  in a way 
clear the field of many of the misunderstandings in interpretation 
everything depends upon what one means by  sexuality  or  sexual impulse  or
 sexual tendency    unless a mutual understanding is arrived at on this
subject of sexuality  little advance toward the dissipation of conflicting
views of freudians and anti freudians can ever be had  and permit me to
mention in this place that it is the freudians themselves and not their
opponents who are most to blame  until the freudian school decidedly and
once for all gives up its false and distorted viewpoint of man s sexual
impulse and of human mental life  little progress of a worth while nature
can be made by them  8 

 7   a critical review of the conception of sexuality assumed by the
freudian school    medical record  march 27  1915 

 8  owing to the fixed  systematized theories of the freudian school  i
believe that little co operation can be expected from it   we can only
prevent the dissemination of their dangerous sexual theories 

starting out  then  with certain concepts or theories which are basically
wrong and can be summed up by stating that they assume an individualisitic 
psychosexual conception of life and interpretation of vital phenomena  and
with a psychology and a sexology which is radically wrong in its sweeping
and dogmatic conclusions  dr  coriat  who has obviously accepted these
theories as actualities  else he could not have arrived at the ideas
concerning stammering which he presents in his paper  builds up or accepts
an imaginatively constructed theory which he applies in full force to the
problem of stuttering  and into which he crowds the phenomena of a physical
and mental order which are manifest in this intermittent  special
psychoneurotic disorder  as a natural consequence all the faults of freudism
have been transported to the elucidation of the genesis  nature and
evolution of stammering  and this means that the theories of universally
acting psychical repression  of the unconscious  of the endopsychic censor 
of the significance of resistance and amnesia  of the employment of highly
complicated and phantastic symbolism  of the manifestations of sexuality and
so forth have been made use of in a high handed  uncalled for  unnecessary
and unscientific manner to prove the truth of the thesis with which the
author set out upon his journey 

it is no wonder that in such a fashion and with such concepts the
conclusions above cited were arrived at   indeed  work along this line was
unnecessary  except in a purposively corroborative way  if the theories of
freud in the case of the whole group of psychoneuroses is once seized upon
and accepted as the basic truth  the problem for dr  coriat is to prove the
truth of freud s conceptions as laid down in his psychology and sexology 
upon which his psychopathology is built 

i must stoutly protest against an evasion of the real issues by the leaders
of the freudian movement   let them retrace their steps and first prove the
truth  soundness and validity of their psychological and sexual theories and
cease pressing on to pastures new  as dr  coriat has done here in the case
of stuttering  if they are not prepared to do this  or are unwilling so to
do  i do not believe that they are entitled to continue to inflict upon
others views which have little real foundation in fact  which are unproven 
unfounded  purely speculative  imaginative  pure figments of the
imagination  a delusion and a snare  i have elsewhere 9  given credit to
freud and his co workers where i think they deserve it   but that should not
deter me from protesting against their evasion of the issues  their
befogging of the problems involved  their failure to prove their case or to
offer satisfactory replies to criticism which is given in a fair and frank
fashion 

 9   a plea for a broader standpoint in psychoanalysis   psychoanalytic
review  january  1915 

the method of burying one s head in sand  after the manner of the ostrich 
and the refusal to see that which is pointed out or which stares one clearly
in the face  cannot go far to establish one s case or as a method of
defense  and the same thing applies to that oft repeated and tiresome
retort   you do not  or perhaps you cannot  understand our theories and
viewpoints   or that other evasive accusation  rather than reply    your
lack of understanding is of itself proof positive that our theories are
absolutely correct in every detail    or  your attack or criticism just
completely and undoubtedly proves our case   you are prompted by those very
mental mechanisms and by that self same mental content  meaning all the time
the sexual content and sexual mechanisms  which we have been trying to
explain to you so that you might understand us  

in response to this i should like to ask the freudian school what it means
by  censor    wish    unconscious    sexual   and other similar and
constantly used terms which form the stronghold of their defenses  i have
shown  10  at least to my own satisfaction  that the conception of sexuality
is not at all clear to any of the freudian school  including freud himself 
this should by no means be so  surely the terms which are constantly used
and are the sine qua non of their theories should have a definite meaning of
some sort  at least to the freudians themselves  mystical and metaphysical
implications should not continue to find a sheltering place in the province
of psychopathology  they should be uprooted and driven forth from the dark
and hidden recesses into the light and open highways 

 10  loc   cit 

these statements have a direct application to the paper which i have
undertaken to criticize   it is all very well and very commendable to come
forward with new theories  they are entertaining  interesting and make one
think  even if they are not at all true   but it should be definitely and
plainly stated that we are dealing with theories and not with facts  that
the theories will be considered theories until they are proven to be facts 
and that if they are disproven  they should be thrown into the rubbish heap
or discarded  or else they should be modified to meet with the facts and
actual conditions  as they are and not as they ought in our opinion to be or
as we should like them or as we imagine them to be  here we are confronted
with a problem  stammering  which has been the subject of much study and
discussion by many men  theories have been carefully and guardedly
formulated by most workers in this field   many of them were  it is true  in
error in their conclusions or viewpoints   they were  as it were  on the
wrong trail 

here is a problem of the greatest interest and of the greatest importance  
one which should demand the most careful research and the most positive
deliberation and consideration  with prolonged and intensive study and
observation of cases  combined with self scrutiny and self analysis and
self knowledge  which means a keen insight into human nature and the human
mind in its manifold workings   here is a serious  concrete problem of great
practical importance   its solution and elucidation means much  and he who
comes forward with an explanation of this problem should be expected to give
conclusive proof of his conception and for his conclusion  and we should 
justly and as a matter of course  expect and demand it 

and what proof has dr  coriat given us for his conclusions  here and there
scattered through his paper one finds a few conclusions or explanations of a
concrete nature  but they are his interpretations of the facts and not the
facts  no real  in fact not a vestige of proof is offered   the few dreams
which he presents do not  to the inquiring and demanding reader  show
anything which permit of the conclusions which dr  coriat draws with
reference to their meaning or significance  he seems to have interpretated
 rather than analyzed  them in typical freudian fashion   and  furthermore 
even if his interpretations of the few dreams which he presents and which
were taken from different cases were true  of what significance would that
be  what right would we thus have of drawing conclusions which apply to all
cases of stuttering  and  as mentioned earlier in this paper  to many other
related states of a normal and abnormal nature   not the slightest 

not a single case has been presented in proof of the conclusions drawn in
the paper   surely this is not what we have been accustomed to expect in
other fields of medicine  especially when the conception newly put forth is
entirely novel  sensational  revolutionary  contrary to all former beliefs 
and based on theories and conclusions which have been for some time and
still are a centre of storm  of wordy argumentation  and even of insult and
abuse  at any rate sub judice 

has the science and practice of psychopathology come to the stage when
theories of any sort can be given to the reading public as fact  and no
actual proof therefor presented 

i venture to say that in no other department of medicine or in fact in no
other aspect of life would scientific men tolerate such presentation and
promulgation  despite opposition and disproof and with no tangible or
definite evidence or proof  nor would men come forward to offer
revolutionary  let alone dangerous theories  for general consumption  with
so little proof  as is being laid on the platter for psychopathologists 

i find no evidence offered by dr  coriat to bolster up the conclusions of
his paper 

in response to a question asked by one of those who discussed his paper in
which he was requested to explain how he knew that stammering begins by
concealing something  dr  coriat stated   i have had an opportunity of
examining a number of stammerers and subjecting them to a complete
psychoanalysis  studying all the paradoxical mental reactions and in nearly
every case this concealment of some sexual secret of childhood came up  it
is easy to establish a certain relationship between the speech embarrassment
and the concealed sexuality  

there is  as is seen  no other proof for this theory  that is all that one
call it  of dr  coriat and the freudian school in general  than his or their
say so  those who are acquainted with the method of arriving at conclusions
adopted by the freudian school will demand more than this as proof of either
the  concealment  of some  sexual secret  of childhood  and where lives
there a man or woman that has not sexual memories  not necessarily secrets 
of some sort or other  related to the period of puberty or antedating it by
a certain varying period   or the establishment of a relationship other than
co existence or coincidence  between the speech embarrassment and the
 concealed sexuality   just as if even proof of the existence of this
relationship was sufficient testimony of the causative operating influence
of the latter  

i could discuss dr  coriat s paper from many angles  and in each case show
that its conclusions were not only unsupported but impossible  11  but in
the above remarks i have presented sufficient evidence  i believe  to carry
out the objects of this criticism 

 11  the ideas in the paper are  in fact  absurd   if definite  practical 
clinical issues were not involved matters might be different  but the
situation is serious yes  dangerously antisocial  since the practical
application of these theories to human beings is the point of greatest
interest 

the reader should not lose sight of the cold but important fact that the
application of freud s sexual theories to stammering in children is  in my
humble opinion  fraught with the greatest danger   i cannot do otherwise
than look upon this as positively anti social  it would  it is my belief  be
a glaring and rife source of danger to the community and to society in
general for these ideas to be spread broadcast  freud himself has shown that
the child  before puberty  with his more or less undifferentiated sexual
impulse  may be swept along into any one or more of the sexual aberrations
or to intrafamilial sexuality  these goals exist only as possibilities and
should not  i contend  be referred to as predispositions or tendencies
 almost as if they were instincts   the direction of the child s thought
along this line before or at or after puberty may prove disastrous in one or
more of many different ways 

think of hinting at or talking about or harping upon matters of this sort to
children  let alone to adults of the usual sort   it would be nothing less
than a crime to society  to the family and to the growing child  in this
respect i look upon the application of the freudian theories as a distinct
and glaring danger to the individual  to the family and to the community 

efforts to stem the tide from flowing in this direction should be
unfettered  it means much for humanity 

even hinting  to the children  in a remote way about the various aspects of
sexuality described by the freudian school should not find its place and has
no place in treating stammering per se in children 

think of the effect of continual conversation and thinking of this sort upon
a child at or before puberty  or at adolescence  or even upon an individual
in adult life  his thoughts are continually drifted to his urogenital organs
and the sexual possibilities of all sorts of human relationships 
intrafamilial as well as extrafamilial 

the freudians may object to any statements to the effect that they tell
their patients about these sexual theories   i find jones  12  for instance 
declares that freud  deliberately withholds from his patients all knowledge
of psychoanalyses except what they discover for themselves   even granting
this  the patient doesn t have to wait long or think much before he does
discover for himself just what the freudians mean 

 12  ernest jones   professor janet on psychoanalysis  a rejoinder  journal
of abnormal psychology  feb  mar   1915  p  407 

but freud 13  himself contradicts this statement by jones when he says   if
with my patients i emphasize the frequency of the oedipus dream  of having
sexual intercourse with one s own mother  i get the answer   i cannot
remember such a dream    immediately afterwards  however  there arises
recollection of another disguised and indifferent dream  which has been
dreamed repeatedly by the patient  and the analysis shows it to be a dream
of this same content  that is  another oedipus dream

then again  listen to brill  14   with reference to the question of
determining that a person is homosexual 

 14  the conception of homosexuality  journal of american medical
association  august 2  1913  see brill s discussion on pages 339 340 

 a patient came to me who was said to have nothing the matter with his
sexual life  but who had convulsions  i had seen him not more than three
times when i said to him   you are homosexual   and i explained what i
meant  he told me that while at college he never indulged in sexual acts 
and that for this reason he used to wrestle  during which he would have
ejaculation  and he selected his partners  unquestionably from the beginning
of his existence he was homosexual  although he was able to have sexual
intercourse with his wife  but he was compelled to marry when quite young 
he was  prodded into it   as he said   he came to me to be treated for
neurosis  but the neurosis was simply the result of homosexual lack of
gratification 

 we should be particularly careful not to suggest anything  i never tell a
patient that he is homosexual   be reasonably sure that he is homosexual and
you need not hesitate to tell him so  

it all depends on what one means by  reasonably sure  or what kind of and
how much evidence one requires or demands to be  reasonably sure  

furthermore the mass of popular freudian literature is not by any means
hidden from the patient 

in conclusion i may remind the members of the freudian school that it
behooves them to undergo that same self analysis and self scrutiny which
they justly advise others to have  if they do this in a truly critical and
impartial way they will find that the opposition which they have met has not
been without foundation  they will find that there are serious and
all pervading flaws in their psychology and sexology  and that this is
responsible for their one sided and distorted analyses and interpretations 
most of the trouble will be found in the method of interpretation  flowing
out of their attitude   they will find that they have been advocating a
system of theories and conclusions which have been followed as a religion  a
cult  a creed  and they will correct the errors which are so patent to so
many of the rest of us 

it is or should be evident to him who reads between the lines and surveys
this question as from a mountain top  that there is not the slightest proof 
not one jot of testimony in support of the ideas which dr  coriat has given
us in his paper 

as a final word i cannot refrain from remarking that it will be a sad day
for humanity and for society when psychoneurotics of whatever sort 
stammerers  normal individuals with their psychopathologic acts of everyday
life  and all the rest of us  particularly children  shall be subjected to
freudian psychoanalyses  with the numerous sexual theories and sexual
implications with regard to everything of vital or human concern  as seen
especially in family and social relations  a study of the origin  nature and
evolution of these is not only not out of place  but on the other hand finds
a distinct place of honor for purely scientific purposes   theories  however
unfounded and untrue  may  not inappropriately  be offered for this purpose 
but we come upon a decidedly different situation when we have to deal in a
practical sort of way with individuals  particularly children  who are the
objects of the experimental application of full blown theories  especially
is this so in the case of sexual theories 

propagation of such views concerning the origin and nature of stammering as
are presented to us in dr  coriat s paper should be sternly discountenanced 
nay more  they should be unflinchingly denied and even severely condemned 
i  for one  protest vigorously against the propagation of such views 
especially when they represent nothing more than an inflated theory 

the writer wishes to assure dr  coriat and the reader that his remarks are
intended in a thoroughly impersonal sort of way  he is concerned only with
the problems involved  personalities do not at all enter into the
proposition  he hopes that his criticism will be accepted in the same spirit
in which it is given   if  to the reader  it may seem at times that the
writer has spoken too strongly  he can only say in defense that he has
seized upon this occasion as the time and the place to so express himself
briefly  frankly but without malice  the situation more than demands such
outspoken expression of opinion

the psychic factors in mental disorder   milton a  harrington  am   jour  of
insanity   vol   lxxi  no  4  p  691 

the writer has taken the scheme of the instincts which william mcdougall has
given in his book  entitled  an introduction to social psychology  and has
attempted to show how it may be used in studying the problems of mental
disorder   the paper falls into three parts  in the first part mcdougall s
conception is presented  modified  however  so that it may be better fitted
to the needs of the psychiatrist  briefly it is as follows 

man has instincts as well as the animals and all his mental activity is due
to impulses coming from these instincts  an instinct may be defined as an
innate specific tendency of the mind which is common to all members of any
one species and which impels the individual to react to certain definite
kinds of stimuli with certain definite types of conduct  without having
first learned from experience the need of such conduct  for example  there
is an instinct of pugnacity which impels us to attack that which injures us
or interferes in any way with the attainment of our desires  an instinct of
flight which impels us to seek escape from danger  a parental instinct from
which come the impulses that lead us to protect and care for our young 
but  beside impelling the individual to react to certain definite kinds of
stimuli with certain definite types of conduct  an instinct  when
stimulated  gives rise in every case to an emotion which is characteristic
of it  for example  with the instinct of pugnacity  we have the emotion of
anger  with that of flight  the emotion of fear  with the parental instinct 
the emotion of love or tender feeling  an instinct  therefore  is regarded
as a mechanism made up of three parts 

first  an afferent or cognitive part  through which it is stimulated 

second  an affective part through which it gives rise to the emotion which
is characteristic of it 

third  an efferent or conative part through which it gives rise to a
characteristic type of conduct 

mcdougall gives a list of about twelve instincts  each with its accompanying
emotion   these he regards as primary and the source of all thought and
action 

considering the instincts from the standpoint of evolution  one may assume
that they first developed in extremely low forms of life in order to produce
the few and simple reactions of which animals low in the scale are capable 
one might almost say in regard to such primitive organisms  that for each
situation an instinct is provided and the situation calls forth its
appropriate reaction almost as automatically as the pressing of an electric
button causes the ringing of a bell   but  as animals rise higher in the
scale  the kinds of conduct required become more varied and complex  for
example  an impulse from the flight or fear instinct  in the lower animals 
will always produce some simple reaction such as flight or concealment 
but  in man  the forms of conduct  to which it gives rise  may be extremely
varied  thus in one case a man may be impelled to run away  in another to
work hard at some disagreeable task in order to escape the harm which might
result if he failed to do so  this capacity to direct the instinctive forces
into various forms of activity  we call the capacity for adjustment and we
may assume that it depends upon the operation of certain mechanisms which we
may call the mechanisms of adjustment  the mind may  therefore  be regarded
as made up of certain instincts from which come the impulses that give rise
to all our mental reactions and certain mechanisms of adjustment by which
these impulses are directed into the most useful forms of activity 

this conception of the human mind enables us to form some idea of how a
mental disorder may arise from purely mental causes  for it is obvious that
conditions may sometimes arise when the mechanisms of adjustment will prove
inadequate to the demands made upon them  when they will be unable to
control the instinctive forces or find for them satisfactory outlet and  as
a result  these impulses will escape by undesirable channels  giving rise to
forms of thought and action which we recognize to be abnormal  to show that
this theory may be successfully applied to explain the facts of abnormal
psychology  the analysis of an illustrative case is presented   this case 
which is worked out in considerable detail  forms the second section of the
paper  it is the case of a young man who  partly owing to inherited
tendencies and partly to environment  developed during early life certain
habits and characteristics which  when he approached maturity and the sexual
instinct awoke to its full activity  caused the impulses from this instinct
to be directed into wrong channels  giving rise to a psychosis which took
the form of a catatonic stupor 

the conception of mental disorder here presented inevitably leads to certain
views regarding the causes which give rise to it  since mental health is
dependent on capacity for adjustment being equal to the demands made upon
it  mental disorder must always be due to failure to maintain this
relationship between capacity and needs  the causes of insanity must
therefore be of two kinds 

first  those which make the task of adjustment so difficult as to overtax
the capacity 

second  those which lessen the capacity so that it is unequal to the demands
made upon it 

the third section of the paper is a brief discussion of what these causes
are and how we should deal with them   author s abstract 



a study of sexual tendencies in monkeys and baboons   by g  v  hamilton 
journal of animal behavior  september october  1914  vol  4  no  5  pp 
295 318 

the writer asserts that the work and problems in sexuality in human beings
place upon the animal behaviorist an obligation to lay the necessary
foundations for a scientific and thoroughly comprehensive investigation of
sexual life   this has led him to formulate the following two problems in
animal behavior   1  are there any types of infra human primate behavior
which cannot be regarded as expressions of a tendency to seek sexual
satisfaction  but which have the essential objective characteristics of
sexual activity   2  do such sexual reaction types as homosexual
intercourse  efforts to copulate with non primate animals and masturbation
normally occur among any of the primates  and if so  what is their
biological significance 

the author presents a list of the subjects  monkeys and baboons  employed in
his study  gives a description of the environmental conditions in his
laboratory which is in the midst of a live oak woods in montecito 
california  about five miles from santa barbara  gives a list of the types
of situations that were arranged by the observer or encountered by the
subjects in consequence of their spontaneous activities  and under each
description of a typical situation one or more detailed descriptions of
typical responses thereto  and finally offers the classification of sexual
tendencies as expressions of reactive tendencies observed 

the author then enters into a discussion of the use of the term reactive
tendency  and explains that this term  according to his definition  is meant
to explain something more specific than an inclination to direct activity
toward one of a limited number of general ends  and to include both the
innate and the acquired features of an individual s reactive mechanism 

he then presents his conclusions which i shall here include in full and
verbatim  because of the fact that these findings should prove of great
importance  especially in the light of freud s theories of infantile
sexuality   the author states that  at least two  and possibly three 
different kinds of hunger  or needs of individual satisfaction  normally
impel the macaque toward the manifestation of sexual behavior  viz   hunger
for sexual satisfaction  hunger for escape from danger and  possibly  hunger
for access to an enemy 

 homosexual behavior is normally an expression of tendencies which come to
expression even when opportunities for heterosexual intercourse are present 
sexually immature male monkeys appear to be normally impelled toward
homosexual behavior by sexual hunger  the fact that homosexual tendencies
come to less frequent expression in the mature than in the immature male
suggests the possibility that in their native habitat these animals may
wholly abandon homosexual behavior  except as a defensive measure   on
arriving at sexual maturity 

 homosexual behavior is of relatively frequent occurrence in the female when
she is threatened by another female  but it is rarely manifested in response
to sexual hunger 

 masturbation does not seem to occur under normal conditions 

 the macaque of both sexes is apt to display sexual excitement in the
presence of friendly or harmless non primates 

 it is possible that the homosexual behavior of young males is of the same
biological significance as their mock combats  it is clearly of value as a
defensive measure in both sexes  homosexual alliances between mature and
immature males may possess a defensive value for immature males  since it
insures the assistance of an adult defender in the event of an attack

an experimental study of stuttering   by john madison fletcher  american
journal of psychology  april  1914  vol  xxv  pp  201 255 

this paper is a dissertation submitted to the faculty of clark university 
worcester  mass   in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree
of doctor of philosophy   it is thus from the psychological laboratory of
clark university 

this interesting study of fletcher includes some general remarks in the
introduction  the question of differentiation and definition  the
physiological aspects  including breathing  vocalization  articulation and
accessory movements   psychophysical changes  including volumetric changes 
changes in heart rate and galvanic changes   a consideration of the
interpretation of the results  the psychological relations  including
emotions  attitudes  imagery  responsibility for aufgabe  psychoanalysis 
and association   heredity and conclusions   a valuable bibliography is
added  and seven illustrative plates complete the paper 

fletcher would reserve the word  stammering  for mispronunciation or
incorrect speech  this stutter being anatomical  due to malformation of one
or more organs of articulation  or developmental  due to incorrect
functioning of the organs of articulation resulting in certain cases of
immaturity  such as lisping   stammering  in this sense  is of no
psychological interest  the reviewer is in favor of employing the terms
 stammering  and  stuttering  synonymously  as is the practice in england
and america   the writer  fletcher  finds that he cannot accept the freudian
interpretation of stuttering which has been offered by a number of different
members of that school 

although the entire paper is of interest and of value to the student of
psychopathology  the purposes of this review can best be served by citing
the following conclusions of the author   the motor manifestations of
stuttering are found to consist of asynergies in the three musculatures of
speech  breathing  vocalization and articulation  certain accessory
movements  which tend to become stereotyped in each individual and which
consist of tonic and clonic conditions of other muscles not involved in
normal speech  accompany these asynergies  the type of asynergy and more
particularly of accessory movements differ so widely that it is impossible
to state that any special form of breathing  or articulation  or of
vocalization is the fundamental factor in stuttering  disturbances of pulse
rate  of blood distribution and in psychogalvanic variations  appearing
before  during and after the speaking interval  and the intensity of which
varies approximately with the severity of the stuttering  accompany the
motor manifestations of stuttering  the essential condition in stuttering is
the complex state of mind  the quality rather than the intensity of these
feeling states governing the rise of stuttering   such feeling states as
fear  anxiety  dread  shame  embarrassment  in fact  those feelings that
tend toward inhibition and repression  are most likely to precede
stuttering  and probably operate in a vicious circle as both cause and
effect  the permanent condition of nervousness thought to be characteristic
of stutterers should be regarded as effect rather than cause  the states of
feeling that have to do with the production of stuttering vary in degree
from strong emotions to mere attitudes or moods  the latter being often so
slight in degree that it is difficult for the subject to report their
presence   stuttering also seems to be affected by the quality of mental
imagery  by attention and by association  the affective and emotional
experiences associated with the pronunciation of sounds rather than the
nature of the sounds themselves determine the rise of stuttering   the
author s final remarks are    stuttering  therefore  seems to be essentially
a mental phenomenon in the sense that it is due to and dependent upon
certain variations in mental state  hence the study of stuttering becomes a
specifically psychological problem  and it seems evident that a detailed
analysis of all the various aspects of the phenomena of stuttering will
furnish important contributions to general psychology    meyer solomon 



reviews

the foundations of character   by a  f  shand   macmillan and company 
london  1914   pp  xxx  532 

in his preface the author says    a great difficulty which i have found in
the course of my work has been to collect the facts or observations of
character on which i had to rely   such material as i have obtained has been
drawn much more from literature than from any other source  and this was
inevitable  because psychology has hardly begun to concern itself with these
questions   this reproach levelled against psychology rebounds on the
author  for throughout the book he shows himself evidently unacquainted with
those branches of psychology  notably the medical ones  that have
contributed so brilliantly and extensively to the science of characterology 
it need hardly be pointed out  further  that to rely on second hand
material  which cannot be checked  analysed  or immediately studied  as the
living facts can is a procedure that is open to insuperable objections 

the author repudiates any analytical approach to his problems  preferring
what he terms  a concrete and synthetic conception of character   and so
 avoids breaking up the forces of character into their elements  and being
driven to consider the abstract problem of their mutual relation   his
method consists in assuming the existence of these forces  as part of his
working hypothesis  and in formulating general laws based on a study of
them   as he himself puts it   it is in the first place a method of
discovery rather than of proof   a method reaching no further than a
tentative formulation of laws  for organising the more particular under the
more general  for interpreting the generalised observations which every
great observer of human nature forms for himself  and by this interpretation
making some advance towards their organization   it follows from this that
the book is predominantly descriptive in nature  and in this field it must
be said that the author has accomplished great work  one that will be of
almost indispensable value to future students of the various emotions 

the book is really a study of the emotions rather than of character  and so
we have to pay special attention to what the author has to say concerning
them   as is well known  he formulated some years ago a special
conception  it can hardly be called a theory  of the emotions  and the most
novel part of the present work is the way in which this conception is
expounded and elaborated in detail  he rejects the usual sense of the term
in which it is taken to express a certain degree of elaboration of the
affective aspect of the mind  and adopts a much wider definition in which
the conative  affective  and cognitive aspects are all represented 
  emotion  for us will connote not feeling abstracted from impulse  but
feeling with its impulse  and feeling which has essentially a cognitive
attitude  however vague  and frequently definite thoughts about its object  
he distinguishes  none the less  between an emotion and the entire system to
which it belongs  it is the part of the system that is present in
consciousness  there being two other parts that are not  namely  the
processes connected with it in the body  and the executive part concerned
with its outward expression and modes of behaviour   the three main primary
emotions are fear  anger  and disgust  other are curiosity  joy  sorrow 
self display  and self abasement  the four emotional systems of anger  fear 
joy and sorrow have an innate connection not only with one another  but also
with every other primary system  most of the book is taken up with a very
detailed study of the emotions just enumerated  and in this study the author
insists on the functional point of view  constantly enquiring into the
dynamic aspects and tendencies of the emotion under consideration  this is
perhaps the only respect in which it could be seen that the book was written
within the last forty years 

mr  shand s view of the relation between the emotions and the instincts has
led to an animated controversy with dr  mcdougall  published in the
proceedings of the aristotelian society for 1914 1915  according to the
latter writer  every emotion has a corresponding instinct  and is merely the
affective aspect of this instinct   mr  shand  on the contrary  holds that
there are vastly more instincts than emotions  that a given instinct may
enter into several different emotional systems  and that each emotional
system may at various times  and according to its needs  make use of almost
any number of different instincts  the reviewer is unable to determine
whether these different points of view have any further implications than a
difference in the definitions adopted by the two writers   mcdougall
obviously employs the term instinct in a much more comprehensive and
inclusive sense than shand does 

in the discussion of this interrelation there occurs  by the way  the
following suggestive passage    there are no fears so intense as those which
arise in situations from which we cannot escape  where we are forced to
remain in contemplation of the threatening events  there is no anger so
intense as when the blood boils and all the sudden energy that comes to us
cannot vent itself on our antagonist  the arrest of an instinct is that
which most frequently excites the emotion connected with it  and therefore
we feel the emotion so often before  or after   reviewer  the instinctive
behaviour takes place  rather than along with it    this seems to
after shadow the modern views on intrapsychical conflict and abreaction 

another conception peculiar to the author  first propounded in 1896  is that
regarding the sentiments   sentiments  in the author s sense  are  those
greater systems of the character the function of which is to organize
certain of the lesser systems of emotions by imposing on them a common end
and subjecting them to a common cause   a constant conflict seems to go on
between the organizing tendency of these sentiments and the tendency of the
constituent emotions to achieve freedom and autonomous action  a conception
quite in harmony with the modern views of  complex action   although shand s
 sentiments  are far from being synonymous with either  complexes  or
 constellations  in our sense   the implications that follow from his
conception of the sentiments  and the importance he attaches to it  are well
shown by the following interesting passages   the result of the modification
which the systems of the emotions undergo in man  and especially the
multiplication of the causes which excite and sustain them  is  1  to make
man the most emotional of animals  and  2  to render possible the debasement
of his character  for that which is a condition of his progress is also a
condition of his decline   the acquired power of ideas over emotions  and
the subsequent power of each indefinitely to sustain the other  hence the
existence of the emotions constitutes a serious danger for him though not
for the animals  and the balance which is lost when the emotions are no
longer exclusively under the control of those causes which originally excite
them can only be replaced by the higher control of the sentiments  there are
then three stages in the evolution of emotional systems  the first and
primitive  in which they are under the control of the stimuli innately
connected with their excitement  undergoing a certain change through
individual experience  but not radically altered  the second  in which they
become dangerous and independent systems  the third  in which they are
organized under the control of the new systems which they are instrumental
in developing    there are three principal stages in the development of
character  its foundations are those primary emotional systems  in which the
instincts play at first a more important part than the emotions  in them 
and as instrumental to their ends  are found the powers of intelligence and
will to which the animal attains  but even in animals there is found  some
inter organization of these systems  or  at least  some balance of their
instincts  by which these are fitted to work together as a system for the
preservation of their offspring and of themselves  this inter organization
is the basis of those higher and more complex systems which  if not peculiar
to man  chiefly characterize him  and which we have called the sentiments 
and this is the second stage  but character  if more or less rigid in the
animals  is plastic in man   and thus the sentiments come to develop  for
their own more perfect organization  systems of self control  in which the
intellect and will rise to a higher level than is possible at the emotional
stage  and give rise to those great qualities of character that we name
 fortitude    patience    steadfastness    loyalty   and many others  and a
relative ethics that is in constant interaction with the ethics of the
conscience  which is chiefly imposed upon us through social influences  and
this is the third and highest stage in the development of character  and the
most plastic  so that it is in constant flux in each of us  and the worth
that we ascribe to men in review of their lives  deeper than their outward
success or failure  is determined by what they have here accomplished  

we have given some indication of the positive side of the book  one which
deserves great praise for both its matter and style  on the negative side we
have to remark on the following important omissions  as was mentioned to
start with  no acquaintance whatever is shown with either the methods or
findings of what may broadly be called medical psychology  the only
psychology that has at its disposal the material on which a science of
character could be founded  that the important work of klarges on
characterology is not considered may be accounted for by the fact that there
is not a single german reference given in the whole book   in the second
place  the genetic point of view is almost completely overlooked  one of
cardinal importance in such a field   thirdly  the whole subject of the
unconscious is treated as non existent  it is a complete misnomer to entitle
a book on descriptive psychology  the foundations of character  when no
notice whatever is taken of that region of the mind where the very springs
of character take their source  and where the most fundamental features of
character are to be found   last  but not least  is the absence of any study
of the sexual instinct and emotions  surely of cardinal importance for any
investigation of character  apart from the general contributions made by
this instinct to character  one thinks of such clearly cut pictures as the
masochistic  voyeur  and anal types of character 

an inadequate index closes an unsatisfactory  though in many respects
valuable  book   we note no fewer than twelve references to  seneca   but
none to  sex  or  shame   sixteen to hudson  but none to freud  janet 
prince  adler  or klarges   ernest jones 



an introduction to social psychology   by william mcdougall   published by
john w  luce   co   boston  1910 

although this book was published a few years ago  nevertheless it seems
sufficiently important to the reviewer to have it brought prominently before
psychopathologists 

in the introduction mcdougall reminds us that the instincts are the prime
movers  the mental forces  the sources of energy  the springs of human
action  the impulses and motives which determine the goals and course of all
human activity  mental and physical   these instincts  being the fundamental
elements of our constitution  must be clearly defined  and their history in
the individual and the race determined  for this purpose  comparative and
evolutionary psychology is necessary  for the life of the emotions and the
play of motives in mental life are the least susceptible of introspective
observation and description   the old psychologising   says mcdougall   was
like playing  hamlet  with the prince of denmark left out  or like
describing steam engines while ignoring the fact of the presence and
fundamental role of the fire or other sources of heat    a knowledge of the
constitution of the mind of man is a prerequisite for any understanding of
the life of society in any or all of its many aspects   and this applies to
psychopathology  i venture to assert that had certain individuals read and
digested a book of this sort it might have been a prophylactic against an
exclusively sexual conception of human conduct 

the work is divided into two sections   section one deals with the mental
characteristics of man of primary importance for his life in society  while
section two is concerned with the operation of the primary tendencies of the
human mind in the life of societies   the successive chapters of the first
section take up in order the following questions  the nature of instincts
and their place in the constitution of the mind  the principal instincts and
the primary emotions of man  some general or non specific innate tendencies 
the nature of the sentiments and the constitution of some of the complex
emotions  the development of the sentiments  the growth of
self consciousness and of the self regarding sentiment  the advance to the
higher plane of social conduct  and volition  in the second section the
author considers the reproductive and the parental instincts  the instinct
of pugnacity  the gregarious instinct  the instincts through which religious
conceptions affect social life  the instincts of acquisition and
construction  and there is a final chapter on imitation  play and habit 

mcdougall dividends the instincts into specific tendencies or instincts and
general or non specific tendencies  he calls attention to the abuse of the
term  instincts  and himself defines an instinct as an inherited or innate
psychophysical disposition which has the three aspects of all mental
processes  the cognitive  the affective and the conative  or a knowing of
some object or thing  a feeling in regard to it  and a striving towards or
away from that object    the continued obstruction of instinctive striving
is always accompanied by painful feeling  its successful progress towards
its end by pleasurable feeling  and the achievement of its end by a
pleasurable sense of satisfaction   he reminds us that  the emotional
excitement  with the accompanying nervous activities of the central part of
the disposition  is the only part of the total instinctive process that
retains its specific character and remains common to all individuals and all
situations in which the instinct is excited   we may experience the
emotional excitement and the impulse to the appropriate movements of an
instinct or the re excitement of an instinctive reaction in its affective
and conative aspects without the reproduction of the original idea which led
to its excitation  pleasure and pain but serve to guide these impulses or
instincts in their choice of means towards these ends 

one of mcdougall s important conclusions is that  each of the principal
instincts conditions some one kind of emotional excitement whose quality is
specific or peculiar to it  and the emotional excitement of specific quality
that is the affective aspect of the operation of any one of the principal
instincts may be called a primary emotion   this is mcdougall s definition
of emotion 

mcdougall then takes up for discussion and analysis the principal instincts
and the primary emotions of man which include the following  the instinct of
flight and the emotion of fear  the instinct of repulsion and the emotion of
disgust  the instinct of curiosity and the emotion of wonder  the instinct
of pugnacity and the emotion of anger  the instincts of self abasement  or
subjection  and of self assertion  or self display  and the emotions of
subjection and elation  or negative and positive self feeling   the parental
instinct and the tender emotion  and such other instincts of less
well defined emotional tendencies as the instinct of reproduction  with
sexual jealousy and female coyness   the gregarious instinct  the instincts
of acquisition and construction  and the minor instincts of crawling 
walking  rest and sleep  mcdougall denies the existence of such instincts as
those of religion  imitation  sympathy and play 

there then follows a consideration of some general or nonspecific innate
tendencies or pseudo instincts which are not specific instincts with special
accompanying emotions  and this leads to the analysis of sympathy or the
sympathetic induction of emotion  suggestion and suggestibility  imitation 
play  habit  disposition and temperament 

the sentiments are now taken up for analysis and definition  a sentiment 
according to mcdougall  who accepts shand s definition  is an organized
system of emotional tendencies or dispositions centred about the idea of
some object  among the complex emotions not necessarily implying the
existence of sentiments mcdougall includes admiration  awe and reverence 
gratitude  scorn  contempt and loathing  and envy  among the complex
emotions implying the existence of sentiments he considers reproach 
anxiety  jealousy  vengeful emotion  resentment  shame  joy  sorrow and
pity  happiness  surprise  the nature and the constitution of the sentiments
and the complex emotions comes in for very illuminating analysis  the
chapters on the growth of self consciousness and of the self regarding
sentiment  the advance to the higher plane of social conduct  and volition
are to be considered among the best chapters of this very excellent work 
the discussion and analysis is very penetrating and clear  it is well worth
while presenting the following abstract of the chapter on volition   all
impulses  desires and aversions  motives or conations are of one of two
classes   1  from the excitement of some innate disposition or instinct  and
 2  from excitement of dispositions acquired during the life of the
individual by differentiation from the innate dispositions  under the
guidance of pleasure and pain  when in the conflict of two motives the will
is thrown on the side of one of them and we make a volitional decision  we
in some way add to the energy with which the idea of the one desired end
maintains itself in opposition to its rival  the idea of the self  or
self consciousness  is able to play its great role in volition only in
virtue of the self regarding sentiment  the conations  the desires and
aversions  arising within this self regarding sentiment are the motive
forces which  adding themselves to the weaker ideal motive in the case of
moral effort  enable it to win the mastery over some stronger  coarser
desire of our primitive animal nature and to banish from consciousness the
idea of the end of this desire 

volition  therefore  following mcdougall  may be defined as the supporting
or re enforcing of a desire or conation by the cooperation of an impulse
excited within the system of the self regarding sentiment   the sentiment of
self control is the master sentiment for volition and especially for
resolution  it is a special development of the self regarding sentiment  the
source of the additional motive power  which in the moral effort of volition
is thrown upon the side of the weaker  more ideal impulse  is ultimately to
be found in that instinct of self display or self assertion whose affective
aspect is the emotion of positive self feeling  these remarks are given more
or less verbatim 

mcdougall next analyzes strength of character which he differentiates from
disposition and temperament which are innate   in section two  as stated
previously  the author takes up for separate and more minute analysis the
family  the reproductive and the parental  instincts  the instinct of
pugnacity  the gregarious instinct  the instinctive bases of religion  and
the instincts of acquisition and construction   imitation  play and habit
receive separate treatment in the final chapter 

the reviewer can freely recommend this book as one of the best  if not the
best book of this sort that has come into his hands  his personal opinion is
that it is the best   mcdougall presents us with an acceptable and clean cut
classification of the instincts  emotions and sentiments  he accurately
defines these terms  he gives the analysis and constitution of these
instincts  emotions and sentiments  and develops the motive sources of human
conduct   he adopts many original and novel standpoints  he is an
independent thinker   he has here presented us with a book which  because of
its clearness and its frank meeting of the problems  is of the utmost value
to the psychopathologist and the psychiatrist   in fact the contents of just
such a work as this should be the first lesson of every worker in this
field  in this way only can he really begin to understand human conduct 

this work should find its place in the forefront of those books which should
be read and digested by all workers in any of the social sciences 

for the reviewer it has been a genuine pleasure to read and to review this
book and he most heartily recommends it to the reader of these pages  meyer

most psychiatrists state or tacitly assume that dementia praecox is a
disease of a steadily progressive nature  where the first symptom of
dementia is a signal for relentless degradation of the patient s mental
capacity except in the sphere of the more mechanical  intellectual
functions  yet the experience of every institutional physician denies the
universality of this deterioration  and the statistics in any good text book
demonstrate that many cases are  chronic  rather than  deteriorating  
woodman 1  has made a careful study of 144 such chronic cases  and shows
what a surprisingly large proportion of these develop a good adaptation to
the artificial environment of the institution  so far as we know  however 
no one has attempted to formulate any definite features of onset which could
be taken as a guide in determining the gravity of the mental derangement 
in fact bleuler states categorically that  up to the present no correlation
has been discovered between the symptoms of onset and the gravity of the
outcome    kraepelin has split off from dementia praecox a separate
psychosis  paraphrenia systematica  which he timidly defends as a clinical
entity apparently because the course is a long one and the deterioration
less marked than in dementia praecox  but he gives us no concise prognostic
data  in fact one feels on reading his paper that the diagnosis must be made
post hoc   this problem is manifestly of equal importance from the social
and the scientific standpoint  until we can predict the outcome our
treatment must be empiric and palliative  we confess ourselves ignorant of
the disease process if we cannot make a prognosis 

 1  r  c  woodman  n  y  state hospital bulletin  vol  ii  no  2  1909 

it is possible to make certain a priori speculations as to prognostic
criteria based on classification and what that implies  we know that pure
paranoia is not a deteriorating psychosis  that it does not necessarily
preclude the possibility of considerable social usefulness  and that it
grades off almost imperceptibly into dementia praecox   the features
differentiating these two diseases should therefore supply us with data for
determining the prognosis  a case undoubtedly  praecox  which shows markedly
the differential features of paranoia  should have a proportionately better
outlook  in a vague way our common sense uses this standard when it makes us
 feel  that the case will have a long course which shows a relatively well
retained personality in conjunction with praecox symptoms  but  feelings 
are hardly objective criteria   what symptoms may we make use of   we may
say that the praecox patient as opposed to the paranoia has a poverty or
inappropriateness of affect  a scattering of thought and a lack of
systematization in his delusions  the weakness of will on which kraepelin
lays so much stress may be included  though that can probably be derived
from the scattering of thought  what of these symptoms may be analyzed for
our purpose  affect changes and dissociation in the stream of thought are
themselves signs of the deterioration we wish to predict  to make use of
them we should have at hand some theory as to the relation between their
quality and quantity  and that we have not   there remains the content of
the psychosis  a definitely objective material with which to work  this is
naturally a big problem  almost as wide as insanity itself  and one brief
communication cannot pretend to solve it  what we wish to do is merely to
put forward tentatively the claim of one type of delusion formation to
prognostic value 

now if delusions are to be an index to deterioration they must in some way
hold a mirror to the changes in the personality  repeat them or prefigure
them   if we generalize our conception of functional dementia  we can say
that one of its most striking features is a destruction of the faculty of
appropriate reaction  a loss of what one may term the sense of reality   the
patient in direct proportion to the degree of his dementia loses his
capacity to recognize the reality of his environment or his relationship to
it  and builds up more and more a world of his own in which he lives
untroubled by the demands of adaptation  no one who has ever argued with a
paranoic will forget how keen a sense of reality he may retain  how logical
his arguments are  and how reasonable his delusions appear  if only some one
point be granted  with the praecox  however  the opposite impression may be
quite as striking  his delusions are bizarre  inconsistent  kaleidoscopic 
he has no logical explanation and cannot even state them consecutively  and
all gradations from pure paranoia to dementia praecox seem to have
corresponding losses in the sense of reality as embodied in delusions 

may we not hope to find in the content of the psychosis some objective
criterion as to the degree in which the sense of reality is lost  with all
that it implies 

but what takes the place of the sense of reality or what causes it to go 
with what tendency of the psychotic individual is it in conflict  the answer
is a psychological truism  the indulgence in fancies  imagination  of
course  is essential to every human being  no purposeful action can be
instituted without its first being carried out in imagination  phantastic
thinking begins when the subject fails to apply the test of reality to his
mental image and exclude it if it be not adapted to realization   if
environment or internal inhibitions prevent this realization  however  the
craving   lying back of the fancy must be diverted to a more practical
channel  the normal solution  or the fancy must persist in spite of its
impracticability  this latter process is the germ of the psychosis   but not
its development  a certain compromise may be reached  he who digs for gold
in his back yard is not so crazy as he who reaches out his hand for the
moon  nor is the paranoic who chooses to put his interpretation on the
surliness of his employer as far estranged from reality as the praecox who
recognizes his employer in the person of the physician  the content of the
psychosis may then express the relative strength of the two antagonistic
factors  sense of reality and fancy  the two factors whose relative
importance decide the issue for sanity or insanity 

it is easier to imagine than to act  so no human being is free of this
tendency   but what does the normal man do   he diverts these thoughts into
channels where fancy has a legitimate place  he writes romances  he imagines
himself using an instrument to talk with his friend miles away and invents
the telephone  he imagines a better society than the one which galls him 
and writes a  utopia   above all he theorizes and speculates  according to
his age or ability these speculations give us alchemy or chemistry 
astrology or astronomy  magic or religion  spiritism or psychology  the
were wolf or psycho analysis  phrenology or psychiatry  and so on   now
three generalizations can be made about these primitive or elaborated
philosophizings  first  they all represent a constructive tendency  second 
the degree to which this constructive tendency is exhibited is historically
a measure of the cultural development of any age  an index of the
development of the sense of reality of the time  that is  the particular
speculation is not only accepted as reasonable but has its practical
application for the period  and third  the more primitive forms of these
speculations are represented in the delusions of insane  particularly
dementia praecox  patients   following a suggestion of dr  hoch we have
termed these ideas  constructive delusions   as they correspond to what was
historically a compromise between reality and phantasy  they should
represent a corresponding mildness or severity in the psychosis where they
appear  our observations  far from being extensive  have so far demonstrated
this that we feel justified in offering the hypothesis that when such
delusions are present one can base a mild prognosis on their presence with a
rather specific relationship between the crudity of construction and the
degree of deterioration   it must be borne in mind  however  that we make no
claim as to the invariable presence of such delusions when marked
deterioration does not take place  we hope only to show that when present
this particular form of content may constitute a valuable prognostic guide 
as it represents the degree to which the patient has gone in recapitulating
the history of his civilization 

it should be understood that we are not describing highly unusual cases 
many such have been published   a highly typical one is given by freud in
his analysis of the schreber case  2  in this extremely stimulating paper
freud puts forward the claim that all delusions are an attempt at regaining
health on the part of the psyche  from a broad psychological standpoint 
this is undoubtedly true but the generalization is too wide to be of any
practical psychiatric value   moreover  by choosing for analysis a case
which was neither dementia praecox nor paranoia but a combination of the
two  he reaches conclusions which are valuable additions to our knowledge of
psychotic processes but merely confuse the issue as to the specific
mechanisms of paranoia and dementia praecox  in schreber a profound
psychotic reaction corresponded to crude formulations of his fancies 
whereas  when he built these ideas into constructive speculations  he became
relatively sane and an efficient citizen   if freud had emphasized the point
that this later formulation was more than a vehicle for the cruder thoughts 
that it contained components which were potentially of social value  which
implied a broader contact with the world  had he done this  then the present
paper would be superfluous

the first case we wish to present  john mcm   is at present thirty six years
of age  unmarried  a catholic   for at least nine years he has been
objectively psychotic  though  according to his own account his delusional
habit of thought began seventeen years ago  he had little education but made
the most of it and has read widely  for one of his station  on such topics
as socialism  he was always somewhat distant and did not make friends
easily  from early childhood he was antagonistic towards his father and
brother and  since his mother s death six years ago  to whom he was strongly
attached  towards an aunt as well   he has struck both his father and his
aunt   his antagonism towards his father is of great importance as a
determinant for his later symptoms  when young he feared him  as he grew
older disputed his authority and  according to the father  always disobeyed
him  he was always shy with women and  as we shall see  his first conflict
in the sexual sphere was solved by a psychotic reaction  once an efficient
salesman  for the past nine years he has drifted from one position to
another   as he says himself  he lost ambition after he decided not to get
married  and concluded he would not attempt to gain worldly possessions  but
merely enough to subsist on   his early life showed not so much tendency
towards elation and depression as towards imaginative thinking with a
leaning towards day dreaming and  mysteries   of late years his reading has
been confined to sexual topics  as discussed by various quacks  astrology 
phrenology  christian science  and religion   although he said he discovered
god for himself he never gave up the catholic religion  gradually his energy
has been so engrossed by these interests that he lost position after
position as a result of continually talking of his ideas to his fellow
workers or employers  this tendency eventually led to his commitment  but as
long ago as 1906 a physician said he was insane  for the past six years he
has been cross  stubborn and self willed so that none of family dared to
speak to him  he even left home and took a furnished room by himself  in
spite of this evident anti social tendency he speaks of himself as having
been filled during this period with a great hope  he has been looking into
the future and content that he will reach the goal and sees happiness in the
future   for some months he had talked much of the world coming to an end
and said that those who had money should spend it as it would soon do them
no good  he wanted every one to divide his money with him as  he said 
everything belonged to god   many people were against him and he wrote
letters about this to various officers  it was when he showed some of these
to an assemblyman that he was advised to go to observation pavilion 

when he arrived at manhattan state hospital he was quiet and agreeable 
cooperated readily with his examination and seemed to take his incarceration
as a matter of course  though he has always had mild arguments to prove that
he should be allowed parole  a certain degree of deterioration is evidenced
by his failure to make much of an effort in this direction  although such
effort would be immediately successful   in his manner he was quiet 
occasionally somewhat affected and when talking of his ideas was apt to
assume an expression bordering on ecstasy  at no time did he show an
inappropriate affect or any evidence of scattering or flight   he could talk
quite objectively of his idea  he had had only one halucinatory experience
and even it should  perhaps  be called merely an illusion    on the 14th of
march  1912   he said  i came face to face with god almighty   he spoke in a
jewish dialect and was dressed as a carpenter   the patient was in the
cathedral at the time and that night he had a vision of this man  though
this may have been just a dream  he also heard bishop h  speak of the man
who had come to prepare the world for the second coming of christ   the
bishop looked at this patient which meant that he  the patient  was the man 

before detailing his ideas it may be well to outline their general tendency 
in his psychosis he succeeded in fulfilling the wish of the persian enemy of
reality 

  ah  love  could you and i with him conspire
to grasp this sorry scheme of things entire 
would we not shatter it to bits and then
remould it nearer to the heart s desire  

by the simple expedient of translating his interest from this world to that
of spirits he built up a new heaven and a new earth  where he was supreme
and his chief enemy  his father  was subject to him  beginning with
astrology he found that his father s sign and his showed different
characters  the father s strong in earthly affairs  while the patient s
showed preeminence in spiritual qualities  passing from astrology to the
heavens  he discovered that his father had been jehovah  while he had been
christ   there had been a struggle between them in which the father had been
temporarily successful  but when his father s spirit had entered into a
body  he had become subject to christ   in the heaven to come  jehovah was
to give way to precedence to christ  was to enjoy with the virgin mary  his
mother  a union of love  as much more fervid as it was to be free from
carnal features   in extolling this life of the spirit the patient excluded
that physical problem which had caused him so much trouble   the adult
sexual demand which  in the form of marriage he could not agree to meet nor
yet to put out of his mind   at the same time this religious formulation
gave him a comfortable ascendancy over his hated rival  his father   but it
gives him more than this  he has a mission  he says  he must prepare the way
for the new world  the new heaven   this is an objective interest and it is
that  we think  which has a causal connexion with his mild degree of
deterioration   for he has been what we must regard as a praecox for many
years and yet has lost so little of his personality that to a layman he
would certainly be regarded as little more than a crank  where his system
fails of having a sane outlet it is of course in the fact that his prophecy
has little to do with anything of advantage to others  it is merely a cover
for self glorification 

at nineteen he talked to his friend w  of sexual matters  and  being
troubled with constipation and  rheumatism  at the time  he asked the
physician who was treating him as to whether he should indulge himself
sexually  the physician told him to  but he worried over this advice and
went to a priest  who said for him to get married   this he did not wish to
do  and so turned his attention to astrology and phrenology  the other
subjects which his friend talked of   that this was only a cover for his
original sex problem is shown by his conclusions  that he had a weakness in
amativeness   the faculty of sexual power   his  concentration  on sexual
matters was poor    if i had more amativeness there would be trouble  i am
glad i haven t so much  i was always more of a companion to my mother  and
when i wasn t with her i went to the theatre with w   he and his father  he
learned  had strong faculties of destructiveness  the patient  however 
could control his by reasoning  his reasoning was so strong that he could
even control his father and settle disputes between father and mother 
phrenology also taught him his intellectual superiority to his father in
other ways 

from phrenology he learned there was a time to be born  from this he passed
to astrology   his father had arranged that he should be born in the sign of
virgo  which guaranteed his truthfulness and obedience to his father  he
explained this by speaking of adam and eve disobeying god  from whose sexual
intercourse all evils sprang   manifestly  then  it was his father s
arrangement that he should have to abstain from sexual intercourse 

his father was born in the sign gemini  this is a fighting sign  the father
selected this sign himself  by his great fighting power  the sign is not a
spiritual one but a worldly one  and shows avarice in great grasping of
worldly things   he never thought that his father was so great  until three
or four years ago  he wrote a minister  asking him what became of god the
father  he asked another man about religion  and was told how obedient
christ was to his foster father joseph   he thought of how disobedient he
was to his father  and then decided that his father was the god  the father 
and in the kingdom of heaven he was called jehovah    here he identifies
himself with christ   he says about this  i tried to reason myself away from
it many times  but was finally convinced   the father came to this world as
john  jehovah was the patient s father in the other world  in the other
world he had a falling out with the father  and now the father has that
revenge in his soul  he had some kind of a falling out  a fight  his father 
then jehovah  ruled the third heaven  one of the twelve  which he says is
about the earth  the earth making the thirteenth  this formulation he
derived from astrology   the first heaven aries  the second taurus  and the
third gemini  etc 

his father was born in the sign of gemini  whose symbol is the twins  which
means a duel  and people born in this sign have a dual nature  the father
had a dual nature  and when the father ruled in the third heaven as jehovah 
a duel took place between the patient and the father  and the son s spirit
was separated from a body and roamed about  after a time the patient s
spirit got back into the kingdom by worrying the father  but he was never
admitted in the form of a body  the father and son while still in a body
could both create man and woman  the patient then knew all about creation 
and was endowed with all the powers the father possessed  and helped the
father to build up that kingdom  but when the patient s spirit was separated
from the body his powers became less  so that he could not create a human
being  his physical personality was weakened by this  but the spirit of love
was increased  the father had carried revenge in his soul since then  the
patient was never a ruler of a heaven  but  i was my father s son  i was
next to him  the sons never become rulers unless they win out   the
patient s spirit remained out of his body until he was born into this world 
the patient s father came to this world as john  and married mary mce   when
the father came on earth he placed himself under the jurisdiction of christ
this came about automatically when the father was born 

in the next heaven the patient will be on the same plane as christ  but
perhaps in a lesser degree   there can be only one father  and he will be
under christ s jurisdiction   christ will be supreme  he is part of the
trinity  there is one god as three united persons  they agree on everything 
father  son  and holy ghost   these will be possessed of equal powers  but
one will be looked upon as the father  and another son  and another the holy
ghost   in the new heaven he will have equal rights and powers with the
father 

after the father married two children were born  brothers  the younger being
the patient   he says about this that he was born in the usual way   the
spirit entered the womb of the mother from outside  and from the seed of the
father  and i was born by the will of the father   christ was born of mary
through the will of jehovah  simply the spirit entered the womb and the word
was made flesh  when the father lived as jehovah he created adam and eve   i
was simply my father s son and son of jehovah  perhaps my name was john 
which had some great meaning   jehovah was the greatest spirit in the
universe  but is not now  for when he was born he placed himself under the
jurisdiction of christ  his name is now john  the patient s father  christ
was selected to be the son of jehovah  he was selected by jehovah because
jehovah had a great personality  his father arranged all of this  and he
even selected the sign that the patient was to be born in  when asked who he
is  he said   i am who i am  when i was positive that i am who i claim to
be  

when the patient s spirit was thrown out of the body  it caused adam and eve
to be created  eve was a great spirit in the third heaven  the father
thought that if he could create two persons  and they were congenial to each
other  that adam s soul would be increased or developed by being in company
with eve   when adam and eve were created they were not to have sexual
intercourse  they were merely to come in contact by spoken words  love could
exist without intercourse  it started all the trouble   to adam and eve two
sons were born  and the brotherly love that existed turned to fire and
hatred  they probably became jealous of each other  and so one deceived the
other   at one time he said that perhaps the mother made more over one than
she did the other  again  perhaps father and mother might have favored one
more than the other  hence jealousy arose  his brother was born in the sign
of capricorn  which ordinarily is a sign which is congenial to virgo  his
brother  however  is a crank and not congenial  the brother is jealous of
the patient  because the mother favored the patient 

he did not take his mother s death to heart  as he had expected for two
years that she would die   his aunt said that he told her it was a good
thing the mother was dead  he says that in the other heaven  jehovah s wife
was martha  a sister of the virgin mary   in this life she was mary  the
father may have had many wives in the third heaven  perhaps his mother s
sisters were his wives  as they seem attracted to him   his mother s soul
existed before birth  lived in jerusalem in the time of christ  and was
mary s sister  his mother was born in the eighth sign and could be trusted
with great secrets  his mother kept things to herself  she was both feminine
and masculine  that is  she was strong and sociable   in the sign in which
he was born they have great spiritual conception  keen  searching and
penetrating vision  the symbol is the virgin  and pride makes them more
feminine than masculine  and they are sensitive  he at one time was more
feminine than now  which was due to his sensitiveness  the sign of virgo is
the mid heaven  where love is more intent  there they understand each other 
and there is no disagreement   the magnet of the male and the magnet of the
female are attracted  and they agree with each other in words spoken  this
is true love  like that which existed between christ and the virgin mother 
the virgin mother was born in that sign  there s where she got her name  

when he dies the soul of his mother will enter heaven 

in heaven christ is to raise his mother s soul from purgatory  and she will
become the virgin mary   a spirit rapping in the house  which began shortly
after his mother s death  is her spirit and his guardian angel 

jehovah was jealous of christ as a greater spirit  so had him crucified 
joseph was also jealous of christ because mary loved him more 

further ramifications of his ideas are the cruder conceptions that semen is
the equivalent of thought  and that thoughts of women cause him to have
nocturnal emissions   semen comes from food  to the sacrament he gives a
definitely sexual significance  and it was following communion that he
realized that he was christ 

at one time he thought he could live  and that he could marry a girl and not
have sexual intercourse  because if he got married and had sexual love
trouble would arise   he was convinced by what he saw of his friends and
every one else he knew  his aunt  his mother and father  that they did not
get along well  the divine power knowing that this could not be in this
world  broke the affections he had for this girl  and he concluded he would
never get married   from a worldly point of view he knew that he was a
failure  he had failed in all his business  but he did not care for worldly
things   when he reached this point he knew that he had a mission to
perform  and began to write and preach religion to people who were qualified
to understand  he wrote many letters  all dealing with religion  saying that
he had to get things ready for the second coming of christ  that he was the
successor of christ  and that he was to get things in readiness for the
union of religion  when there should be one shepherd and one fold 

case 2   the next case differs from the first in that the emphasis in the
ideas was laid more on spiritistic and astrological than on religious lines 
another difference in the problems solved by the psychosis is that the
personality of the patient was not incompatible with an outlet to the adult
sexual demand through the channel of prostitution but a basic similarity
lies in the fact that the delusions center around attachment to her father 
again a family situation   the patient is an unmarried woman now forty seven
years of age  of whose early life we know nothing  she had applied for aid
to a charity organization who  becoming suspicious on the report of a police
captain that the woman was a street walker  sent her to the cornell
psychopathological clinic for mental examination  she had some petty
complaints of not being fed properly where she lived  of things not being
clean there and of the women around her being queer  then she launched
spontaneously into her delusional story  needing very few questions to
stimulate a fairly complete recital   throughout an her talk she showed no
abnormalities in her train of thought   she talked in a quiet way of her
 knowledge  but with enthusiasm  smiling frequently but more in a satisfied
or sociable way than with any silly expression  there was not a trace of
ecstasy in her expression   it would have been hard to say definitely that
she had any inappropriate affect  at a later interview  however  she
admitted recent acts of prostitution with no embarrassment whatever 

her psychotic experiences began some ten years ago when she entered into
illicit relations with an elderly married man r   in the south   a year
before she had met a  mastermind  who told her that she would never be seen
in the right light  everything came as he predicted   her lover soon lost
his sexual capacity and so began to show his power by keeping her under his
control but still at arm s length   but she has fooled him for now she has
his power   this power was in the form of  influences   when they worked on
her she would have a throbbing like a typewriter in her head  and would then
be forced to some act  such acts included affairs with various men and
through r  s influences she also lost many positions   for some time she
tried to get him to support her  as it was his  influences  that had ruined
her  but he merely called her a blackmailer and had her put out of his
office   soon  however  as the result of visions she learned that her father
 who is dead  had become christ in the other world  it was all his influence
that had been acting on her through the medium of r  from astrology she
learned that she had been born under two planets  jupiter  influence  and
neptune  spiritual   her father s sign was neptune and he was therefore a
spiritual man  shortly after his death  she had a vision of him floating up
towards the moon and then she knew that he was joining her ethereally  she
had visions of this father christ 

when we turn to the constructive side of these delusions we find that she
regards all her experiences as having been designed by the father christ to
give her training  training that would increase her psychic powers   for
instance  she said part of her training had been frequent accusations of
dishonor with men she never knew  she had to acquit herself of these
charges  thus she gained power  then she found that she did not even need to
expostulate  she could defy them  defy the whole world   as soon as she knew
she was not guilty she felt power   things she was guilty of  she knew were
right for her  because she gained power by these experiences  this was
because through them she learned spiritistic facts and knowledge is power 
according to her system one mind acts over another by greater penetrating
power  though the recipient must be powerful too  sometimes she found that
she had to be reduced by lack of food or other privation to receive
influence   naturally  too  she could communicate with the dead and had many
examples of this power to offer  she had learned  also  about the influence
of the planets over the human brain and how to learn of conditions which
exist for any person  what he should avoid and what to accept   as the
patient was only seen for little over an hour the details of her system of
ideas could not be obtained but she assured the examiner that she never
could tell all she knows about the spirit world   in general  however  she
said that all her knowledge was useful to her and she could give it to
others individually without effort to herself but that she had no way of
giving it directly to the world   if she had a rest and got well connected
socially perhaps she might be able to do it  people who had met her casually
told her that she had done them good  but she could never tell them about
having seen christ  they don t understand   the egoism of her faith is shown
by her statement that  having met christ in practical life  she had no more
use for any church or ritual   her great hope was for the future  when she
passed away  she was to develop her powers more and when reincarnated was to
come back with the big minds of the world  once she had a vision of herself
in some high trees and the  master mind  told her what it meant   in the
future she would have a great mind  she has it now  but the circumstances of
her life are such that it is not recognized 

the essential feature of this case  for our purpose  is that we have in this
woman a paranoid psychosis of a definitely dementia praecox type which after
ten years has shown only suggestive signs of deterioration in her lack of
purpose in work  and her dulling in emotional response  this failure to
deteriorate seems to stand in definite relationship to her system of ideas 
that these have a constructive tendency is shown by the translation of her
cruder thoughts into the setting of the occult with the suggestion of
propaganda and in their pragmatic value  with her  new religion  she has
provided herself with an argument in favor of a life of desultory
prostitution and general vagabondage  she was advised to go to a hospital
but refused  though she will certainly be committed soon  as it is
inevitable that she will run counter to society in some way 

such cases as these first two are familiar to you all and these have been
chosen for this paper practically at random  any large hospital will provide
dozens of similar history whose clinical pictures would serve as well as
what we have given  the next two cases represent two special types of
psychoses  one a chronic manic and the other a definite praecox with
recurrent attacks   any institutional physician is familiar with the
chronically elated patient  who has become a hospital character   a good
worker often who seems to be sufficiently repaid for his toil by the
privilege of stopping the passerby to expound his ideas  such a case is
usually diagnosed as a chronic manic or a dementia praecox  according to the
taste of the examiner 

numerous works have demonstrated how the symbolism of the modern fraternal
organization has grown out of alchemy  mysticism and rosicrucianism  some
centuries ago these symbols were charged with a literal meaning  if a man 
however  in the 20th century attaches a similar significance to these
symbols he is rightly adjudged insane  for instance  no one in a modern
civilization can retain his mental balance and believe in a literal 
physical rebirth  the patient whose case we shall now briefly recite had
done this  he was observed at only one set interview because it was found
that a few questions  apparently innocent  led to the awakening of some
cruder ideas to which he reacted rather strongly with the statement that the
physician was accusing him of harboring murderous designs which were  as a
matter of fact  not even remotely suggested  the patient c  g   is a hebrew 
married  age sixty one  when forty he had an attack of excitement lasting a
few weeks   he was admitted to the manhattan state hospital in october 1899
and remained till april 14  1900 with a similar attack   he was readmitted
in april 1901 again in an excitement and has remained there ever since  it
is claimed that these attacks were all preceded by a spree  the records of
these admissions state that he was excited for some years  apparently with
exacerbations  during which he is frequently noted as being delusional and
hallucinating  no content is noted so that we cannot give the development of
his ideas  he does not hallucinate now   all we know is that for five or six
years he was a rather intractable patient  who worked intermittently but
that of more recent years he has sufficiently adapted himself to the
hospital environment to be granted ground parole which he uses largely to do
a considerable amount of quite useful work  any one who has once talked to
him is saluted from a distance with the words   pleased to meet you 
doctor     five fingers up   or  da liegt der schwarze hund begraben    all
this is followed by an elated volubility   when asked what  pleased to meet
you   meant  he said that was the password for entrance to the  fellowship
lodge  of a certain fraternal order   he produced a match box with the
insignia on it of a grade in the lodge   with this match box  once off
ward s island  he insisted that it could get him his bread all the world
over and hundreds of friends   he would never have been committed had he not
been drunk and forgotten to make use of his signs  the world belongs to the
fellowship of men   he spoke of his wife s ill treatment of him and then
went on to  i am married to the american flag and it will go to the grave
with me   this referred  he explained  to joining the red  white and blue
lodge   five fingers up   was shaking hands  the clasped hands on his match
box  these hands  he said  were those of moses and the lord  for moses was a
 fellowman   which is like the fellowship of the father  son  and holy
ghost   however  he went on to say that moses  the trinity and god were all
a dream  israel and the high grade are real  the high grade is the lord   g 
stands for god and he belongs to the g lodge  therefore he belongs to god s
lodge   but he has a uniform of the high grade at home  so he must be the
high grade himself  by using the symbols of his order in this way he
disposes of his wife who has not treated him well  identifies himself with
god  while he abolishes the regular god  and endows himself with the
supremest power in a lodge which he regards as omnipotent in the world 
another group of his ideas refer to his race   he has been put on ward s
island as a result of the great struggle between christians and israel   but
israelites are the head of the fellowship lodge  so all christians must
follow him  the patient 

this is the explanation of  da liegt der schwarze hund begraben   he is like
a dog in the house and he is considered to be nobody  a corpse on the floor 
but he really lies here buried  the missing man of the tribe   once off
ward s island  therefore  he will come to life as head of israel  and head
of the omnipotent lodge   patiently  hopefully  he awaits rebirth   the
egoism of these ideas is obvious  wherein do the constructive factors lie 
simply in this  this expansiveness could easily be formulated directly  but
he does not do so   his ideas include two objective and potentially
altruistic interests his lodge and his race  he is interested in them  in
fact one can probably say that it is just in so far as he is insane that the
selfish determination for these interests become manifest 

we have also studied two cases of recurring excitements in patients one of
whom was an evident praecox  the other of doubtful classification  both
showed queer behavior during their intervals with mild indications of their
ideas which gained freer expression in their attacks  these episodes showed 
of course  markedly a typical feature in a tremendous amount of queer
behavior and more excitement than true elation  as there was nothing in
their ideas essentially different in principle from the cases already
quoted  they need not be further detailed 

the last case  r  e  o m   is one of no less interest from a formal
standpoint than from a psychological one  while the trend presented is so
copious that it can well serve as a resume of the cases we have just
recited  he is now an unmarried man of thirty three  and although he was
diagnosed dementia praecox ten years ago is now earning  1200 year as a
stenographer in the government service  his father was an irishman banished
from great britain because of his political agitations   his mother was a
french woman of huguenot extraction who died of cancer before the patient
reached his teens but to whom he was greatly attached  he has a sister two
years older than himself  given to hysteric attacks  for whom his love is
 platonic   to use his own term  although of more than normal intellectual
vigor  judging by his success in school work  he probably always had a
psychotic tendency  at seven or eight he saw a vision of god in the clouds 
at puberty he masturbated considerably and used to stand before the mirror
and  hypnotize  himself   in the fall of 1903  then twenty one  he was
staying at a summer hotel where he met a girl who made love to him  when he
began to have frequent emissions  being caught together out in a storm  in
an effort to protect her his hand found its way to her hair   he was greatly
upset  on returning to the hotel he endeavored to avoid her  and  his father
being slightly ill  he became convinced he was going to die  a month or so
later he moved from baltimore  which had been his home  and began employment
with the government in washington   he had more emissions and immediately
developed hysterical heart trouble  and from his retrospective account also
had ideas of people influencing him  a year later  june 1905  a frank
psychosis with considerable manic flavor developed   secretary of state hay
had died  and peace negotiations between russia and japan were in progress 
he got the idea that he was to succeed hay  whose face he saw in the clouds 
and that he would make peace between the nations  the accompanying
excitement was so intense that when he came to see his father in baltimore
the latter had him committed to the sheppard and enoch pratt hospital  3  he
remained there for one year and eight months  during which time his mood
showed great variability   at times he would be elated  again depressed or
anxious  often silly with irrelevant laughter  towards the end of his
admission he had quite long intervals when he appeared normal   eight months
after his discharge he began to have monthly attacks lasting from one to two
weeks  at the beginning of 1911 he came under the observation of one of us
at the johns hopkins hospital dispensary   his case was followed minutely
for some months when the following extraordinary clinical picture was seen
to develop with regular periodicity  his interest would gradually withdraw
from his work and an abstracted   dim  look come into his eyes   he ceased
to sleep either day or night   ideas  in the intervals latent  would become
more insistent  and he talked of them in a distracted way with occasional
silly laughter and some scattering  at the same time he would show
considerable physical unrest  rocking in his chair  nodding his head 
sucking with his lips  and making occasional grimaces   a sharp word would 
however  bring him to reality and normal behavior and speech  or the same
result could be obtained by his own volition  in fact sufficient effort from
either without or within could  it was several times demonstrated  postpone
the further development of these symptoms for several days  inevitably 
however  control over his psychosis was lost  he became more excited  was
assaultive till chastised by his father  after which that symptom no longer
appeared  he would give none but irrelevant answers to questions  he
masturbated openly  in the next phase he refused to answer questions
altogether  sat in a chair by the window  rocking and tapping the floor or
wall with his feet  reading a paper in a whisper or tearing it into scraps 
spitting on the floor  his clothes or the window pane and then drawing
pictures with his finger on the wet glass  intermittently chanting the same
air over and over again with words  totally indistinguishable  except for
the name  jesus christ  apparently interpolated irregularly in the course of
the song  all this time he wore a silly smile occasionally breaking into a
low chuckling laugh devoid of real emotion  in a short time his clothes and
his immediate surroundings were in a state of horrid filth from his saliva
and the torn papers  towards the end of the attack he ceased making any
sounds  simply rocked  spat and grinned   he would often pass twenty four
hours without emptying his bladder  though he never wet nor soiled himself 
few psychiatrists would have required more than a casual examination to give
a diagnosis of hopeless deterioration  if they saw the patient only in the
latter stage of one of these attacks  yet in from seven to fourteen days
after the first onset he would go to bed  sleep well  and in the morning
appear perfectly normal and resume his efficient work   and this story had
been repeated regularly once a month for four years  when normal his memory
was hazy for the external events occurring during his attack  corresponding
with his objective lack of contact with his environment  but the
recollections of his ideas showed that he had been living in a perfect riot
of fancies  the inference from this is inevitable that what we regard as a
 trendless praecox  or a taciturn dement may simply be one who does not
choose to talk and not necessarily a vegetative wreck with neither delusions
nor hallucinations 

 3  for the privilege of using observations made on this patient at the
sheppard and enoch pratt hospital  we wish most heartily to thank the
superintendent  dr  edward n  brush 

his ideas were found to be no less interesting than his formal picture   in
fact  if the theory we are now advancing be correct and we had had it then 
we believe it would have been possible to state at the time of his first
attack that his psychosis would not show rapid deterioration  we might even
have gone further and predicted that he would reach some such stage of
relative sanity as he now enjoys   he has presented three types of ideas 
the first is crude expressions of bald sexual fancies  the second is
transitional in that  as many praecox patients do  he gave these ideas a
religious or philosophical setting  but in the hallucinations and delusions
embodying them  still retained his personal connection with the fancies  for
instance  he identified himself with christ  or he suffered from
psychological influences exerted by others on him   these two types occurred
only during attacks  the third type represented the real constructive
tendency  during his  normal  intervals when he objectivized these ideas in
the form of speculations as to the origin of life  the laws of society 
religion  etc   the second type  the transitional  represented reciprocally
two tendencies  in the psychosis it showed his constructive  healing
capacity  while the development of such fancies  as allied himself directly
with his speculations when  normal   was invariably the signal for another
attack  the severity of which was in direct proportion to the crudity which
his formulations reached  the complexity and number of his theories when
going about his work was tremendous  which could be partially accounted for
by his omnivorous reading   he read all sorts of historical  occult 
scientific and philosophical works  the material of which he absorbed only
in so far as he could weave it into the fabric of his depraved speculations 
this colored his transitional ideas as well  for in each attack he would
have a new dramatization of his fancies determined by what he had just been
reading   to present these ideas with anything like completeness would take
hours  we must be content  therefore  with a few fragmentary examples 

the more important of his crude ideas were   his trouble was caused by loss
of semen  his attacks were always ushered in by emissions   to prevent which
he sometimes put rubber bands around his penis  numerous homosexual fancies 
he was a woman  he had a vagina  there was a maiden head in his forehead
which was operated on to cause him to lose semen  different people made
immoral proposals or had designs on his virginity  these people he all
identified directly or indirectly with his father  finally there was an idea
that his mother s marriage with his father was not right  that he was not
his father s son  and that his father was inimical to him   he talked of
killing different persons whom at other times he identified plainly with his
father  during an attack he assaulted his father  not infrequently he would
take his father s picture from the wall and spit on it  the relations
between his father and mother were adulterous  he claimed 

if we now take the crude homosexual fancies and study their first
elaboration we find that he had many ideas about eunuchs  they worked on him
by psychological influence   the eunuchs  who could control sun and moon 
influenced him through them  once he had a vision of the sun approaching him
with which he was physically connected  the vision would disappear if he
lost his virginity  these influences when referred to himself were agencies
causing loss of semen  so that he would become a eunuch himself   at the
time of his heart attack and later he thought there was a snake around his
heart  this was a man who had turned himself into a snake in order to
incorporate himself into the patient s body   his religious fancies
apparently began with his delusion that he was christ and in connection with
this we find he had the theory that christ was a virgin  one setting of his
 psychological influence  experience  when he was in bed in one room and
eunuchs were influencing from the next   he duplicated by saying he was
jesus christ in one room and god was in the next  he explained after one of
his attacks that his attention was fixed on the windowpane on which he spat
because there was a flower there  during an attack he was heard to say
something about the struggle of men against being raped by ions and flowers 
in these primitive elaborations we find an effort at distortion  a getting
away from the absolutely crude and that the added elements which cause this
distortion are in the form of ideas which imply a certain degree of
philosophizing  the truly constructive delusions appear when he has ceased
to dramatize these theories with himself as the hero and treats them
objectively  we then find that eunuchs are very important people in his
philosophy  the medium of their power we shall see shortly   all women are
eunuchs because they have no testicles   there is no difference between men
and women  if a woman is stronger than her husband  he takes on her
qualities  in india men suckle the children   he says that this is a
well known fact  a person could change himself into a cancer and so get into
another s body  this is perhaps an echo of something he had read of
ribbert s theory of neoplasms   another pseudoscientific theory concerns a
method of reproduction which could be developed  he thought   if a
beautiful  strong man reaches his normal growth  all life above that is
moulded by his ideals   he can develop within himself another personality
which may be divorced from his body   immaculate conception takes place this
way  an argument he had in favor of this view was prenatal influence and the
strong influence a woman s belief is supposed to have on pregnancy  eunuchs
control the sun and moon   the jews have a secret process of eunuchry  they
have a way of inserting an instrument  a drawing of which he made  showing
distinctly phallic features  by psychological means into the glands or
bodies of men  thus cleaning them out  the eunuchs of the romans used to
cure their fellow countrymen of snakes growing around the heart by
ingratiating themselves into persons  thus displacing the snakes and killing
them   the government has many eunuchs in their employ   the influences of
these men are malign or beneficial  they can injure enemies of the
government or the government can incorporate them into bodies of other men
to save the latter  all cardinals  most diplomats and many missionaries are
eunuchs  the psychological influence exerted by such individuals may cause a
loss of blood to their victims or they may use this power beneficially  the
romans  for instance  put blood of crucified people into the hands of
eunuchs  who impregnated it by psychological influence into others  this
would save their lives and eventually save the nation 

the ideas we have mentioned showing rivalry with his father  apparently in
relation to his mother  were largely elaborated in political and religious
disguises in their transition states  which in turn led to an objective
interest in politics and religions  he spoke of killing the president which
may be taken as a disguise for killing his father since he often claimed
that his father was this or that ruler   he also spoke of killing one of his
employers  he was prone to speak of his father as edward vii   his envy of
this situation of authority was shown when he once told the physician that
his face was suspended in the face of the physician who was a king of
england   but not the real king  he added  edward vii was the real king 
again he said that he was robert emmet and the physician was lord norbury 
the judge who convicted robert emmet  after whom the patient was named   in
that role the physician told him it was all up  that there was no more irish
race   it must be remembered that his father was a fenian   a fruitful
source of speculations about international politics was found in the
transitional ideas he expressed about the extraction of his parents 
beginning with his cogitations about the friction which actually existed
between his parents  he ascribed this to their differing nationalities and
religions   this led in turn to his fancying that on both sides his blood
was drawn from many sources  he was particularly fond  for instance  of
identifying his father with hebrews  or chinese  his mother with romans 
italians or spaniards   his original interest in the union  or disharmony 
of his parents was easily transferred to this international setting and most
of his attacks were heralded by dramatizations of political ar international
situations with which he was intimately connected  this was true of his
first attack when he had an idea that he was to succeed secretary hay and
make peace between russia and japan  his mother and father   on recovery
these fancies were objectivized into a most intense interest in diplomacy 
he knew the history and achievement of every diplomatist in europe  though
of course his data were always being distorted to fit with his insane
theories   intermarriage  for example  was the cause of political trouble 
he developed the ideas as follows  when an irishman marries one of another
race a confusion of races results  this was what took place in the tower of
babel  this is what causes disunion between states   he elaborated  too  on
popular associations of certain customs with certain peoples  gypsies  it is
popularly supposed  frequently abduct children  with the patient this became
an elaborate theory about an egyptian custom or egyptian influence   the
egyptians  he said abducted children and brought them up as their own
acquiring a sinister influence over them because of the belief the children
had that these adults who were their guardians were their real parents  in
one attack he spoke of his father as  an egyptian influence   this is
plainly the same idea as he put into another form when he remarked that he
would be all right if he could become english   when in his free intervals 
he made it a practice sedulously to cultivate english people 

this undercurrent of rivalry with the father came out in a religious
disguise as well   his first attack when he was for many months interned he
described as a religious mania  by means of identifying himself with christ
he dramatized both his subjugation and defiance   he went through many
crucifixion experiences  said he was commanded by god   on the other hand he
said christ was a virgin and retained his virginity in order that he might
discover the secrets of the elders  for this reason he was crucified   the
crudest expression he gave of defiance in a religious form was when he said
 i was two persons in one  god and jesus christ   god was damned   the more
constructive tendency was shown by his fasting  this was due to an
experience of some duration when he was translated back to the first
century  was in a convent  sic   and was tempted by the devil to eat   his
fasting  he claimed  saved the other patients   his most constructive
delusion was that all the churches would come together and then there would
be only one church   during his first attack this was his  prophecy   during
his saner intervals there were endless ramifications of this idea which are
too tedious to recite  it is important to note as evidence of the purely
psychotic character of his ideas that he has never been either religious in
his spirit or in action a propagandist 

perhaps the most luxurious fancies this patient evolved were around the
theme of semen   we have seen that his emissions were his constant worry  an
increase in their frequency heralded an attack and he was convinced that if
he could but retain this secretion he would be permanently cured  nay more 
if he could retain enough he would grow to be like the giants of old 
whenever he had an emission he felt on waking a pain in his head and could
never get totally rid of the idea that this was cancer  in his attacks the
cancer was the result of a homosexual assault and in his intervals he
elaborated theories as to the origin of cancer  it came from friction 
therefore coitus could produce it  it might be the result of adultery or
cancer of the breast could come from a man rubbing his penis on the breasts
of a woman  the cancer germs might come from semen if one believed in cancer
and in germs   life both as vital force and in the biological sense he
identified with semen  psychic activities too had the same origin which he
explained thus  food taken into the mouth goes into the stomach and becomes
chyle  chyle passes to the scrotum  thence to the spine and brain  brain
power is in direct proportion to the amount of semen retained  we see now
why eunuchs had such power according to his philosophy  by childish
reasoning  since they could not have emissions  their semen must be
retained   he spoke of psychological influence in these terms    it is the
transformation from the moisture state of the life principle to the moist
electric state of warmth and its transference from the central ducts and
glands to the head and being thrown out of the head in waves from the top of
the head and eyes   it redounds to the other person s good  have an eunuch
near you  it tends to make semen go to the head and gives the mental mouth
something to think of  it could be used in a baleful way if one had will
power over another person like hypnotism   svengali and trilby   in
hypnotism the will goes on the same lines as psychological influence   the
jews  he said  lay around temples so much that their life had to go into
sensuality or wisdom and it mostly went into wisdom  continual seminal
losses  he claimed  would lead to a change in personality    life   he said 
permeated nature  it could not be lost   wind was thus identified with it 
 life  goes on a sheet  from an emission   the sheet is washed and the
 life  passes to the water  then is taken up by the air and breathed  thus
he suffered both immediate and remote effects from emissions  the first
result was to make him incapable of work  by breathing in the  life  later
on he became a degenerate  wind or the spiral movements of air was another
origin of life  wind is a spirit  in defence of which he quoted the greek
pneuma  the words wind and word are the same  the former being derived from
the latter through wird    cf   in the beginning was the word   or  the word
was made flesh    a cyclone is an effort hampered by civilization of what
the world was originally  life began as a spiral movement of air   wind as
the origin of life could be duplicated by mechanical methods or eunuchry 
the sun he claimed was an accident   men lived for centuries without it 
till an accident  internally  led to vital forces being emanated and that
was the origin of sun  the accident was the cutting of some man s testicles 

now what was his further course   we have seen that in his attacks he
expressed resentment against his father s domination  at the beginning of
one of them  for instance  which he said was brought on by  egyptian
influence   he had a dream of an old hebrew play of father and son   in this
play they were trying to make him return to the old situation of bondage to
his father  this bondage was an actuality   owing to his monthly attacks he
could hold no regular position and so worked for his father  the latter gave
him no money except occasional small silver but bought for him clothes or
anything else he might need  a psychotic man of nearly thirty  with a
feminine character  he was hopelessly dependent on his father   it is small
wonder that he sought relief in recurring psychotic episodes   but a change
came  on may 12  1911  his father died suddenly of heart trouble  the
patient was beginning to go into an attack at the time but pulled himself
together  managed the funeral three days later  got his sister home  who had
a hysterical attack at the grave  and then proceeded to indulge in his
postponed attack  the sister was unable to care for him so he was sent again
to the sheppard and enoch pratt hospital   in a few days he recovered  he
was then talked to  told that this baleful relationship was over and that
there was no longer any reason for his having attacks  with the exception of
one attack at the beginning of 1912 he has had none  and seems to be able to
maintain the mental equilibrium that previously characterized his intervals 
for two and a half years he has been employed in the customs house 
baltimore  a position which he secured by competitive examination  and has
received an advance in salary from  900 to  1200 a year  he was recently
written to and replied in exceptional literary form detailing more of his
ideas   they seem to be essentially similar to those held four years ago 
one may be quoted   a favorite  scientific  method with him has always been
 from boyhood  he said  to divide up or distort words so as to get at their
true meaning  this is now his explanation of the word  cancer  

 you may remember the origin of the word  cancer  was once the topic of our
meeting and strangely this matter has kept revolving itself in my mind ever
since   my new solution is  kahns  and  ur   you know there are a good many
people named  kahn  and as probably you have noted in the bible allusion to
the ancient race of the name  ur   now  you can place what construction you
will on the combination   there are several  here is one  i have heard it
stated that the word  ur  originally meant  wife  hence  from our point of
view the solution is easy  kahn s ur or kahn s wife  but what has puzzled me
is what she is doing in so many people 

 here s another   signifying the overcoming of the jew by ur or kahn by ur
 kahn by  er  much on the same principle as the words  spanish american  and
 graeco roman  are used with reference to the late  unpleasantness  and the
ancient one 

 here s another   simply meaning that kahn is not a jew at all but simply an
ur 

 so you see i have not altogether forgotten some of the topics of our
meeting  

if our claims be allowed we should be able to make some deductions of value
to psychiatric theory   the first is an explanation of scattering of
thought   we find that  in all our cases showing constructive delusions  the
utterance of these highly elaborated fancies is not accompanied by
scattering   on the other hand it is an every day experience that a dementia
praecox patient may show no scattering when conversing on indifferent
subjects but that his train of thought loses logical sequence when he
launches into his ideas  these findings may be reconciled by studying the
reaction with types of ideas such as the last patient showed   in his
intervals he was  and is  continually busy with delusional thoughts but of a
constructive character  but was never scattered as long as these were alone
present  as soon  however  as an attack commenced and cruder ideas appeared
he became scattered   where were these crude ideas in the intervals  they
were represented in his constructive delusions it is true  but in their
native form they did not appear   the cruder fancies must therefore have
been in the unconscious during his intervals  now actual verbatim records
show with him that these crude ideas did not come to expression in logical
sequence but that each appeared in response to an idea previously in his
consciousness which was a distorted formulation of the crude fancy next to
appear  his utterances during these attacks would have a logical sequence if
they were translated into terms of the underlying crude ideas  the
scattering  therefore  was due to the fact that his utterances were a
mixture of crude and elaborated fancies   had they been entirely one or the
other there would have been no scattering  during his intervals he dealt
with objective fancies and was logical  as these fancies  however  could be
easily demonstrated to be derived from the unconscious crude ones  which
appeared during his attacks  we are safe in assuming that one factor at
least in the production of an attack was the lifting of some inhibition
which kept the cruder ideas from entering consciousness except in a form in
which they could be objectively viewed and so logically arranged  scattering
of thought therefore arises from the intermittent action of this censor or
from an incomplete abolition of the inhibition allowing varying formulations
of the crude ideas to gain expression which have no logic surface
connection   if entirely done away with  of course  the latent ideas
appearing in perfect crudity would have a logical connection   the content
of consciousness is what is within the sphere of introspection   we can
therefore say that the praecox who is scattered really does not know his own
ideas   this is  of course  an every day experience for those who examine
such patients  a suitable case left to himself will give expression to a
limited number of delusions which he does not correlate   a few suggestive
questions  however  will educe a mass of delusions  which when pieced
together demonstrate the logical unconscious ideas that give rise to them 
if such a patient be asked  what are your ideas   he can give no reply  ask
him  however  if any one is mistreating him and you will start a train of
thought in which one fancied insult leads to another or to delusions which
do not represent mistreatment at all   on the other hand approach a patient
with constructive delusions with the same question as to his ideas and he
will produce a theory of the universe  often with a chronological account of
how these ideas developed  he is insane in that his fancies do not reach an
outlet in action being an end in themselves  but he is sane in so far as he
keeps his ideas within the range of introspection and has not allowed them
to become autonomous  the inferences from this to the laws of normal
association are obvious 

the second point is really a historical one  psychiatrists are often asked 
 was joan of arc crazy    was saint louis a dementia praecox    in an
endeavor to answer such questions wise books have been written detailing the
 psychoses  of historic or religious leaders  there is probably not a single
delusion expressed by any one of the patients whose cases have just been
recited that is not duplicated or paralleled by the belief of savants of a
few centuries ago or the uneducated of to day  the last patient said  all
nature is artificial  man made it all  all the world would disappear  if man
lost the power of reproducing  the reproduction of nature by man is founded
on faith  constant reiteration and association with a thing will produce
that thing   is this not analogous to the working hypothesis of the
alchemists  the more sincere among them sought salvation for their souls  to
gain this they worked with metals to which they ascribed abstract or moral
qualities   their metallurgy was primarily symbolic  yet they seriously
hoped for results by working with symbols  and to what extent of absurdity
and crudity did they go  many of their metallurgic terms were sexual
processes  their  prima materia  was called by the name of many of the
secretions or excretions of the body   a whole school  the
seminalists  adhered to the view that the great original substance was
semen   other thought it was hermaphroditic  paraceleus spoke of the birth
of monsters as a result of sodomy  a natural history 4  written three
centuries ago tells of semen being carried by wind   notoriously there was
no limit either to the absurdity or crudity of these conceptions  were these
men  the wisest of their time  insane   here again we may quote the last
patient   insanity   he says   is the elemental human mind left to itself 
unimproved by other minds   the last is the important phrase   what minds
were there to improve those of the alchemists   what critic was there to
tell joan of arc that visions and voices were pathological  that was the
regulation form of inspiration in her day  comparative mythology like a
comparison of mysticism  alchemy  rosicrucianism and masonry shows that the
human mind left to itself will formulate similar ideas   these ideas 
however  are modified by the advance of learning as time goes on  the
individual whose critical faculty allows him to maintain an idea
incompatible with the knowledge of his age and his fellows is insane 

 4  the historie of foure footed beastes  by edward topsell  london  1607 

our last point is a corollary to the claim we have just made  it has been
the sport of iconoclasts for many years to discount all religious beliefs as
psychopathic   this is not the forum where the problem of science versus
religion may be discussed but these cases have certain features which should
warn us to be wary of such generalizations  we have seen that religious
formulations have been used to embody crude fancies   that does not preclude
the possibility of the formulations having an actual basis   a flag may gain
its importance to a given individual because it symbolizes for him his
native land but that does not prove that the flag has not an existence of
itself  this  however  is a matter of logic and not of psychiatry   let us
now grant that all religious formulations have an unconscious origin  but
there still remains a wide gulf between patients such as we have been
describing and the devout church goers  the former show in their productions
how their religious ideas arise  their egocentric quality is patent  they
manifestly are but thin cloaks for selfish wishes  the latter  however 
never in consciousness connect their religious formulations with their
subjective creations   to the true believer his god is as objective a
reality as is the electron of the physicist  finally  real religious faith
has a pragmatic value  granting it be only a theory it nevertheless produces
results in conduct  this is in sharpest contrast to religious delusions 
they never lead to sustained effort  they bring with them no social
potentiality  they exist for the comfort of the patient alone 

to sum up   we have endeavored to establish the claim that delusions in
dementia praecox which takes the form of objective speculations rather than
subjective experiences are an evidence of a milder psychotic reaction and
hence warrant a prognosis of chronicity rather than deterioration  from the
cases presented we argue that scattering of thought arises from a failure to
formulate underlying fancies in an objective way  that the insanity of ideas
depends not on themselves but on the critical judgment of the age which
produces them  and lastly that there are essential psychological differences
between creeds and religious delusions 



socrates in the light of modern psychopathology

by morris j  karpas  m  d 

assistant resident alienist  psychopathic department of bellevue hospital of
new york

 read before the vidonian club  new york  october 16  1914  

 consciousness had reached this point in greece  when in athens  the great
forum of socrates  in whom subjectivity of thought was brought to
consciousness in a more definite and more thorough manner  now appeared 
but socrates did not grow like a mushroom out of the earth  for he extends
in continuity with his time  and this is not only a most important figure in
the history of philosophy  but perhaps also a world famed personage  
hegel 



 when columbus set sail across the untraversed western sea  his purpose was
to reach by a new path  a portion of the old  known world  and he lived and
died in the belief that he had done so   he never knew that he had
discovered a new world  so it was with socrates   when he launched his
spiritual bark upon the pathless ocean of reflected thought  his object was
to discover a new way to the old world of little commonwealths and narrow
interests  and he probably died thinking he had succeeded  he did not dream
that he had discovered a new world  the world of humanity and universal
interests   but so it was  and tho mankind are still very far from having
made themselves at home in that world  and from having availed themselves of
its boundless spiritual treasures  it can never be withdrawn from their
sight  or  the conquest of it cease to be the object of their highest
aspirations    thomas davidson 



introduction

the hellenic influence upon the intellectual development of the world is
infinite   the intellectual force emanating from the sources of greek art 
literature and philosophy permeated thru the ages and have helped to shape
the destiny of our civilization   except the blind forces of nature   says
sir henry sumner maine   nothing moves in this world which is not greek in
its origin    1   without a shadow of doubt  greek philosophy forms the firm
background of progressive and reflective thought in all its phases and
ramifications 

in the history and evolution of hellenic thought  we find two tendencies of
inquiry   one dealing with the objective manifestations of the universe  and
the other directed towards the study of the mind   to the former class
belong thales  anaximander  anaximenes  pythagoras  and others that
attempted to discover some principle for the explanation of the natural
phenomena  to accomplish this end  mathematics  physics  metaphysics  etc  
were resorted to   the other great epoch  which may be termed the
renaissance of greek philosophy  was conceived by the supreme greek thinker 
socrates  who forms the subject thesis of this paper 

socrates was the father of psychology and the grandfather of modern
psychopathology   he was the first one that attempted to study man from the
point of view of subjectivity   in the words of snyder   in socrates  the
human mind burst forth into knowing itself as thinking   2   and zeller very
thoughtfully remarks   the interests of philosophy being thus turned away
from the outer world and directed towards man and his moral nature  and man
only regarding things as true and binding of the truth of which he was
convinced himself by intellectual research  there appears necessarily in
socrates a deeper importance attached to the personality of the
thinker   3   in phaedrus  socrates speaks   i am a lover of knowledge  and
in the cities i can learn from men  but the fields can teach me
nothing   4   although aristophanes pictures socrates in the clouds as
preaching natural philosophy  yet there is no authentic record of this 

the source of information regarding the biography of socrates and his
philosophy comes from two authors  xenophon and plato   the former portrays
him as a moral philosopher and in his book  memorabilia  he seems to
eulogize his master   the latter however presents him as a thinker  and it
is maintained by many critics that plato put into the mouth of socrates his
own ideas   it is lamentable that this great philosopher committed nothing
of his monumental work in writing 



the personality of socrates

it is difficult to construct a biographic sketch of socrates in a
chronological and systematic order   he was born in the year 469 b  c  his
father was sophroniscus  a sculptor  and his mother phaenarete  a midwife 
he followed his father s vocation and it is believed that he showed poor
skill in the profession  we know nothing of his early intellectual and moral
development  since he was bred in athens  he most probably received the
usual education peculiar to that age   he was a soldier and took part in
military campaigns and wars   it is maintained that in military life he
displayed considerable bravery  endurance and fortitude  the exact date of
his appearance in public arena is difficult to ascertain  however   in the
traditions of his followers he is almost uniformly represented as an old  or
as a gray headed man   5  

there are distinctive traits in the personality of socrates that are worthy
of emphasis because of their dynamic import 

he was described as eccentric in his general mode of conduct  he  strutted
proudly barefoot along the streets of athens  he was careless and shabby in
his dress  in his manner he was affected and haughty and was subject to
ecstatic trances and visions  during these trances he would maintain a
standing posture for hours  buried in his thoughts  and was quite oblivious
to the external world  there was a celebrated occasion in the camp at
poteidaice  when socrates was not quite forty  on that occasion he stood
motionless from early morning on one day till sunrise on the next  right
through a night when there was a very hard frost  when the sun rose he said
his prayer and went about his business    6   it is also claimed that he
would give vent to bursts of anger and fiery passion 

ever since early boyhood socrates is supposed to have heard an inner voice 
which he called a divine sign   it came to him quite often both on important
and on insignificant occasions  according to xenophon  this voice gave him
both negative and positive warnings  however  plato holds that this voice
only exercised its influence in opposing the execution of certain things 
 and not only was he generally convinced  says zeller   that he stood and
acted in the service of god  but he also held that supernatural suggestions
were communicated to him  not only through the medium of public oracles  but
also in dreams  and more particularly by a peculiar kind of higher
inspiration which goes by the name of the socratic daimoviov   7  

even by his contemporaries he was regarded as singular and eccentric and his
general behavior was ever foreign to his compatriots  indeed lelut   8  
boldly asserts that socrates was  un fou   nevertheless  attempts were not
wanting to excuse him   so writes zeller   either on the ground of the
universal superstition of his age and nation  or else of his having a
physical tendency to fanaticism   9  

another interesting feature in the life of socrates is that he married late
and that his matrimonial life was far from being happy  and in the words of
schwegler   he nowhere shows much regard for his wife and children  the
notorious  though altogether too much exaggerated ill nature of xantippe 
leads us to suspect  however  that his domestic relations were not the most
happy   10   it is also important to note that there was a turning point in
the history of his life when he took up the preaching of philosophy  it must
be borne in mind that he took no money for his teaching and at the same time
he left his wife and children destitute  in regard to this draper remarks 
 there is surely something wrong in a man s life when the mother of his
children is protesting against his conduct  and her complaints are
countenanced by the community   11  

it is also significant that socrates displayed a certain degree of
masochism  our historians tell us that socrates would deny himself bodily
comforts and insist on enduring hardship   xenophon in memorabilia says 
 but they knew that socrates lived with the utmost contentment on very small
means  that he was most abstinent from every kind of pleasure  and that he
swayed those with whom he conversed just as he pleased by his
arguments   12   again   is it not the duty of every man to consider that
temperance is the foundation of every virtue  and to establish the
observance of it in his mind before all things  for who  without it  can
either learn anything good or sufficiently practice it   who  that is a
slave to pleasure is not in an ill condition both as to his body and his
mind   it appears to me  by juno  that a free man ought to pray that he may
never meet with a slave of such a character  and that he who is a slave to
pleasure should pray to the gods that he may find well disposed masters  for
by such means only can a man of that sort be saved   13   and   he appeared
also to me  by such discourses as the following  to exhort his hearers to
practice temperance in their desires for food  drink  sensual gratification 
and sleep  and endurance of cold  heat and labor   14  

although he condemned poederastia  yet he was always fond of the male sex 
particularly of the young   this  however  may be explained on the ground
that his object was to appeal to the young  nevertheless  dynamic psychology
demands a deeper meaning for such a motive   in this connection it would be
interesting to quote xenophon    as to love  his counsel was to abstain
rigidly from familiarity with beautiful persons  for he observed that it was
not easy to be in communication with such persons  and observe continence 
hearing  on one occasion  that critobulus  the son of criton  had kissed the
son of alcibiades  a handsome youth  he asked xenophon  in the presence of
critobulus  saying   tell me  xenophon  did you not think that critobulus
was one of the modest rather than the forward  one of the thoughtful rather
than of the thoughtless and inconsiderate   certainly   replied xenophon 
 you must now  then  think him extremely headstrong and daring  one who
would even spring upon drawn swords  and leap into the fire     and what  
said xenophon   have you seen him doing  that you form this opinion of him  
 why  has he not dared   rejoined socrates   to kiss the son of alcibiades 
a youth extremely handsome  and in the flower of his age    if such a deed  
returned xenophon   is one of daring and peril  i think that even i could
undergo such peril     unhappy man   exclaimed socrates   and what do you
think that you incur by kissing a handsome person  do you not expect to
become at once a slave instead of a freeman  to spend much money upon
hurtful pleasures   to have too much occupation to attend to anything
honourable and profitable  and to be compelled to pursue what not even a mad
man would pursue    by hercules   said xenophon   what extraordinary power
you represent to be in a kiss     do you wonder at this   rejoined socrates 
 are you not aware that the tarantula  an insect not as large as half an
obolus  by just touching a part of the body with its mouth  wears men down
with pain  and deprives them of their senses     yes  indeed   said
xenophon   but the tarantula infuses something when it bites    and do you
not think  foolish man   rejoined socrates   that beautiful persons infuses
something when they kiss  something which you do not see  do you not know
that the animal  which they call a handsome and beautiful object  is so much
more formidable than the tarantula  as those insects instil something when
they touch  but this creature  without even touching  but if a person only
looks at it  though from a very great distance  instils something of such
potency  as to drive people mad   perhaps indeed cupids are called archers
for no other reason but because the beautiful wound from a distance  but i
advise you  xenophon  whenever you see any handsome person  to flee without
looking behind you  and i recommend to you  critobulus  to absent yourself
from hence for a year  for perhaps you may in that time  though hardly
indeed  be cured of your wound   thus he thought that those should act with
regard to objects of love who were not secure against the attractions of
such objects  objects of such a nature  that if the body did not at all
desire them  the mind would not contemplate them  and which  if the body did
desire them  should cause us no trouble   for himself  he was evidently so
disciplined with respect to such matters  that he could more easily keep
aloof from the fairest and most blooming objects than others from the most
deformed and unattractive  such was the state of his feelings in regard to
eating  drinking  and amorous gratification  and he believed that he
himself  with self restraint  would have no less pleasure from them  than
those who took great trouble to pursue such gratifications  and that he
would suffer far less anxiety   15  

there is another interesting anecdote which is worthy of mention   the
syrian soothsayer and physiognomist  zopyrus  saw in the countenance of
socrates the imprint of strong sensuality   loud protests were raised by the
assembled disciples  but socrates silenced them with the remark   zopyrus is
not mistaken  however  i have conquered those desires     16  

it is also evident that socrates  mother must have played some role in his
mental life   it should be recalled that at first he followed his father s
profession  which seemingly made no impression upon him  and later he took
up his new vocation  preaching philosophy  which he loved to identify with
that of his mother  and indeed by reason of this the positive side of the
socratic method is known as  the art of intellectual midwifery     socrates
compared himself   writes schwegler   with his mother  phaenarete  a
midwife  because his office was rather to help others bring forth thoughts
than to produce them himself  and because he took upon himself to
distinguish the birth of an empty thought from one rich in content   17  

further evidence of the deep reverence for his mother is seen in memorabilia
where his eldest son  lamprocles  finds fault with his mother  and socrates 
though apparently entertaining very little love for his wife  yet takes up a
defensive attitude towards her and offers the following argument to his son 
 yet you are displeased at your mother  although you well know that whatever
she says  she not only says nothing with intent to do you harm  but that she
wishes you more good than any other human being  or do you suppose that your
mother meditates evil towards you    no indeed   said lamprocles   that i do
not imagine    do you then say that this mother   rejoined socrates   who is
so benevolent to you  who  when you are ill  takes care of you to the utmost
of her power that you may recover your health  and that you may want nothing
that is necessary for you  and who  besides  entreats the gods for many
blessings on your head  and pays vows for you  is a harsh mother  for my
part  i think that if you cannot endure such a mother  you cannot endure
anything that is good     18  

and in crito  socrates relates a dream shortly before his death  in which
his mother appeared  and to quote plato    crito says   and what can this
dream have been    socrates replied   i thought a woman came to me  tall and
fair  and clothed in white  and she called me and said  socrates  socrates 
in three days  time you will come to the fertile land  phthia     19  

to sum up briefly  the personality of socrates showed some psychopathic
traits   it must also be borne in mind that in that critical period  middle
age  a sudden change occurred in his mental life when he suddenly commenced
to exhibit profound interest in preaching philosophy   moreover  it must be
emphasized that he apparently reacted to hallucinations of an auto psychic
nature  the self asceticism  and most probably the mother complex cannot be
passed without mention   although he presented these negative qualities 
nevertheless he left a great school of philosophy  which beyond doubt is
still felt in the intellectual and moral world  despite this  athens
committed an unpardonable crime in putting socrates to death   he  like
other martyrs  shared the same fate of the mob  lowell s verse very justly
applies to socrates 

  truth forever on the scaffold   wrong forever on the throne   20  

with this characterization of socrates  we are now in a position to discuss
that part of his philosophy which has a definite bearing on modern
psychopathology   three important phases of his philosophy come under
consideration 

1  the dialectic method   2  the conception of virtue   3  know thyself 



the dialectic method

in socratic philosophy the dialectic method occupies a lofty position  by
this method he was enabled to penetrate deeply into human nature and unfold
all phases of man s experience   aristotle characterizes this method as the
induction of reasoning and the definition of general concepts  gomperz 
speaking of the great zeal that socrates exhibited in this method  says   to
him  socrates   a life without cross examination  that is  without dialogues
in which the intellect is exercised in the pursuit of truth  is for him not
worth living   21   and schwegler pertinently asserts  that through this art
of midwifery the philosopher  by his assiduous questioning  by his
interrogatory dissection of the notions of him with whom he might be
conversing  knew how to elicit from him a thought of which he had been
previously unconscious  and how to help him to the birth of a new
thought   22  

briefly stated  the dialectic method is divided into two parts  the negative
and the positive   the former is known as the socratic irony   by this
method the philosopher takes the position that he is ignorant and endeavors
to show by a process of reasoning that the subject under discussion is in a
state of confusion and proves to the interlocutor that his supposed
knowledge is a source of inconsistencies and contradictions 

on the other hand  the positive side of the method   the so called
obstetrics or art of intellectual midwifery  23  leads to definite
deductions   to illustrate the two phases of this method  the following
example may be taken   a youth of immature self confidence believed himself
to be competent to manage the affairs of state  socrates would then analyze
the general concept of the statecraft  and reduce it to its component parts 
and by continuous questions and answers would show to this supposed
statesman that he was lacking true knowledge   again  a young man of mature
judgment  but of an exceedingly modest temperament  being reluctant to take
part in the debates of the assembly  socrates would prove to him that he was
fully competent to undertake such a task 

in a word  the socratic method presents two striking tendencies  one
destructive  the other constructive  the former annihilates erroneous
conceptions  and the latter aids the building up of a healthy mental world 
in which men may find pleasure  in a broad sense  the dialectic method bears
some resemblance to the psychoanalytic  inasmuch as both seek to analyze
human nature in the light of individual experience  to find the ultimate and
predominating truth underlying such an experience  both attempt to make the
individual realize the extent of his limitations and capacity of adjustment
by subordinating the antagonistic forces and at the same time aiding the
construction of a world of healthy concepts 



socratic conception of virtue
before attempting to discuss the socratic conception of virtue  it is
important to call attention to two facts 

1st  the principles of mental life  and

2nd  the greek conception of the state 

roughly speaking  mental life is composed of two parts  the unconscious  or
instinctive  and the conscious   in the early development of the child 
mental adjustment is purely instinctive or unconscious  as the child grows
older  the unconscious life becomes gradually subordinated to the
conventional and cultural requirements  the influence of education 
religion  morality and environment begin to exert their influence upon the
child and the conscious life commences gradually to assert itself   the
characteristic difference between a very young child and the conventional
adult  lies in the fact that the former s behavior is not controlled by
conventionalities or tenets  whereas the latter conforms with all the rules
and customs of society 

the greeks entertained a very high idea of the function of the state  it was
invested with a high moral value and pedagogic aim  in fact  plato s
republic demonstrates this very well  an important point must be emphasized 
that the state exercised a potent influence upon the development of the
conscious life of the individual 

now we can understand the socratic conception of virtue in relation to the
conscious and unconscious life   what socrates maintained was that true
virtue must depend upon knowledge  hence knowledge is the strongest power of
man and cannot be controlled by passion   in short  knowledge is the root of
moral action  and  on the other hand  lack of knowledge is the cause of
vice  in other words  no man can voluntarily pursue evil  and to prefer evil
to good would be foreign to human nature   hence  in the socratic sense  in
the unconscious lies the root of antisocial deeds  and  as forbes puts it 
 socratic view of sin  in fact  keeps it in a region subliminal to
knowledge  the sinner is never more really than an instinctive man  an
undeveloped  irrational creature  strictly speaking  not a man at all   24  

since socrates identified virtue with knowledge  and made knowledge a
conscious factor in mental life  it is evident that education  environment 
religion and conventionality are the determining factors in the cultivation
of the conscious   what may be called institutional virtue   writes snyder 
 is for socrates the fundamental and all inclusive virtue  the ground of the
other virtues   he believes in the state  obeys the laws  performs his
duties as a citizen  this does not hinder him from seeing defects in the
existent state and its laws  and trying to remedy them   indeed  his whole
scheme of training in virtue is to produce a man who can make good laws  and
so establish a good state    what is piety   he asks  not a blind worship of
the gods  but worship of them according to their laws and customs  which one
must know  that is  one must know the law of the thing  the time of mere
instinctive action and obedience is past     25   and zeller expresses
himself in a similar manner    of the importance of the state and the
obligations towards the same  a very high notion indeed is entertained by
socrates   he who would live amongst men  he said  must live in a state  be
a ruler or be ruled  he requires  therefore  the most unconditional
obedience to the laws  to such an extent that the conception of justice is
reduced to that of obedience to law  but he desires every competent man to
take part in the administration of the state  the well being of all
individuals depending on the well being of the community  these principles
were really carried into practice by him throughout his life   with devoted
self sacrifice his duties as a citizen were fulfilled  even death being
endured in order that he might not violate the laws   even his philanthropic
labors were regarded as the fulfillment of a duty to the state  and in
xenophon s memorabilia we see him using every opportunity of impressing able
people for political services  of deterring the incompetent  of awakening
officials to their sense of their duties  and of giving them help in the
administration of their offices  he himself expresses the political
character of these efforts most tellingly  by including all virtues under
the conception of the ruling art   26  

to recapitulate briefly  the socratic conception of the unconscious conforms
in many respects with our present knowledge of it  especially insofar as our
psychoanalytic experience shows us conclusively what a potent factor is
exercised by the unconscious in the determination of psychotic and neurotic
phenomena  indeed in the socratic sense such manifestations are anti social
and cannot be identified with virtue  hence they are not conscious  one may
say that socrates unconsciously conceived the modern idea of the dynamics of
the unconscious 



know thyself

the great socratic maxim   know thyself   is one of the strongest moral
precepts in ethics   although the sophists had already called attention to
the fact that  man is the measure of all things   however they applied to
the individual and not to human nature in general   but socrates proclaimed
that this self knowing ego knows itself likewise as object  as the principle
of the world  in which man is to find himself in order to know it   27  

to know one s self implies calmness of self possession  fearlessness and
independence   furthermore it leads one to a striking realization of one s
limitations and shortcomings  which form the foundations of success  and  as
forbes expresses it   in this self knowledge is the secret of blessing and
success in the handling of human affairs  and right relationship with
others   28  

socrates  discussing his maxim with euthydemus  gives a clear and
comprehensive idea of this interesting subject    socrates then said   tell
me  euthydemus  have you ever gone to delphi     yes  twice   replied he 
 and did you observe what is written somewhere on the temple wall  know
thyself     i did     and did you take no thought of that inscription  or
did you attend to it  and try to examine yourself to ascertain what sort of
a character you are    i did not indeed try  for i thought that i knew very
well already  since i should hardly know anything else if i did not know
myself    but whether does he seem to you to know himself  who knows his own
name merely  or he who  like people buying horses  who do not think that
they know the horse that they want to know  until they have ascertained
whether he is tractable or unruly  whether he is strong or weak  swift or
slow  and how he is as to other points which are serviceable or
disadvantageous in the use of a horse so he   having ascertained with regard
to himself how he is adapted for the service of mankind  knows his own
abilities    it appears to me  i must confess  that he who does not know his
own abilities  does not know himself  

   but is it not evident   said socrates   that men enjoy a great number of
blessings in consequence of knowing themselves  and incur a great number of
evils  through being deceived in themselves  for they who know themselves
know what is suitable for them  and distinguish between what they can do and
what they cannot  and  by doing what they know how to do  procure for
themselves what they need  and are prosperous  and by abstaining from what
they do not know  live blamelessly  and avoid being unfortunate  by this
knowledge of themselves too  they can form an opinion of other men  and  by
their experiences of the rest of mankind  obtain for themselves what is
good  and guard against what is evil  

 but they who do not know themselves  but are deceived in their own powers 
are in similar case with regard to other men  and other human affairs  and
neither understand what they require  nor what they are doing  nor the
character of those with whom they connect themselves  but  being in error as
to all these particulars  they fail to obtain what is good  and fall into
evil 

 they  on the other hand who understand what they take in hand  succeed in
what they attempt  and become esteemed and honoured  those who resemble them
in character willingly form connections with them  those who are
unsuccessful in their affairs desire to be assisted with their advice  and
to prefer them to themselves  they place in them their hopes of good and
love them  on all these accounts  beyond all other men 

 but those  again  who do not know what they are doing  who make an unhappy
choice in life  and are unsuccessful in what they attempt  not only incur
losses and sufferings in their own affairs  but become in consequence 
disreputable and ridiculous  and drag out their lives in contempt and
dishonour   among states  too  you see that such as  from ignorance of their
own strength  go to war with others that are more powerful  are  some of
them  utterly overthrown  and others reduced from freedom to slavery   29  

what socrates attempts to show  is that self knowledge is conducive to human
happiness   indeed  sanity in a broad sense  depends upon insight into one s
true knowledge of his limitation and capacity for adaptation   however 
socrates holds that madness is not ignorance  but admits that for  a man to
be ignorant of himself  and to fancy and believe that he knew what he did
not know  he considered to be something closely bordering on madness  the
multitude  he observed  do not say that those are mad who make mistakes in
matters of which most people are ignorant  but call those only mad who make
mistakes in affairs with which most people are acquainted  for if a man
should think himself so tall as to stoop when going through the gates in the
city wall  or so strong as to try to lift up houses  or attempt anything
else that is plainly impossible to all men  they say that he is mad  but
those who make mistakes in small matters are not thought by the multitude to
be mad  but just as they call  strong desire   love   so they call  great
disorder of intellect   madness     30  

this socratic principle plays an important role in psychopathology  in
psychoanalysis  what the physician does is to acquaint the patient with the
unconscious mental processes  thus putting him in full knowledge of his
condition to enable him to adjust himself to his environment  in mental
diseases the prognosis of a psychosis is not looked upon so gravely when the
patient has some realization of his situation  and likewise the recovery
from a mental infirmity is more hopeful when the patient exhibits
considerable insight into his condition  it is a well known fact that in a
malignant psychosis  self knowledge does not exist  and this in part is
responsible for its malignancy  on the other hand the benignant nature of a
psychoneurosis may be in part attributed to the patient s appreciation of
his affliction 

however  the socratic maxim has another moral and social value  that is  by
only knowing one s self can one understand his fellowmen  indeed  plato
makes socrates say  in phaedrus  that it is ridiculous to trouble one s self
about other things when one is still ignorant of one s self   it is well
known to every psychoanalyst that a patient cannot be analyzed by the
physician unless the latter has conquered his own resistances and adjusted
his complexes  the immortal poet  shakespeare  truly says 

 this above all  to shine own self be true  and it must follow as the night
the day   thou canst not then be false to any man

psychoneuroses among primitive tribes   

    read by title at the sixth annual meeting of the american
psychopathological association  new york  n  y   may 5  1915 

by isador h  coriat  m  d  first assistant visiting physician for diseases
of the nervous system boston city hospital  instructor in neurology  tufts
college medical school

the complex construction of a psychoneurosis in an adult  due to the
influence exerted by the multiplicity of factors of civilization and
cultural advancement  is sometimes so bewildering as to almost defy all
attempts at analysis  in children  the organization of a psychoneurosis is
usually very simple  almost monosymptomatic  and in children too  we often
discover these neuroses in the actual process of making  when adult life is
reached  the individual has left behind him all the factors of his childhood
life and all the repressed experiences and desires which tend to produce his
adult characteristics  among adults of primitive races however  where the
mental organization is far less complex than that of civilized man  certain
psychoneurotic disturbances are found  which if analyzed  might disclose the
mental mechanisms of these disturbances reduced to their simplest terms 

it has been my good fortune to be able to secure data of this sort 
pertaining to certain curious nervous attacks which occur among the
primitive races of the fuegian archipelago   these facts were supplied me 
following along the lines of a questionnaire  by the well known explorer
charles wellington furlong  f  r  g  s   who in 1907 1908  was in charge of
the first scientific expedition to cross through the heart of tierra del
fuego   mr  furlong s keen powers of observation  have made the data
unusually complete  while he had no theory to offer in explanation of the
attacks as seen among these primitive tribes  yet it is interesting to note 
that certain of the facts corroborate the well known ideas of sexual
repression as elaborated by freud   the mental organization of these people
likewise  seems to substantiate certain psychoanalytic conceptions  for a
clear comprehension of these attack  certain preliminary anthropological and
geographical data are necessary 

the following data relates to the running amuck or outburst  among the
yahgan and ona tribes of the fuegian archipelago   this data was obtained in
1907 and 1908 during expeditions through the regions of the fuegian
archipelago 

the yahgans  some forty years ago  numbered perhaps 2 500 but in 1908 had
been reduced through contact with civilization and principally through an
epidemic of measles to 173  these peoples are canoe indians and inhabit
today the island coasts from beale island to the wollastons inclusive  in
the neighborhood of cape horn  from about 54 degrees 50  s  lat  to about 55
degrees 56  s  lat   making them the southern most inhabitants of the world 
the ona indians  a taller and finer race physically  who are foot indians 
occupy the mountain and forest regions of southern tierra del fuego from
approximately 53 degrees 50  s  lat  to 55 degrees 3  s  lat   the onas
formerly occupied the entire northern half of tierra del fuego and possibly
numbered some 3 000  but through contact and warfare with the whites  who
drove them south off the open lands of the north  they have been reduced to
about 300   these peoples are of a light cinnamon colored skin  black
haired  and of a decided amerindian type  the onas are above average
stature  the yahgans below it 

it is not an infrequent occurence for individuals among both the yahgans and
onas to be subject to sudden outbursts of furor and violence   at such times
the individual will generally dash from the wigwam and rush wildly away  and
will continue running until nearly or completely exhausted   the one
afflicted may dash madly through the woods or sometimes climb up dangerous
cliffs  at such times  however  it is the custom of some of the men to
follow closely behind to see that harm does not come through injury against
trees  stumbling  or falling from the cliffs  however  at such times they
rarely touch the afflicted one except to prevent harm  and finally will lead
him back to the camp  when the attack is over or when he is exhausted 

while the attack occurs both among men and women  it seems to be more
prevalent among men   the individuals in whom these attacks predominate are
men in the prime of life  ranging from 25 to 35 years of age  these people
are polygamous and as it is the custom for the old men to marry young girls 
thus leaving the old women to the younger men  which in many instances
causes a scarcity of women  it leaves a somewhat undesirable condition 

in many instances the character of the attack confines itself to the mad
rushing away  as above described  at other times attempts to injure or kill
others are made   for instance  a rancher of tierra del fuego  was in the
company of some onas when suddenly a hatchet whizzed by him  barely missing
his head  and buried itself in a log of the indian shelter  this was the
result of an attack which seized upon one of the onas who was afflicted thus
from time to time   the actual outburst in this case was sudden  although it
is difficult to tell how long it might have been coming on in the form of
brooding  which seems to be a premonitory phase of this condition 

concerning a personal experience with one of the early phases of an attack 
mr  furlong states as follows    i am fully convinced that one night  while
camping alone with onas in the heart of the fuegian forests  that my head
man aanakin  who had a good many killings to his credit  was brooding as he
sat in his wigwam  which opened towards the fire  he watched me for nearly
an hour with an attitude and expression which reminded me of the look a dog
takes on sometimes before he snaps  aanakin i knew to be of a very moody
nature but this particular mood was so marked and portended evil so
noticeably toward me without any apparent cause  that i decided to do
something to break its mental trend  so putting fresh wood on the fire  to
make a more brilliant blaze  i walked directly into his wigwam and motioned
to one of his two wives  who were lying beside him   there was a passing
look of half anger  half surprise  but i gave no time for his mind to dwell
in the same mood  for simultaneously i produced my note book and pencil and
began to make drawings of animals and other things they were familiar with 
they like to watch one draw and name the thing  and so i kept them busy for
perhaps an hour  and finally had them in gales of laughter  i am quite
convinced that i forestalled an attack or a condition akin to it  

it seems that an attack usually begins suddenly   however  an instance is
given where an ona became moody and realized that one of these attacks was
coming on and putting his hands together begged to have his wrists and feet
bound in order that he would not do himself or others any harm  or that it
would not be thought that he meant to kill and consequently be shot in self
defence  this would in a way seem to indicate that there was no amnesia for
the attack  as the indian undoubtedly realized what he had done in previous
attacks 

the moody state and the realization of what might follow as the attack comes
on demonstrates a sense of uneasiness as the premonitory symptom of an
attack  which ends in a state of utter exhaustion and sleep  the normal
condition is resumed  practically on the awakening from sleep and recovery
of strength 

from a description of donald mcmillan the explorer  the eskimo piblokto
strongly resembles these attacks of the ona and yahgan indians with the
exception that piblokto was particularly prevalent among the women 

how an attack begins is shown by the case of aanakin  an ona of furlong s
expedition   a certain form of melancholia  brooding or moodiness  seems to
precede many of these attacks  with a realization sometimes that an attack
is coming upon them  the onas not being naturally a quarrelsome people  it
may be that this realization and foreboding of the attack accounts for their
tendency to run away from their associates  when they have endured the
strain as long as they can  thus placing themselves in a position to avoid
deliberate attack or injury to those about them 

it was further stated  in answer to the questionnaire   i cannot give you
absolute data regarding laughing or crying in an attack  screaming  yells 
foaming at the mouth  biting of tongue  tearing of clothes  although i am of
the opinion that any or all of these things may and do occur  as to violent
resistance  the case  where the man wished to be bound  would show there was
violent resistance  and it is probable that partly for this reason the onas
and yahgans do not molest the afflicted except to prevent them from harming
themselves  preferring to wait until the paroxysm exhausts them   i cannot
state positively as to whether the attack is explained by the natives as
being due to an evil spirit  while these people are polygamous  though
having no religious form of worship  they usually believe when any one has a
disease that something has entered them or some one who dislikes them has
surreptitiously sent some small animal or an arrow into them  among the
yahgans the  yuccamoosh   doctors  or magicians proceed to pretend to
extract these objects by a form of squeezing and hugging the patient  in the
meantime blowing  hissing  etc   to force the object or evil out  i have
never known of their doing this  however  to a person suffering from an
attack 

 i am unable to supply any direct data as to the relation of love  hunger 
sexuality  death of relatives or absent relatives to an attack  on the death
of a relative the yahgans go through incantations in the form of a sort of
weird death chant  which they often sing in unison at certain times of the
day and night   they paint their faces to show the death to strangers  but
they rarely mention the name of the dead  in fact by most it is considered
an offence to do so  they say simply  he is gone    he is no more   they
feel the loss of relatives very keenly and sorrow for them  and sometimes
become violent with grief and rage 

 regarding the primitive type of mental organization among these
natives   despite darwin s first opinion of them  which was subsequently
modified  i consider these people inherently intelligent  though of a very
primitive type as far as their culture is concerned  probably the most
primitive in this hemisphere  perhaps in the world  as the onas are today
living in the stone age   dr  e  von hornbostel of berlin university  who
has collaborated with me in making a special study of my phonographic
records of their songs  informs me that these songs are the most primitive
american indian songs of which they have any record    of importance for a
clear understanding of the mental traits of these indian tribes  as the
source from which these attacks develop  are the study of their dreams 
their system of taboos and their myths  so far as could be determined from
the data supplied  the dreams of these primitive races strongly resemble the
dreams of children  as these aboriginal tribes possess many childlike
attributes  in fact up to a certain age the civilized child is really a
little savage  with his strong egotism and feelings of rivalry  his taboos 
his jealousies and his few or no altruistic tendencies  in the child as in
the savage  the wish and the thought are synonymous  both want their desires
immediately gratified  although such gratification may be impossible in
reality  the dreams of the yahgan indians are simple wish fulfilments 
without disguise or elaboration  like the dreams of a civilized child 

the yahgan attitude toward death is the same as that of many primitive
races  any reference to death is strongly tabooed amongst them and to
transgress this taboo  exposes the individual to grave danger and severe
punishment  even the punishment of the thing tabooed   thus the person who
transgresses this taboo becomes himself taboo by arousing the anger or
resentment of other members of the tribe   however  a certain ambivalent
tendency seems to be present  for while the word death and the mention of
the dead is prohibited  yet they feel deep grief and sorrow for dead
relatives   transgression of the taboo may arouse the other aspect of the
ambivalent attitude   for instance anger instead of sorrow  and it thus
becomes a source of danger to the guilty individual and so by contagion and
imitation to the community  this ambivalent tendency which leads to taboos
is prominent among primitive races as well as in civilized children for
instance  in the latter  the taboo of pronouncing certain words which leads
to stammering or the taboo of objects possessing a sexual significance in
producing kleptomania  as civilization and cultural advancement increase or
as the child becomes the adult  the taboo tendency gradually declines  yet
under certain conditions it may manifest itself as a psychoneurotic symptom 
since these particular primitive races have no conception of immortality 
this taboo cannot be a religious or a moral obligation or prohibition  but a
social phenomenon for the benefit of the tribe or for the physical welfare
of the individuals comprising the tribe   freud also has pointed out how the
avoidence of the names of the dead because of fear of offence to the living
is found among certain south american tribes 

a third factor of importance is a study of their myths   these are the
savage s day dreams   the relation between myths and dreams is well known 
both having their roots in the unconscious thinking of the race  in the
individual this unconscious mental process produces dreams  in the race and
society  myths   only one instance will be cited  the legend of the yahgan
indians concerning the creation of the first man and woman  when one of the
tribe was asked how the first human being came into the world  he replied
that a long time ago the first man came down from the sky on a rope and
later  the woman followed   here is a striking instance of how an adult
indian had applied his knowledge of individual births literally to a cosmic
process  a genuine creation myth as a form of symbolic thinking  there seems
little doubt in this case  that the sky  which to all savages appears like a
bowl  represented the uterus and the rope  the umbilical cord  the
resemblance of this myth to certain birth and parturition dreams  as
encountered in the psychoanalytic investigations of civilized adults  is
certainly striking 

how is this mass of material to be interpreted   the mental traits of these
people  as shown by an analysis of their taboos  myths and dreams  are very
primitive in organization  in fact  according to mr  furlong  they represent
the most primitive types of culture in the world and are today actually
living in the stone age   individuals of such primitive mental traits have
not learned to successfully repress their emotions and hence are liable to
sudden emotional outbursts  substitution and repression in civilized races
are utilized to cover our complex and multifarious ways of expressing our
social wishes and wants  in the savage there is little or no repression and
substitution  because his desires are simple and easily satisfied 

these primitive people therefore resemble children  without inhibitions or
repressions and hence their attacks of violence and furor as above described
are sudden emotional reactions  perhaps hysterical  but without any
phenomena of conversion  the relation of the attacks to an unsatisfied
sexual craving is shown by the fact that the attacks occur only in young men
whose libido remains unsatisfied  because according to tribal custom they
are compelled to marry old women  or  in the words of the explorer who lived
among these people   old derelicts   this factor  combined with the
observation that the victims of the attacks are free from loss of
consciousness and amnesia and the absence of an absolute evidence pointing
to foaming at the mouth or biting of the tongue  would seem to indicate that
the outburst was hysterical rather than epileptic in nature  it would thus
correspond to the piblokto of the eskimos as described by brill   this
resemblance was also noted by the explorer in his comparative description of
the two disorders 

it seems that the attacks themselves are motivated  not so much by the
actual gross sexual as by an ungratified or only partially gratified love
which would occur in a man who is compelled by social and tribal custom to
marry an old woman   among the eskimos this factor is at work in the women 
among the fuegians in the men  conversion phenomena were absent  because
their mental organization is very simple  in the same way that childhood
hysteria is free from conversion symptoms or at the most is monosymptomatic

two interesting cases of illusion of perception

by george f  arps

the ohio state university

the first case here reported came to the notice of the writer through the
attending physician  the second case was reported by the father of the child
after the attending physician had failed of satisfactory treatment  the
second case is especially interesting and serviceable in connection with the
phenomenon of visual space perception 

the first case is that of a boy  nine years of age  healthy  vigorous  who
in his play ground and street reactions parallels that of any normal boy of
his age   aside from measles and an occasional disturbance of digestion he
has been singularly free from childhood s common diseases  the father and
mother are strong hanoverian germans holding with puritanic strictness to
the dogmas of the lutheran religious faith  so far as is ascertainable there
can be no question of faulty inheritance  at least not so far as the
immediate parents and grandparents enter into the problem 

the child upon retiring and usually while still wide awake uttered wild
screams of terror   upon inquiry the child complained of falling and
clutched vigorously to the bed clothes and the arms of the parents   usually
the phenomenon disappeared when he was taken out of bed and walked about but
reappeared when he lay down  he complained of pain in his eyes  neck and
fore  and after parts of his head   no amount of persuasion dispelled the
illusion  it should be emphasized that the illusion occurred in full waking
state and rarely as a dream 

an attempt was made to correlate the illusion with the momentum of the day s
activity   according to the parents the illusion appeared in aggravated form
when the neighborhood boys congregated in a cluster of trees at the edge of
the village and when playing  train  in which case the barn top functioned
as the locomotive while a high board fence and an adjoining neighbor s barn
functioned as the cars and caboose respectively 

the village physician offered no explanation   he prescribed a hot bath and
a  closer supervision of the evening meal   the dilatation of the cutaneous
capillaries consequent to the bath lowered the cerebral circulation and to
some extent reduced the intensity of the illusion 

the cue to the cure appeared when the child  in expressing his fear 
complained because he could not see the parent who sat beside him on the
bed  upon lighting the room the child seemed pacified but still held tightly
to anything within reach   as a rule the illusion disappeared within thirty
minutes after illumination   it was then suggested that the child be put to
bed in a well lighted room   this was done but the phenomenon reappeared
although in a less aggravated form  degree of illumination and intensity of
the illusion appeared related  the phenomenon failed to appear at all when a
coal oil lamp was placed beside the bed not over two feet from the child s
head  for six months the boy went to sleep facing the full glare of the
lamp  gradually the lamp was removed until it occupied a position in the
hall  whenever the illusion recurred the lamp was replaced in its original
position 

it is quite probable that the intensity of the visual stimulus  the lamp 
deflected the nervous current from the neural processes underlying the
illusion and thus changed the direction of attention  any intense
distraction  other than the one employed  would probably have served the
same purpose   at the end of a year and a half the phenomenon entirely
disappeared 

the second case is that of a six year old girl  the daughter of highly
educated parents   with reference to this case two interesting phenomena
were observed    a  that of mirror writing of the common variety and  b 
that of ambiguous interpretation of the retinal impressions 

the phenomenon of mirror writing here observed parallels that of many other
cases in which the left right direction is reversed  these commoner cases
take on an added interest when considered in connection with a case of
double space inversion  such a case is on record  1  the double inversion
consists in writing all verbal symbols and digits up side down and backward 
in this case the boy had perfect pseudoscopic vision at the beginning of his
school work   stratton  by a system of lenses  artificially produces the
same distortions and throws some light on the phenomenon  2

ophthalmology  july  1914  vol  xxiii  p  482 

 2  psychological review  vol  iv  pp  341 360 and 463 481 

it is in the phenomenon of ambiguity in the interpretation of the retinal
eye processes that this case finds its value   at the dinner table the child
complained of the decrease in size of a number of objects in the room 
especially was this true of the apparent size of the father s head  the
frequency of the complaint led the father to seek the advice of an occulist
who pronounced the child s vision perfect in every way  over and over again
while seated at the dinner table the child would exclaim   o father how
small your head is  

the explanation of this phenomenon is found in the method employed to
dispell the illusion   it was suggested that  at the moment of the
appearance of the phenomenon  the child be requested to fixate the end of
the father s index finger which was revolved  in the air  to form various
geometrical figures   this had the desired effect  clearly we have here a
case of the object altering its apparent size without altering its distance 
under normal conditions a change in size is followed by a corresponding
change in the distance  it is probable that we have here inadequate
convergence and that the optic axes do not intersect at the object but
beyond  so that the axes are more or less parallel   thus the feeling of
convergence is less intense than experience teaches is necessary to perceive
the object as such a size and at such a distance  if degree of convergence
is a criterion for distance and if distance is a measure for the apparent
size of an object then we have the conditions necessary for the appearance
of the illusion 

here we have the retinal image constant for the apparent and the real size
of the object  head   obviously the retinal processes are constant for the
two interpretations of magnitude and the ambiguity is due to the concomitant
factor of convergence 

the conditions necessary to decrease the real size of an object while still
maintaining an unaltered image are produced without artificial means 
wheatstone  a long time ago  arranged his stereoscope so that a negative
correlation obtained between the degree of convergence and size of the
retinal image  3 

 3  philosophical transactions  1852 

very interesting is the fact that stratton demonstrated by artificial means
what was naturally the case in that of the boy reported in the annals
referred to above   wheatstone demonstrated by artificial means what was
naturally the case in that of the girl here reported

feeble mindedness  its causes and consequences   by h  h  goddard  the
macmillan co   n  y   1914   599 pp   illustrated 

two comprehensive attempts have been made in recent years to study the
inheritance of mental abnormality  one in england at the eugenics laboratory
of the university of london  the other in this country under the leadership 
more or less immediate  of the eugenics record office   both the english and
the american school of workers agree that different grades of mental
ability  mental defect and insanity are strongly inherited  but the two
schools have reached very different conclusions as to the manner of
inheritance of mental traits and mental defects  each school entertains
profound disrespect for the scientific methods and conclusions of the other
and with the frankness and honesty which devotion to truth demand has freely
criticised the other  by this criticism  at the bottom friendly though
sometimes caustic  science has undoubtedly profited   the later work of each
school begins to show the chastening influence of adverse criticism 

the english school has leaned backward in its devotion to the inductive
method of accumulating inheritance data  ostensibly without prejudice for or
against any particular theory but in reality with an ill concealed bias
against anything savoring of  mendelism    the american school recognizing
in mendelism a great advance and an important instrument for the discovery
of new truth  has ignored the possibility that other undiscovered laws of
heredity may exist and has cast aside as superfluous the valuable biometric
tools wrought with much patient toil by galton and pearson   it will be the
part of wisdom for students of genetics to imitate the hostile attitude of
neither school  but to utilize the positive results of both  this is what
dr  goddard has done in the work under review 

he apparently began studying the inheritance of feeble mindedness without
theoretical prejudice  but with a practical end in view  to discover  if
possible  the causes of feeble mindedness so as to deal intelligently with
the inmates of the vineland  n  j   institution with which he is connected 
goddard received inspiration and suggestion from the mendelian principles
which dominate the work of the eugenics record office  but has published his
observations in detail so that the reader may test by them any theory he
likes  this method can not be too highly commended for it gives permanent
value to the publication  however much prevailing theories may change  the
book contains a detailed study of 327  cases   each being the family history
of a different inmate of the vineland institution  as made out by trained
investigators who visited the homes of the inmates and held interviews with
their parents  relatives  friends and neighbors  english criticism of
american work of this sort had prepared the reader to expect carelessness of
method and inaccuracy in the accumulation of data  but dr  goddard is
evidently on his guard against this  he goes very fully into the method of
obtaining and verifying the data  and in doing so gives a very strong
impression that the data are  reliable   his treatment of the data is also
cautious but thorough  so that when he works his way to a conclusion it
stands firmly established  the conclusions reached are numerous and
important  but the one of greatest theoretical interest is this  that
feeble mindedness is inherited as a simple recessive mendelian
unit character  this conclusion  so far as earlier publications were
concerned  might be regarded as insufficiently established  but the evidence
presented in this work renders it  i think  beyond question   goddard was
himself apparently considerably surprised at the conclusion reached  he had
expected to find different kinds or grades of mental defect independently
inherited as units and confesses to leanings toward views of the
physiological independence of different mental functions  but his  cases 
give him no evidence of such inheritance   he finds only that feeble minds
are minds of arrested development in regard to all functions  and that
different grades of feeble mindedness correspond with different stages of
normal mental development completely arrested  how different grades may
occur in one and the same mendelian unit is apparently a puzzle to goddard 
who does not attempt its explanation  it is indeed an absurdity to the  pure
line  mendelian  but not to one who appreciates the fact that mendelian
units are subject to quantitative variation sometimes continuous  sometimes
discontinuous  an example of the former is found in the hooded pattern of
rats  4  of the latter in albinism and other mendelizing characters which
assume multiple allelomorphic conditions  5  pearson has steadfastly refused
to admit that albinism in man is a mendelizing character  because it may
assume various forms ranging from colorless to quite heavily pigmented
conditions  blondes   we now find that albinism in guinea pigs shows an even
greater range of variation  6  yet there can be no doubt of its fundamental
unity as a mendelian character  each grade of which is allelomorphic to
every other grade and to normal pigmentation

 6  wright  s  amer  nat   march  1915 


goddard s findings as regards feeble mindedness fit in perfectly with this
scheme   that goddard was unaware of it when his conclusions were reached is
all the more evidence of their soundness because it shows that they were
reached independently  among albinos every higher grade of pigmentation
dominates all the lower grades in inheritance  and so apparently it is with
mental development  the higher grades dominate the lower  at every point
there appears to be agreement in method of inheritance between albinism and
feeble mindedness  each is a unit character but showing graded allelomorphic
conditions which correspond probably with different stages of arrested
development of pigmentation or mentality respectively 

the fact noted by goddard that the feeble minded resemble savages  that is
backward races of low mentality  has much interest to the student of
evolution   it indicates that the evolution of intelligence has occurred by
a gradual progressive advancement  stages in which reappear as the higher
grades of feeble mindedness  of course it is not certain that the
ontogenetic stages  at which mental development may be arrested  correspond
accurately with earlier phylogenetic stages  but the idea receives
considerable support from the observed resemblance between the mentality of
morons and that of savage peoples  if the observation may be accepted as
accurate   i do not understand however that goddard makes any claim to
first hand familiarity with the mental life of savages  so that no great
emphasis should be laid on the point  but the mere fact that retrogressive
variation in mentality is graded favors the view that its progressive
evolution has been gradual  rather than the view that it has arisen by
mutation or sudden loss of inhibitors    bateson  davenport  

goddard points out that a high grade moron may be a useful and
self supporting member of society in some environments  usually rural 
whereas he would be quite helpless in the keen competition of urban life 
this suggestion leads the reader to wonder whether many peasant and peon
populations of the old and new world represent survivals of an older and
lower grade of mental evolution than has been attained in the more advanced
nations  or whether it is merely lack of opportunity that makes these
populations backward   the fact that in every generation great men come from
the lower social levels shows that the lower classes are not entirely devoid
of capacity  nevertheless it seems probable that a low grade of intelligence
would stand a better chance of escaping elimination in the struggle for
existence when placed in a simple environment than when placed in a complex
one   consequently  under modern conditions  we might expect a peasant or
peon population to average lower in mental capacity than a community more
advanced in civilization  whether the peasant population would equal in
average intelligence a band of north american indians or a tribe of native
new zealanders is very doubtful  for in such peoples natural selection for
intelligence was undoubtedly severe because of their intense struggle with
nature and with other tribes  unaided by the accumulated knowledge and tools
of civilized communities  among such peoples greater demands were probably
made on inborn intelligence than among modern industrial populations 

as regards the causes of feeble mindedness goddard s findings are wholly
negative  but not less valuable on that account   his case histories
statistically studied indicate no causal relation to a number of reputed
agencies in the creation of feeble mindedness  such as alcoholism  which he
regards as oftener a symptom than a cause   tuberculosis  sexual immorality 
insanity  syphilis  accident and consanguinity  he recognizes heredity as
its principal source  i   e   he recognizes feeble mindedness as a stage of
mentality already existing and transmissible by the ordinary mechanism of
heredity  but does not attempt further to account for it  either as a
survival or as an atavism 

that humanitarian governments by shielding and supporting the moron without
putting a limit on his naturally high reproduction will speedily increase
this class at the expense of the more intelligent classes of the community
is self evident  if it is admitted that feeble mindedness is hereditary  as
all who have investigated the matter carefully now declare  goddard shows
further that a large percentage  probably more than half  of the alcoholism 
pauperism  prostitution  and crime  of the united states are directly
traceable to hereditary feeble mindedness  another strong reason for taking
measures to reduce it 

how is this to be done   goddard has no cure all to offer but urges first of
all that the mental grade of each individual be accurately determined and
education and occupation be provided suited to his capacity  this will tend
to make the moron a useful and contented member of the community  not a
menace to it   segregation is recommended so far as practicable  but in view
of the large number  estimated at 300 000 to 400 000 in the u  s   goddard
considers segregation of all impracticable  nevertheless he urges further
and energetic efforts in this direction  that as many as possible may be
segregated as a safeguard against their reproduction  in individual cases
 sterilization wisely and carefully practiced  must be employed to insure
non reproduction 

in this volume there is a pleasing absence of the rant which pervades some
eugenic literature   the author has something of importance to contribute to
science and he presents his contribution in a sober  dignified manner in
keeping with the important character of his contribution  w  e  castle 



christianity   the sources of its teaching and symbolism   by j  b  hannay 
 francis griffiths  london  pp  394  

this is an attempt to expound the symbolism of the christian religion  it is
divided into three main parts   ancient cults  phallism and sun worship  
ancient cults in the old testament  ancient cults in the new testament   the
author s main thesis can be stated in a sentence  the essential constituents
of every religion  and the underlying meaning of its symbolism  are
phallicism and sun worship  of these the former is the more important  more
primary  and more wide spread  the latter is a superimposed layer better
adapted to more civilized and educated people  but rarely penetrating into
the hearts of the common people to the extent that the former has   the
great branches under which all the religious systems of the past have
developed may be classed as based  on the one hand on the consideration of
our world and the continuity of life upon it  expressed in phallic
symbolism  and on the other hand  on the sun as the great giver and
sustainer of man  expressed in solar symbolism    p  21    as the phallic
cult was much the older  it retained its position after the rise of the
solar cult   it required a much higher intelligence to grasp the facts of
solar worship  so it never entered the  hearts  of the common people as did
the phallic worship  but it had a much more intelligent priesthood  and was
the arbiter in all questions of dates  and regulated al  feasts  and  what
was more important to the people  fixed the time for payments of debts or
interest  and regulated the times of sowing and harvesting  so it became a
much more  official  religion than phallism    in support of these
conclusions the author marshals a huge number of facts  so that the work
becomes a veritable encyclopaedia of symbolism 

now in spite of the fact that the reviewer fully accepts the main thesis of
the book  as stated above  and therefore has no prejudice or hostility on
the score of the conclusions encunciated being distasteful  his judgment of
the book is entirely unfavourable  for the following reasons  in the first
place  any presence of the book to be a scientific  and therefore impartial 
contribution to knowledge is invalidated by the author s moral bias evident
from beginning to end  against religion in general  and christianity in
particular  which he maintains is the most phallic of all religions  his
point of view is that of the older rationalists  to whom religion is nothing
but an unfortunate instinct for  delight in the miraculous   expressing
itself in phallic and sun worship  and fostered by the exploiting tendencies
of priests  his desire seems to be  in writing the book  to  show up 
religion and  by discrediting it  hasten its end 

in the second place  there is not a single new idea in all its closely
packed pages  and therefore no excuse for writing them  since the material
here laboriously brought together is easily accessible in other books  it
never seems to dawn on the author that pointing out the sexual basis of
religion  which countless other writers have already done  is but the
beginning of the problem  the starting point of all sorts of complex
riddles  having dogmatically divided all religious symbols into male and
female  he is self satisfied enough to think that he has explained religion 
there is no inkling of the points of view suggested by such words as
determinism  significance  genesis  so familiar to the modern psychologist 

side by side with all this goes a disorderly arrangement and very imperfect
powers of criticism   the latter feature is especially marked in the field
of etymology  where the author fairly lets himself run wild  the following
gem is a typical example  p  110    bacchus became degraded into the god of
wine  and his fetes became drunken orgies  but he was originally the
beneficent sun who ripened the fruits  and hence god of wine  from which 
indeed  is derived the english name of all our gods  angels  prophets  or
even parsons    divines    dei vini    gods of wine    jesus was the  true
vine  

the merits of the book are that it may direct the attention of some people
to the connection between sex and religion  if there are any who are still
unaware of this  and that it possesses a good index that may be useful to
readers with limited facilities for looking up particular symbolisms  it is
also well illustrated   ernest jones 



laughter   an essay on the meaning of the comic   henri bergson   translated
by c  brereton and f  rothwell    macmillan  london  1913   pp  200  

in this stimulating little book professor bergson propounds his theory of
the comic  which is shortly to the following effect  noting first that
laughter is purely a human phenomenon  and therefore probably has a social
significance  he seeks for this by trying to define what are the essential
features of the comical  he reduces the various characteristic features in
the main to one  namely  automatism on the part of the comical person or
thing   this automatism is of a special kind  especially is it an automatism
that is out of place  that occurs at the expense of spontaneity  vitality 
and freshness  it may thus be defined as  something mechanical in something
living    a kind of absentmindedness on the part of life     the comic is
that side of a person which reveals his likeness to a thing  that aspect of
human events which through its peculiar inelasticity  conveys the impression
of pure mechanism  of automatism  of movement without life     to imitate
anyone is to bring out the element of automatism he has allowed to creep
into his person  and as this is the very essence of the ludicrous  it is no
wonder that imitation gives rise to laughter    this bald statement of
bergson s conclusion is  in the reviewer s opinion  made very convincing by
the delicate analysis he proffers of numerous illustrations 

up to this point bergson s theory of the comic fairly well coincides with
that of freud   the latter author  it is true  summarises his conclusions in
different language  but the meaning is not very different   for him the
feeling of comicality is an  economy of ideational expenditure   and it is
evoked by the sight of another person who in a given performance displays
either a lack of mental activity or an excess of physical  i e   who is
either stupid or clumsy  compare this formulation with bergson s  the latter
says that the opposite of the comic is gracefulness  rather than beauty   it
partakes rather of the unsprightly than of the unsightly  of rigidness
rather than of ugliness    the replacement of mental by physical activity is
insisted on in the following passage   any incident is comic that calls our
attention to the physical in a person  when it is the moral  i  e   mental 
that is concerned   again  he compares a comical person to  a person
embarrassed by his body    his automatism is essentially a lack of mental
nimbleness  a formal lack of mental elasticity  a defective capacity for
rapid adjustment  in short  a mental laziness  and especially is this defect
one of consciousness   the failure is on the part of the higher mental
activities  which should be the most alert  and what happens is a relapse
into unconscious  automatic modes of functioning  a form of absentmindness 
 the comic is that element by which the person unwittingly betrays
himself  the involuntary gesture or the unconscious remark  absentmindedness
is always comical   systematic absentmindedness  like that of don quixote 
is the most comical thing imaginable               no one can be comical
unless there be some aspect of his person of which he is unaware  one side
of his nature which he overlooks  on that account alone does he make us
laugh  

in substantial agreement on this general conclusion as to mental rigidity
and bodily clumsiness  the two views diverge from here  according to
bergson  the comic presupposes  something like a momentary anaesthesia of
the heart    laughter is incompatible with emotion   for freud this absence
of emotion is much more characteristic of humour than of the comic  two
matters that bergson quite fails to distinguish   then  whereas freud
explains the subjective side of the comic purely on hedonic principles 
bergson sees in it an important social function   according to him  laughter
is one of society s weapons for dealing with tendencies that threaten to
diverge from the conventional and accepted norm  it  restrains eccentricity 
and  corrects unsociability    any individual is comic who automatically
goes his own way without troubling himself about getting into touch with the
rest of his fellow beings  it is the part of laughter to reprove his
absentmindness and wake him out of his dream         each member must be
ever attentive to his social surroundings  he must model himself on his
environment  in short  he must avoid shutting himself up in his own peculiar
character as a philosopher in his ivory tower  therefore society holds
suspended over each individual member  if not the threat of correction  at
all events the prospect of a snubbing  which  although it is slight  is none
the less dreaded  such must be the function of laughter        it represses
separatist tendencies     unsociability in the performer and insensibility
in the spectator  such  in a word  are the two essential conditions   this
interesting theory leaves some questions unanswered  why  for instance 
should onlooking society remain emotionally cold in one case  and merely
laugh  and in another case adopt much graver measures   bergson deals with
this point rather imperfectly  it is not the seriousness of the case that
decides  for  we now see that the seriousness of the case is of no
importance either  whether serious or trifling  it is still capable of
making us laugh  provided that care be taken not to arouse our emotions  
nor is it the immoral nature of the deviation from the normal   the comic
character may  strictly speaking  be quite in accord with stern morality 
all it has to do is to bring itself into accord with society     it is the
faults of others that make us laugh  provided we add that they make us laugh
by reason of their unsociability rather than of their immorality    the most
specific criterion seems  in bergson s opinion  to be that of vanity   it
might be said that the specific remedy for vanity is laughter  and that the
one failing that is essentially laughable is vanity  

we may briefly refer to some other matters dealt with more incidentally 
wit  and the relation of the comic to art and to dreams  the discussion of
wit is perhaps the weakest part of the book  no analysis is given of the
different forms of wit  and the important subject of what may be called its
technique is quite passed by  wit is identified in a superficial manner with
the comic in general  the fundamental differences between the two  which
freud has dealt so exhaustively with  being altogether ignored  bergson
gives a more interesting and profitable study of the relation of the comic
to art  especially of the nature of comedy as distinct from other forms of
drama   according to him  comedy portrays character types rather than
individual persons  he repeatedly insists on this point  adding that  it is
the only one of all the arts that aims at the general  so that once this
objective has been attributed to it  we have said all that it is and all
that the rest cannot be    further   comedy lies midway between art and
life   it is not disinterested as genuine art is  by organizing laughter 
comedy accepts social life as a natural environment  it even obeys an
impulse of social life  and in this respect it turns its back upon art 
which is a breaking away from society and a return to pure nature    the
discussion of the relation of the comic to dreams is  on the other hand 
less satisfying   comic absurdity is stated to be of the same nature as that
of dreams   the main point of resemblance seems to be that in both cases
there occurs an absence of social contact  in both there is a mental
relaxation from the effort of  seeing nothing but what is existent and
thinking nothing but what is consistent   this really applies much more to
wit than to the comic itself 

as may be expected  the whole book is written in professor bergson s
pleasing style  and is full of suggestive hints and fresh points of view 
the most significant contribution  one which pervades the book throughout 
is the view of laughter as a social censor  even if this hypothesis is
substantiated by detailed investigation  however  it cannot rank as a
complete theory of laughter  or of the comic  until it is supplemented by
some explanation  not given by the author  of the most striking feature of
laughter  its capacity for yielding pleasure 

it only remains to say that the translation is literally excellent  ernest

this special number of the american journal of insanity contains the
exercises and papers delivered at the opening at the phipps psychiatric
clinic at the johns hopkins hospital  baltimore  md   the contents of the
entire volume should prove to be of the greatest interest to all students
and lovers of psychiatry   the volume opens with a brief but fitting
introduction by dr  adolf meyer  director of the clinic  a man to whom
american psychiatry owes so much for the stimulus and inspiration which he
has injected into others   this is followed by a word of appreciation by
henry d  harland  president trustees  the johns hopkins hospital  some brief
remarks on the psychiatric clinic and the community by stewart paton  the
heart to heart talk on specialism in the general hospital by sir william
osler  and a short talk on the purpose of the psychiatric clinic by prof 
adolf meyer   there then follow a series of fascinating and inspiring
papers  as follows   the sources and direction of psychophysical energy  by
william mcdougall  autistic thinking by e  bleuler  personality and
psychosis by august hoch  the personal factor in association reactions by
frederic lyman wells  a study of the neuropathic inheritance by f  w  mott 
on the etiology of pellagra and its relation to psychiatry by o  rossi 
psychic disturbances associated with disorders of the ductless glands  by
harvey cushing  primitive mechanisms of individual adjustment by stewart

george h  kirby  anatomical borderline between the so called syphilitic and
metasyphilitic disorders in the brain and spinal cord by charles b  dunlap 
and mental disorders and cerebral lesions associated with pernicious anemia
by albert moore barrett   the number is concluded by the penetrating closing
remarks of prof  adolf meyer 

the papers by mott  rossi  cushing and heilbronner are of the greatest
interest   the discussions by mcdougall and bleuler are fascinating and
uplifting   mcdougall s paper is a masterpiece   kirby  jones and hoch
present us with the modern standpoints in the conception of the psychoses 
throughout the volume one sees the adoption of the broad biological
standpoint in mental life   the adoption of the term  biogenetic psychoses 
is indicative of the general trend  the adoption of this well chosen phrase
is  i venture to suggest  the product of dr  meyer 

the reviewer regrets that the papers do not very well lend themselves for
brief reviews   furthermore  he would not attempt to briefly present the
views which have been so lucidly and succinctly expressed by the individual
writers 

prof  meyer is to be commended for the very splendid program presented at
the opening exercises of the phipps psychiatric clinic 

may it be a lasting inspiration for those who drink at the fountain of

the object of this paper is to carry the analysis of stutter phenomena
deeper than before   in my last year s paper i showed that chronologically
the diagnosis of dyslalia mounted step by step from a material external
affair  up through the nerves until we came to the basal ganglia   i showed
conclusively that it was an involvement that did not exist in any of these
places  i further took steps to demonstrate and present evidence that
indicated that dyslalia was in its essence some trouble with the
personality  i mean by this   that the trouble was located in the nervous
system beyond the lower sensory areas of the sensorium  and also above the
lower motor areas on the motor side  by the broad term  personality  i mean
the total of the activities and interrelations of mental activities that
occur above our lower sensory and motor areas   the paper of last year
clearly located the trouble vaguely in this region of the personality 

since that time i have been interested to ascertain just what the nature of
this changed personality is   in order to do so  i have carried on an
investigation that has reached interesting conclusions  to me it is new
truth   it may not be all the truth  but as far as it goes  and as for what
it is  it surely is truth and a new finding  this research is an effort to
show not only where it is but what it is 

the method was as follows   for the purpose of finding out some of the
activities going on in the area of collaboration during speech  i asked my
stuttering patients two simple questions  i thus found that their methods of
collaboration complied to a certain mental type 

then i carried this same method into the study of normal individuals in the
collaboration of their ideas  just before and during speech in order to
establish a norm  and to see whether or not it differed from my preliminary
test of stuttering cases just mentioned  it did  and therefore i formulated
a series of questions in order to pin the type of collaboration down to
certain fields of mental action  to make this clear  let me present an
outline of these different steps in tabular form 

     1  orientation tests on stutterers 
     2  orientation tests on normal individuals 
     3  the research  its objects and methods 
     4  final detailed results 

let us now pass to a minuter description of each of these procedures and a
tabulation of the data that resulted 

1   psychological orientation tests on stutterers 

by orientation test i mean simply a vague try out to see just where the
problem lies  an initial step to see what further steps are necessary  or in
other words enough of an investigation to know where to look next 

the orientation tests consisted in requesting a series of twenty stuttering
cases to answer two questions  following their answers an immediate
inspection was made of the content of their consciousness before  during 
and after speech  these two questions were as follows 

     1  where do you live 
     2  say after me  the dog ran across the street  

after these questions i asked the patients to state whether there was any
picture in the content of consciousness and how long it lasted  also whether
that was detailed  intense or weak   i noted the presence of stuttering in
relation to the presence or absence of this mental imagery  and also made a
note of any other unusual data that happened  the results of the tests
indicated above can be summarized as follows 

of the twenty stutterers examined  ten made no visualization of their homes 
some even after a residence of years  one of these twenty visualized home
very faintly  two others visualized home clearly but the picture vanished on
speaking  seven others visualized home clearly but these had been under
treatment 

on repeating the dog statement  ten stutterers made no visualization
whatever  one visualized faintly  four visualized well but the picture
vanished on speaking  five others reported visualization  and four of these
had been under treatment 

at first i did not know but what this was the norm of average visualization
methods  so i tried this same series upon a number of normal individuals for
comparison  by normal individuals  i mean  at this time  merely anyone who
is free from stuttering  and chosen in a haphazard way from the hospital
community  for example  one was our executive secretary  another a
typewriter  another a telephone operator and so on 



2   psychological orientation tests on normal individuals

the results of these orientation tests upon normal individuals were as
follows 

the normal individuals examined almost without exception visualized clearly
before and during speech   sometimes this visualization was very marked in
detail and resulted in emotional responses  such as pleasures  etc 

from the above two sets of figures were thus obtained a fair norm of
visualization for ordinary individuals  and in comparison a marked variation
from this in stutterers  this data therefore warranted the tentative
conclusion that stutterers have a loss or diminished power of visualization 
this assertion may seem a little more than is warranted by such meagre data
and perhaps would be better revised pending further data into the following 
as compared with the normal  stutterers show a weakness in visualization 



3   the research  its objects and methods 

these general orientation tests for a norm and its pathological variation
were the basis upon which i proceeded on broader lines with a further and
more exhaustive investigation with the following points in view 


to what extent is visualization weak 

is it weaker in the worst cases 

is it less and less weak as cases appear less severe 

is it the same for past  present and future memories 

is visualization equally at fault in all sensory areas of the cortex 

do cases approach normal visualization processes in proportion as they
progress in their cure  and

lastly  numerous other minor queries presented themselves 

all these questions were answered in the following research  which after
thus much orientation found a more complete and final form 

in order to answer these questions i formulated the following series of
tests to the number of twenty four in all  and asked them in series to
nineteen stutterers  making almost four hundred tests 

     1  speech 
        say  today is sunny 
        the dog ran across the street 
        submarines will sink all the steamers 

     2  motor 
        do you dance 
        did you ever skate 
        would you sew for a living 

     3  general sensory 
        how does a pinch feel 
        did you ever get hurt 
        what would you like to do if it was very hot next summer 

     4  hearing   eyes closed 
        do you hear anything 
        did you ever hear a rooster crow 
        what sounds would you like to hear next summer 

     5  sight   eyes closed 
        what do you see now 
        what did you see yesterday 
        what would you like to see next summer 

     6  smell   eyes closed   pen to nose 
        do you smell anything 
        what have you told by smell 
        what would you like to smell next summer 

     7  taste   eyes closed 
        do you taste anything 
        what have you been able to tell by the taste 
        what would you like to taste next summer 

     8  muscle sense   eyes closed 
        put one arm up  the other like it 
        put one arm up  down  the other like it 
        how would you hold a hand to read from it 

this long series of questions with careful introspection tests upon the
content of consciousness constituted then my main research in the field of
stuttering   perhaps further details in explanation of the questions chosen
is unnecessary  three or more questions on introspection were asked at each
test 

4   final detailed results are found in the following conclusions as drawn
from 1440 answers 

in our average conversation a visual picture is created before we begin
utterance   severe stutterers never visualize at all  in direct proportion
that these cases become less severe  does visualization increase in
frequency  strength and continuation in consciousness before and during
utterance 

when severe stutterers are free from spasms they visualize  and when they
stutter they do not visualize 

when mild cases are free from spasms  they visualize  and when they stutter
they fail to visualize 

in a word  when visualization is present stuttering is absent  when
visualization is absent stuttering is present 

this is true not only of each utterance  in most cases  but is true of
severe as well as mild forms as a whole 

stutterers gain in visualization as they approach cure 

for past  present and future memories   visualization is slightly more
frequent for past and future 

therefore stuttering is an indication of absent or weak visualization either
in isolated words  occasional stutterers  mild stutterers or the severest
type  either before or during speech  or both 

the slump  then  in personality which i showed last year as the main thing
in stuttering as its cause and condition  is thus found by further
psychological analysis  to be a slump in the power to consciously visualize 

by personality i mean as mentioned above the composite of collaborative
activities that lie between the low sensory repository areas and the low
motor expression areas   in other words  personality includes all those
collaborative processes that lie between the sensory intake areas and the
motor output areas  in a word  any unexpressed use the mind makes of its
intake  conscious visualization is a part of personality processes  then  in
my last year s paper  1   the whole matter was left vague  here something
definite and constant is found   in other words the psychoanalytical method
revealed no conscious subconscious cause  granted there is room here to
 interpret   or create according to freudian mechanisms  a definite
subconscious complex  a step which i could not feel justified in taking  i
leave this to better psychoanalysts than i  for me to twist stutter
phenomena to comply to a theoretical complex is unscientific to say the
least  but the psychological method  as represented by this paper  shows a
definite constant cause for all the phenomena of stuttering 

faulty visualization explains all phenomena 

upon this basis of an involved visualization all the intricate phenomena of
stuttering may be explained   let us take some of these up in detail 

the start   visualization processes are a matter of growth through exercise
and development and use from the sensory area mostly of the eye  if these
processes in their early start and evolution receive a setback through the
treatment of people in the environment  such as interruptions of their early
speech efforts  constant inattention of those to whom they speak  and
persistent refusal by older people to answer questions propounded or the
allowing of the little one to ask the same question without hopes of answer
for a great number of times  these visualization processes receive a
setback   this kind of treatment in the home is one of the chief causes of
the slump of visualization processes  another cause is hearing other
stutterers interrupt their own visualization processes as they stutter  and
still other minor causes may be almost any psychic trauma  these traumata 
such as an operation  an accident or a severe illness  are sufficient to
bring to the surface or intensify a growing lack of visualization that has
been started by bad environment long before 

the development of stuttering   when the habit of visualization is lessened 
the action upon speech is the same as the withdrawal of an inhibiting or
regulating reflex arc 

it is thus that visualization processes act like reflex inhibition  when
visualization is present a higher inhibition arc is functioning and we have
a normal speech as a consequent reflex expression  when and in proportion as
visualization is absent this higher inhibition arc is not functioning  and
the speech thus uncontrolled flies away in spasms which we call stutter  it
should be called an exaggerated or uninhibited speech reflex 

the stutter  then  is merely the externalization of an exaggerated reflex of
motor speech  exaggerated through the loss of the inhibitory action of a
more or less weakened visualization process 

not only does this explain the phenomena at large but seems to be a
satisfactory explanation for all its intricate  minute details  some
examples may  perhaps  be welcome at this point  i say to two stutterers 
 tell your first name    one of them stutters and the other one does not 
on furthering questioning  it is found that the one who did not stutter
visualized  and the one who did stutter did not visualize 

concrete   these conditions are also seen when stutterers talk about
concrete and abstract matters or when they promulgate some important plea
that cannot be visualized  on concrete matters that can be easily visualized
the stuttering is gone  and on abstract matters where visualization is hard 
the stuttering again appears 

anger   in anger  when an intense visual picture is presented and occupies
the mind  there is then no stuttering  and also in other similar situations
there are periods when the individual is abandoned to some visual concept
which acts in the same manner 

singing   we all know that stutterers can sing without stuttering  the
process here is a similar one  only that there is held up over the speech
before utterance an auditory image of a melody in place of the visual image
as held in normal speech  this auditory image may be more easily applicable
as supplying the needed inhibition reflex arc than the visual because it is
nearer to the speech area 

prayer   for the same reason prayer is uttered without stuttering when there
is faith enough in a god to hold an image of him during utterance  there may
also be other images held during prayer 

familiar sights   familiar sights are less stuttered upon than the detailing
of situations that are less familiar and therefore can be less well
visualized   this is also true of sights that have been recently seen or
that have been repeatedly seen  or that in some other way have been made
intense as pictures in the visual field 

as cure proceeds   in the process of recovery where visualization is seen to
increase as the stutter decreases  there is another illustration where this
visualization attitude explains the whole situation  i have taken a severe
stutterer and told him a story that could be well pictured  got him to work
up the pictures properly by several complicated processes  which we will not
consider now  and when he had them well in hand  i have seen him stand up
and relate the story from beginning to end with little or no stuttering if
at any point he would trip up  the inevitable confession would be that at
that point he dropped the picture  or  in other words  the visualization
could not be held over in its inhibitory action  and therefore the stutter
came   on further request to hold it over that point  the same passage would
be again expressed smoothly if he succeeded in holding the picture 

this constancy  this presence and absence of the picture  its presence to
make smooth talk and its absence to cause stuttering  is so constant at
every turn of the situation  that i would offer it as a new interpretation
of all these phenomena  i know of no other interpretation that can explain
everything under one head as does this absence  weakness or interruption of
visualization processes 

terminology   we have found in our orientation tests that in a vague way the
visualization was at fault   we have also found in normal individuals that a
marked visualization was an automatic process that preceded speech  and
lasted during utterance  and we have found in the long series of stutterers
that visualization is entirely absent in severe cases  that it is weak in
milder forms  that it is intermittent in most cases  and that on words that
are smooth it always appears  and in occasional stutter it is as
occasionally absent 

we have also found that the form of visualization common in normal speech is
the visualization of eye sensations  that in unusual situations we may have
visualizations from other sense areas  such as the ear  taste or smell  but
these are the rare exception 

from all this data it would naturally follow that some sort of term is
needed to designate this condition  last year i probed to find such a term
without much success 

at present i see no reason why it should not be called an asthenia  it is
surely the weakening of a mental process that is strong in normal
individuals   the evidence here presented shows that  i doubt whether there
is any marked pathological change  since the individual may be educated out
of it  but this does not necessarily follow as proven with my dog in
berlin  2  as a general designation  then  i should consider asthenia as
apropos 

one objection to this is that the weakness is by this terminology lacking in
localization   our data above has shown us that the location of the trouble
is visual  that is  it is situated about a centre of sensory registration
that deposits data from the eye  this must naturally then be located
somewhere in or near the cuneus  we could therefore add to the terminology
this idea of a minute localization and call it a centre asthenia 

some may prefer to carry the matter one step farther and add the name of the
centre in which this weakness is located  but i fear if i take this step and
complete my terminology by the word  visual centre asthenia   it will  as
such  not cover quite all the cases  for i find that sometimes the
visualization is absent in other areas as well  and also the holding of an
emotion of pleasure or pain and of other dominating mental attitudes that
are sometimes visualized would not  therefore  be included  i would
therefore retract the broader claim in order to place the term on a
conservative basis and call the essence of the lesion simply no more or less
than a centre asthenia   as well as visual asthenia  the following terms
might be considered as applicable  collaborative centre asthenia 
imaginative centre asthenia  visual creative centre asthenia  picture
producing centre asthenia  we say neurasthenia when the trouble is not in
the nerves as such  so much as it is in the collaborative centres  more of
this later   here in stuttering the trouble is also collaborative  and we
can be still more definite than that and say the trouble is with the
collaboration of visualization  so if i were forced  however  to choose one
term from all these  my choice would be  visual centre asthenia    this
indicates a new and rational treatment   but of this later 

summary   psychoanalysis reveals stuttering as some vague trouble in the
personality 1   psychological analysis shows stuttering is an absent or weak
visualization at the time of speech  this new concept of stuttering as
faulty visualization may be called visual centre asthenia   this lack or
weakness in visualization accounts for all the numerous phenomena of
stuttering in severe  medium  or mild cases  a new treatment is indicated

there is a general impression that the explanations of natural phenomena 
including human destinies  to which the term superstitious is given are
usually attributable to the vestiges of traditional cosmogonies of our
tribal ancestors handed down to children at the knees of their parents or
guardians  this explanation however  is only true of a portion of the
beliefs which we call superstitions   the demand for superstitious
explanations depends upon psychophysiological tendencies of the human
organism  the root of which is comprised in the affect which we call
craving  this theorem i have tried to develop as follows   

i

craving is a sign of physiological need   it is a sensory phenomenon  of
which  however  explicit awareness cannot always be discovered  it is
conspicuously noticed in cases of disturbance of the body secretions  such
as occurs in over function of the thyroid gland  it is regarded as a crude
body consciousness that something is the matter   in motorial organisms it
causes visible reaction  this expresses itself in what is termed
restlessness  but the unrest may show itself by a fixation more particularly
in the muscles of emotional expression  although the manifestation is not
confined to these  shallow respirations and restricted amplitude of movement
in limbs and trunk may be observed also  in cerebrate animals the reaction
of the individual is under the guidance of preceding impressions stored in
the pallium and known as memories  whereas in the animals without a pallium
all reaction is accomplished through stable mechanisms known as instincts 
both of these types of reaction are tropisms merely  but the former are
labile  conditionable  whereas the latter cannot be modified  the science of
conditionable reactions of cerebrate animals is called psychology  and the
means by which the reactions are influenced are called psychogenetic 
whether these are healthy or diseased  it must not be forgotten  however 
that the genesis of a psychological disturbance may be purely somatic 
although the manner in which the reaction shows itself is contingent mainly
upon the features of the individual which have been derived from previous
sensory impressions and their resultant motor reactions commonly known as
experience  it is the influence of these upon the hereditary dispositions of
the individual which constitute what is known as  make up  or character  and
it is this which determines the form which reaction to stimulus must take 
whether the stimulus is purely psychological or somatic 

now physiological discomfort is an experience universal at one time of life
or another  but the reaction to it is infinite in variety  and while part of
it depends upon the congenital dispositions which are the common property of
humanity  a larger part is contingent upon the psychogenetic factors which
have stamped the individual 

ii

now an influence which has been of great significance to every human being
since the traditional period  at least  has been the concept of the universe
regnant at the period of that individual s life  the insistence by its
protagonists upon this concept as the ultimate motive of human endeavour
made its acceptance almost universal at periods when it was the custom to
lean upon the dicta of authority for guidance in life even when blind
obedience was not the rule  now in natural affairs  inconvenient
questionings and scepticisms towards dogmatisms would ultimately reach
truth   but as inaccessibleness to verification of what was called
supernatural made authority  rather than investigation  its criterion 
excommunication from the tribe would still all criticism  1  thus every act
of life became permeated by motives  originated in arbitrary interpretations
of a super nature 

 1  a dramatic study of this occurrence is presented by grant allen in  the
story of why why  in his book  the wrong paradise  

these influences were specially conspicuous concerning the difficulties of
man s almost blind struggle against the uncomprehended astronomical and
geodetic phenomena marvelled at and fled from  as well as the pestilences
which ravaged him  in his sociological affairs too  every act or thought
became embued with relationship to an extraneous power 

it is by these social and physical phenomena that the greatest appeal is
made to the states of feeling termed emotions and sentiments  so that it
became the custom to invoke  concerning ill states of feeling  the reference
to a supernatural influence   thus  from the cradle up  the ordering of
social relationships was made dependent upon the simple expedient of the
supernatural extraneous agent  rather than upon the more difficult and
elaborate analysis and synthesis which would have been required for a proper
investigation of each perturbing circumstance in its relation to life as a
whole  the power of this influence was inversely proportional to the
resiliency and tenacity as well as the general well being of the individual 

but not only is reference to the supernatural favoured by traditional
cosmogony  but because of certain psychological features of the individual
himself there is a tendency towards supernatural explanations of the
introspective observations  the occasions of introspection of this kind are
two  and i am not speaking of the inculcated introspection of the moralists 
one of these occasions is the self examination into his conduct which is a
normal character of a thinking being  this may give rise to supernatural
explanations even when the introspection is not determined by the tradition
of which i have already spoken 

the second kind of occasion demanding introspection  is the autochthonous
emanation of feeling of unaccustomed character  such feelings occur at the
physiological epochs   but at these times they are readily explained in a
familiar and simple way  and hence no supernatural agency is usually
invoked  a similar explanation is made readily enough in cases of evident
bodily disease  even where mental symptoms are prominent  for it is no
longer the custom to speak of demon possession even in the acute deliria 
but even where no physiological epoch or clearly defined physical disease
stands forth  unusual feelings are no uncommon phenomenon  and they demand
explanation  such occur conspicuously in the psychopathological syndrome so
completely described by janet under the term psychasthenia  persons thus
afflicted feeling an incapacity and an impediment to their free activity and
not recognizing that they are sick  endeavour to interpret their feelings 
of course  the interpretation varies somewhat in accordance with the nature
of the feelings  and with the person s information about the world and his
psyche  but quite apart from modifications of this type  i have found it
very common for patients to declare  i feel as if there was another person
in me   or  i feel compelled as if by another agency to act thus    the
explanation of a supernatural agent weighing upon them becomes very easy 
for the purpose of this discussion  it is not important whether
psychasthenia arises purely from degeneration of structure  or from faults
in the chemistry of the plasma which bathes the nerve structures  or whether
it is a purely psychopathological condition to which the physical phenomena
are secondary  as some would have us believe   our object is merely the
setting forth of the fact that it is a diseased condition which disposes its
victim towards metaphysical explanations 

it is a sort of uneasiness which prevents comfort in the feelings of
certainty  in the operations of the intellect and decision of action  the
patient finding himself abulic  and perhaps too critical minded to accept
the mundane supports in his vicinity  seeks a solace in that which to him
seems powerful because incomprehensible  that is to say in something
supernatural 

for this  it is not essential that the victim s mind be pervaded by the
infantine cosmogony which parades often as religious truth  without anything
of the sort  there may arise naive interpretations  hardly even having
explicit reference to supernatural agents  for example  a patient may say
 if i begin on friday  a certain undertaking will fail    if i do not turn
my vest twice  misfortune will occur    it is incumbent upon me to turn
round in my chair  or the negotiations will fail    the enumeration of
expedients would be useless  the above are from three different patients 
one a boy of fourteen now completely cured  the second from the son of a
prominent public man now quite restored to health  the third from a case
still under care  in none of these was the bodily state of importance  the
psychological reactions were the sole object of therapeutic effort  and
their ordination was accomplished by purely psychological means

the suggestions here put forward concerning personal  autopsychic  delusions
are based on material of the same sort as that previously analyzed for a
study of somatic and of environmental  allopsychic  delusions  our
conclusions are also influenced by two analyses of the types of delusion
found in general paresis   moreover  at a period subsequent to the analysis
presented here  some work on fifth decade insanities had been completed  and
the delusional features constantly found in the functional cases of insanity
developing at the climacteric  entered to modify our general point of view 

the situation may be summed up as follows 

the accessibility to analysis of the clinical and anatomical data at the
danvers state hospital was such as to prompt the use of its card catalogues
for statistical work upon delusions  the more so  because in a period of
enthusiasm over the wernickean trilogy  autopsyche  allopsyche 
somatopsyche  of conscious phenomena  the danvers catalogue had attempted to
divide the delusions recorded into the three wernickean groups  putting
these clinical data side by side with the anatomical data  we were speedily
able to single out those cases with normal or normal looking brains and thus
to secure a group approximately composed of functional cases of insanity 

it shortly developed  as to the content of delusions  that somatic delusions
were exceedingly prone to parallel the conditions found in the trunk viscera
and other non nervous tissues of the subjects at autopsy   a subsequent
study has confirmed this conclusion for the distressing hypochondriacal
delusions found in climacteric insanities  which delusions  however
distressing  are often far less so than the true conditions found at
autopsy  and it may be generally stated that the clinician can get very
valuable points concerning the somatic interiors of his patients by
reasoning back from the contents of their somatic delusions 

but how far can we  as psychiatrists  reason back from the contents of
environmental delusions  e  g  those of persecution  to the actual
conditions of a given patient s environment  in a few cases it seemed that
something like a close correlation did exist between such allopsychic
delusions and the conditions which had surrounded the patient  the delusory
fears of insane merchants ran on commercial ruin  and certain women dealt in
their delusions largely with domestic debacles  but on the whole  we could
not say that  as the somatic delusions seemed to grow out of and somewhat
fairly represent the conditions of the some  so the environmental delusions
would appear to grow out of or fairly represent the environment 

thus  however brilliant an idea was wernicke s in constructing the
allopsyche  or  as it were  social and environmental side of the mind  for
the purpose of classification  our own analysis promised to show that for
genetic purposes the allopsyche was much less valuable  these delusions
having a social content pointed far more often inwards at the personality of
the patient than outwards at the conditions of the world  and case after
case  having apparently an almost pure display of environmental delusions 
turned out to possess most obvious defects of intellect or of temperament
which would forbid their owners to react properly to the most favourable of
environments   hence  we believe  it may be generally stated that the
clinician is far less likely to get valuable points as to the social
exteriors of his patients from the contents of their social delusions than
he proved to be able to get when reasoning from somatic delusions to somatic
interiors  put briefly  the deluded patient is more apt to divine correctly
the diseases of his body than his devilments by society 

our statistical analysis  therefore  set us drifting toward disorder of
personality as the source of many delusions apparently derived ab extra and
tended to swell the group of autopsychic cases at the expense of the
allopsychic group 

in the statistical analysis of a group of cases corresponding roughly with
the so called functional group of diseases  we find false beliefs about the
some on a somewhat different plane from those about the patient s self and
his worldly fortunes  we can even discern through the ruins of the paretic s
reaction that his false beliefs concerning the body are often not so false
after all  and that his damaged brain of itself is not so apt to return
false ideas about his somatic interior as about his worldly importance and
plight   there then seems to be more reality about somatic than about
personal delusions  the contents of somatic delusions are rather more apt to
correspond with demonstrable realities than the contents of personal
delusions  accordingly our analysis of delusional contents includes a hint
also as to genesis   taken naively  the facts suggest a somatic genesis for
somatic delusions exactly in proportion as these delusions are not so much
false beliefs as partially true ones 

what genetic hint have we for the delusions concerning personality  one
genetic hint was obtained from a correlation of delusions with lesions in
general paresis  2  in which disease perhaps the most profound and
disastrous of all alterations of personality are found  amidst the other
alterations of personality found in paresis  autopsychic delusions are
characteristic   indeed allopsychic delusions are conspicuously few in our
series   and  as above  the somatic delusions  fewer in number  can be
fairly easily correlated with somatic lesions  or else with lesions of the
receptor apparatus  thalamus  of the brain 

now it was precisely the cases with autopsychic delusions  as well as with
profound disorder of personality in general  that showed the brunt of the
destructive paretic process in the frontal region  the other
not so autopsychic cases did not show this frontal brunt  but were less
markedly diseased at death and had a more diffuse process 

our genetic hint from paresis  therefore  inclines us to the conception that
this disorder of the believing process is more frontal than parietal  more
of the anterior association area than of the posterior association area of
the brain  and if we can trust our intuitions so far  the perverted
believing process is thus more a motor than a sensory process  more a
disorder of expression than a disorder of impression  more a perversion of
the will to believe than a matter of the rationality of a particular credo 

again we may appear to burst through from an undergrowth of statistics into
the clear field of truism   false beliefs are more practical than
theoretical  more a matter of practical conduct than of passive experience 
more a change of reagent than a reaction to change  the man on the street or
even many a leading neurologist would perhaps accept this formula as his
own 

certainly in general the least satisfactory of these chapters on the nature
of delusions was the chapter on environmental effects  3  and this perhaps
because the results seemed so nearly negative 

a further contribution to delusions of environmental nature was somewhat
unexpectedly derived from a piece of work on the general mental
symptomatology of general paresis  4  dichotomizing the paretics  all
autopsied cases  into a group with substantial  i  e   encephalitic 
atrophic or sclerotic lesions of the cortex and a group without such gross
lesions or else with merely a leptomeningitis  i found the latter  or
anatomically mild  group to be characterized by a set of symptoms which were
all  contra environmental   whereas the former  or anatomically severe  did
not thus run counter to the environment  the conclusions of that paper  so
far as they concern us now  are as follows   

the  mild  cases showed a group of symptoms which might be termed
contra environmental  viz   allopsychic delusions  sicchasia  refusal of
food   resistiveness  violence  destructiveness 

the  severe  cases showed a group of symptoms of a quite different order 
affecting personality either to a ruin of its mechanisms in confusion and
incoherence  or to mental quietus involved in euphoria  exaltation  or
expansiveness 

the most positive results of this orienting study appear to be the
unlikelihood of euphoria and allied symptoms in the  mild  or non atrophic
cases and the unlikelihood of certain symptoms  here termed
contra environmental  in the severe or atrophic cases  perhaps these
statistical facts may lay a foundation for a study of the pathogenesis of
these symptoms   meantime the pathogenesis of such symptoms as amnesia and
dementia cannot be said to be nearer a structural resolution  as these
symptoms appear to be approximately as common in the  mild  as in the
 severe  groups 

but in both papers dealing with paresis  2 4  we rest under the suspicion
that the delusions are possibly of cerebral manufacture  of course  a lesion
somewhere outside the brain is not unlikely to be projected through the
diseased brain  and somatic delusions in the paretic are rather likely to
represent something in the viscera 

it was desirable to get back to normal brain material  to learn how the
intrinsically normal brain 5  could perhaps produce delusions from a
particular environment  could a particularly  bad  environment actually
produce delusions 

by chance  at about this stage in our studies of delusions  some work on
fifth decade insanities 6  was completed  this work seemed to show that the
most characteristic  non coarsely organic  cases of involutional origin were
much given to delusions  each of 24 cases studied   somewhat more so than to
the hypochondria and melancholia which we commonly ascribe to the involution
period  but this result is equivocal as to the environmental  i  e 
allopsychogenic  power to produce delusions  since one could not rid oneself
of the suspicion that the delusions were due to the degenerating brain 

to return to our former results with the normal looking brain 

case after case of the quasi environmental group proved to be more
essentially personal than environmental  until at last it almost seemed that
the environment could seldom be blamed for any important share in the
process of false belief  in short  we seemed to show that environment is
seldom responsible for the delusions of the insane 

be that as it may  we secured several lines of attack on the delusions of
personality by our study of quasi environmental delusions  first  we were
irresistibly led to a consideration of the emotional  pleasant or
unpleasant  character of the delusions  we heaped up a large number of
unpleasant delusions in that  quasi environmental  but actually  personal
group  it is interesting to inquire  accordingly  whether our more obviously
autopsychic cases will also be possessed of an unpleasant tone  secondly  we
came upon the curious fact that cardiac and various subdiaphragmatic
diseases were correlated with unpleasant emotion as expressed in the
delusions   it was therefore important to inquire whether similar conditions
prevailed in the new group  thirdly  we found ourselves inquiring whether
our patients were victims of what might be termed a spreading inwards of the
delusions  egocentripetal  or a spreading outwards thereof  egocentrifugal
delusions   but this difference in trend  clear as it often is from the
patient s point of view  remains to be defined from the outsider s point of
view 

again  it remains to determine  if possible  how far delusions are dominated
respectively by the intellect or the emotions  or even by the volitions 

as before  i begin with a brief statistical analysis 

summary

danvers autopsy series  unselected cases 1000
cases with little or no gross brain disease 306
cases listed as having autopsychic delusions 106
cases listed as having only autopsychic delusions 50
cases for various reasons improperly classified 13
cases of general paresis in which gross brain lesions were not observed 15
residue of autopsychic cases 22

the group of 22 cases thus sifted out can be studied from many points of
view   we may recall that our former study of allopsychic delusions proved
that a large proportion of delusions concerning the environment were in all
probability not essentially derived from the environment  their contents
might relate to the environment  but their genesis could better be regarded
as autopsychic  intrapersonal   in fact we really found only 6 out of 58
cases of pure allopsychic delusions  which could be safely taken as showing
so much coincidence between anamnesis and delusions that a correlation could
be risked 

following the method of our former work on somatic and on environmental
delusions  we sought in the first instance pure cases of autopsychic
delusion information  for a variety of reasons  more than half of the
original list  namely  28 cases  had to be excluded   many of these
exclusions were due to the strong suspicion that the cases were really cases
of general paresis  despite the normality of the brains in the gross  the
residue of 22 cases include  we are confident  no instance of exudative
disease of the syphilitic group  though general syphilization cannot safely
be ruled out in all cases 

there are two groups of cases  a group of eleven cases with delusions of a
generally pleasant or not unpleasant character  in which group there is a
small sub group of three cases of octogenarians with expansive delusions
reminding one of those of general paresis  and a group of eleven cases with
delusions of an unpleasant character 

i  cases having delusions of a nature pleasing or not unpleasing to the
believer

the true emotional nature of the beliefs placed in this group cannot fairly
be stated to be pleasurable   but  if not pleasurable  they may perhaps be
stated to be complacent  expansive  or of air castle type  the criteria of
their choice have been largely negative   the patients are not recorded as
expressing beliefs of a painful or displeasing character  in the absence of
which we may suppose the beliefs to be either indifferent or actually
pleasing in character 

of the 11 cases whose delusions were supposedly of an agreeable nature or at
least predominantly not unpleasant  there were 3 with delusions reminding
one of general paresis  the ages of these three were 80  84  and 87
respectively  they did not show any pathognomonic sign  e g  plasma cells 
of general paresis   they all showed in common very marked lesions of the
cortex  including the frontal regions  in two instances the extent of the
frontal lesions was presaged by focal overlying pial changes   999 was a
case of pseudoleukemia with marked cortical devastation but without brain
foci of lymphoid cells  two of the cases showed cell losses more marked in
suprastellate layers  in the third there was universal nerve cell
destruction  with active satellitosis caught in process 

condensed notes concerning the cases with pseudoparetic delusions follow 
two of them  it will be noticed  yielded some delusions also of an
unpleasant nature 

case i   d  s  h  10940  path  999  was a clever business man  civil war
veteran  who began to lose ground at 75 and died at 84  he was given during
his disease to boasting and perpetual writing about elaborate real estate
schemes and said he owned a  100 000 concern for the purpose 

the case was clinically unusual in that the picture of a pseudoleukemia was
presented  with demonstration at autopsy of great hyperplasia of
retroperitoneal lymph nodes and grossly visible islands of lymphoid
hyperplasia in liver and spleen  the brain weighed 1390 grams and showed
little or no gross lesion  if we except a pigmentation of the right
prefrontal region under an area of old pias hemorrhage  there was also a
chronic leptomeningitis  with numerous streaks and flecks along the sulci 
especially in the frontal region  there was little or no sclerosis visible
in the secondary arterial branches and but few patches in the larger
arteries  microscopically the cortex proved to be far from normal  every
area examined showed cell loss  perhaps more markedly in the suprastellate
layers than below 

case 2    d  s  h  11980  path  1024  was a civil war veteran who failed in
the grocery business  was alcoholic  was finally reduced to keeping a
boarding house and grew gradually queer  mental symptoms of a pronounced
character are said to have begun at 75  death at 80   delusions reminded one
of general paresis  worth  5 000 000 a month  108 years old  was to build a
church  also  a woman was trying to poison him 

autopsy showed caseous nodules in lung  coronary and generalized
arteriosclerosis  including moderate basal cerebral   mitral and aortic
stenosis  the aortic valve also calcified   the frontal pia mater was
greatly thickened and  although no gross lesions were noted in the cortex 
the microscope brings out marked lesions in the shape of cell losses
 especially in suprastellate layers  in all areas examined  there were no
plasma cells in any area examined 

case 3    d  s  h  12767  path  1185  was a widowed irish woman  who died at
87   previous history blank   extravagant delusions of wealth were
associated with a fear of being killed 

the autopsy showed little save chronic myocarditis with brown atrophy 
calcification of part of thyroid  non united fracture of neck of left femur 
moderate coronary arteriosclerosis   the brain was abnormally soft  some of
the larger intracortical vessels showed plugs of leucocytes possibly
indicating an early encephalitis  bacillus cold and a gram staining bacillus
were cultivated from the cerebrospinal fluid   though the convolutions were
neither flattened nor atrophied and absolutely no lesion was grossly
visible  the cortex cerebri and also the cerebellum were found undergoing an
active satellitosis with nerve cell destruction in all areas examined 

the following three cases  iv  v  vi  present a certain identity from their
delusions concerning messages from god  v thought he was god   it is very
doubtful whether vi should be placed in the present group of pleasant or not
unpleasant delusions  since the patient appears to have been  theomaniacal 
as the french say  in a rather passive and unpleasant manner  god occasioned
foolish actions   placed on general statistical grounds at first in the not
unpleasant group  case vi should be transferred to the unpleasant group 
case v s delusion  identification with god  expression of atonement   was in
any event episodic in a septicemia   case iv   happiest woman in the
world    was phthisical  cf  vii  notes follow 

case 4    d  s  h  4019  path  218  housewife  37 years always cheerful 
became the happiest woman in the world  hearing god s voice and being
specially under god s direction    acute mania   death from bilateral
phthisis with numerous cavities and bilateral pleuritis   there were no
other lesions except a small sacral bed sore  a small fibromyoma of the
uterine fundus  small slightly cystic ovaries  a slight dural thickening 
and possibly a slight general cerebral atrophy    wt  app  1205 grams 
marked emaciation  

case v   d  s  h  11742  path  852  was a victim of streptococcus septicemia
 three weeks  who said he was god   patient was a protestant iron worker of
59 years  who had lost an eye and had become unable to work about three
months before death   aortic  cardiac  renal lesions at autopsy  prostatic
hypertrophy   dr  a  m  barrett found few changes in nerve cells  except
fever changes   one area in left superior frontal gyrus showed superficial
gliosis 

case vi    d  s  h  5345  path  867  was a  primary delusional insanity   a
salesman of 37 years  whose beliefs concerned impressions direct from god 
in consequence of which he habitually knelt and prayed  yet many of the
actions which he felt he must perform were foolish actions   the patient
died of pneumococcus septicemia during a lobar pneumonia   the brain showed
a few changes suggestive of fever  a  m  barrett   there were a few flecks
of atheroma in the aorta  there was an acute parenchymatous nephritis with
focal plasma cell infiltrations suggesting acute interstitial nephritis 
this case appears to have shown one of the most nearly normal brains in the
whole danvers series 

the remainder of the pleasant or not unpleasant group as originally
constituted consists of vii  a phthisical case  cf  iv   viii  probably
feeble minded romancer  not deluded in the sense of self deception  probably
best excluded from present consideration   ix  probably not safely to be
assigned to the pleasant or not unpleasant group  feeling passive in
somewhat the same sense as case vi  see above   suffering from auditory
hallucinosis  superior temporal atellitosis  data of the late w  l 
worcester   x  delusion of birth to superior station  possibly the object of
mixed emotions  probably not pleasant  and xi  manic depressive exaltation
with grandiose utterances  long prior to death  if there had been lung
tuberculosis at the basis of the ileac ulcers  it had long since healed  

notes follow  vii xi  and at the end a brief summary of the entire group
 i xi  

case 7    d  s  h  8878  path  521  it is questionable whether the delusions
classified in this case entitle it to inclusion in the present study  e g 
 i was baptized in the catholic church  patient a protestant housewife  with
holy water  ink  and florida water    patient was variously designated  as
 dementia  and as  acute confusional insanity   death in second attack at 26
 first attack at 22   father also insane  death due to bilateral ptthisis
with tuberculosis of intestines and mesenteric glands  emaciation   it is
noteworthy that the brain weighed but 1038 grams   dr  w  l  worcester s
microscopic examination showed acute nerve cell changes probably of the type
of axonal reactions 

case 8  d  s  h  8807  path  556  very probably a feeble minded subject  at
all events patient had done no work in his life  had been given to spells of
restlessness and excitement  and had talked disconnectedly  symptoms were
thought to have dated from the tenth year  it is questionable whether a
statement that he was managing the electric railway and shipbuilding company
can be regarded as delusional  that is  as believed by the patient   death
was due to  perhaps septicemia from one abscess of jaw and to hypostatic
penumonia   the brain appeared normal but dr  w  l  worcester found  besides
certain acute changes  also satellitosis   the question remains open whether
the case should be regarded as defective or as belonging to the dementia
praecox group 

case 9    d  s  h  8605  path  568  had an ill defined attack of mental
disease and was in d  s  h  at 29   thereafter  lived in gloucester
almshouse  but at 51 became excited and was returned to d  s  h  where she
died at 59   possibly hallucinated  someone called her mother  single
woman   delusion  the spirit is here  protestant   patient was given to a
stream of muttered  vulgar and incoherent talk   possibly the case was
residual from hebephrenia   dr  w  l  worcester found cell changes in the
superior temporal gyri  finely granular stainable substance in practically
all nerve cells  and not elsewhere  the correlation is suggestive with the
probably auditory hallucinosis  the brain weighed 1190 grams   death due to
bronchopneumonia  heart and kidneys normal 

case 10    d  s  h  10145  path  928  a danish fisherman possibly
manic depressive  victim of three attacks at 40  50  and 69 years  the first
attack followed loss of wife  and delusions concerning being born again
developed   the last attack showed few well defined delusions  as patient
was in a bewildered and incoherent state  one statement is characteristic 
if patient had remained in denmark  he might have inherited the throne   the
autopsy showed most extensive arteriosclerosis  including basal cerebral 
death from general anasarca and jaundice   cholelithiasis   there was some
question of an acute encephalitic lesion in the tissues lining the posterior
half of the third ventricle   various chronic lesions  splenitis 
endocarditis  diffuse nephritis   malnutrition 

case 11    d  s  h  7767  path  792  was a case possibly of manic depressive
type  previous attacks hartford retreat and danvers state hospital  who
worked as machinist between attacks and died at 70  having been in d  s  h 
8 years  patient was greatly emaciated and anemic from chronic ulcers of
ileum  there was also cholelithiasis   there was a mild coronary atheroma
and slight mitral valve edge thickening 

the delusions expressed were those of great wealth  patient also thought he
was a great poet   no brain changes were found  a  m  barrett  

having attempted on the basis of certain statistical tags to constitute a
group of cases having relatively normal brains and pleasant  or not
unpleasant  delusions  we are forced to reconstruct our group upon viewing
several cases more attentively 

case viii should be excluded as probably not delusional 

case x might perhaps be transferred with propriety to the
unpleasant delusion group 

certain cases of felt passivity under divine influence separate themselves
out from the group  indeed vi and ix probably belong in the
unpleasant delusion group  see below  

these subtractions leave seven cases to deal with  three of these seven 
viz  i  ii and iii  are apparently best regarded as examples of frontal lobe
atrophy  and their grandiosity may resemble that of certain cases of general
paresis 

of the remaining four  two  cases iv and vii  are phthisical  one  case vi 
showed an episodic identification with god  incident in fatal septicemia  
and one  case xi  uttered manic depressive exalted statements about wealth
and poetical power 

i turn to a consideration of the unpleasant delusion group  which as first
constituted was to contain eleven cases  xii xxii  but to which must be
added three more  vi  ix  x  

case xii should be at once excluded from present consideration on account of
its microscopy 

case 12    d  s  h  12282  path  942  died in a second attack of depression
 manic depressive insanity    catholic  always of a quiet and reserved
disposition  happy in married life  delusional attitude concerning an

upon reviewing the unpleasant delusion group  then  we exclude one  xii 
altogether   it is questionable whether xv actually exhibited delusions at
all   we then discover that eight  in all probability all  of our nine
remaining cases are renal in the sense of grossly evident lesions at
autopsy 

but it will be remembered that we transferred three cases originally thought
to entertain  not unpleasant  delusions to the unpleasant group  because
their constraint  although conceived to be of divine origin  seemed to be
unpleasant  vi  ix  x   of these vi and x were renal cases  but ix is
expressly stated by a reliable observer  the late dr  w  l  worcester  to
have had normal kidneys as well as heart  in point of fact  however  case iv
had hallucinations and religious delusions   spirit is here   probably
derived therefrom  and dr  worcester found an isolated brain lesion
correlatable with the hallucinosis  and in any event the emotional state of
the patient is in grave doubt 

accordingly if we take the unpleasant delusion group to be constituted of
cases vi and x  transfers from the first group   xiii  xiv  and xiv to xxii 
that is eleven cases  we come upon the striking fact that virtually all of
them are renal cases 

of course  as  with canavan  i have been at some expense of time to prove 
virtually all cases of psychosis  as autopsied  are in a microscopic sense
abnormal as to kidneys  7  but only about a third exhibit gross interstitial
nephritis  arguing a certain severity of process  the above cases  it will
be observed  fall into the gross class in respect to renal lesions 

without laying too much stress on such results  it is worth while to say
that  whereas most workers might be willing to surmise that metabolic or
catabolic disorder must affect the sense of well being  i must confess that
the discovery of so much gross kidney disease in a group selected on other
grounds filled me with a certain surprise 

the literature is not without suggestions as to the possible correlation of
renal and mental disorder   ziehen  8  for example  remarks that nephritis
brings about mental disease in two ways   through vascular changes which
very frequently accompany chronic nephritis and other uremic changes in the
blood  inasmuch as we know that creatin  creatinin and potassium salts
irritate the animal cortex  ziehen notes that psychopathic phenomena may
occur in man as a result of slight uremic changes  according to ziehen  most
of these nephritic psychoses run the course of what he calls hallucinatory
paranoia  it may be remembered that ziehen counts among paranoias a number
of acute diseases and even so called meynert s amentia   chronic nephritis 
as well as acute diabetes and addison s disease are thought by ziehen to
produce certain chronic forms of mental defect which he terms autotoxic
dementia  but he regards most of these cases as really cases of
arteriosclerotic dementia 

it does not appear that wernicke 9  has considered renal correlations
systematically 

kraepelin 10  mentions the epileptiform convulsions of uremia as well as
delirious and comatose conditions  especially those in advanced pregnancy 
these uremic conditions may be both acute and chronic   but kraepelin has
not been able to convince himself of the existence of a clearly defined
uremic insanity unless the delirious condition just mentioned may be
regarded as such

binswanger 11  states that the mental disorders occurring in acute and
chronic nephritis are either toxemic psychoses on uremic bases  or due to
arteriosclerosis   in the latter cases  he states that the disease pictures
are as a rule characterized by grave disturbances of emotions  chiefly of a
depressive character  he adds that these are all too frequently the
forerunners of arteriosclerotic brain degeneration 

a brief mention of renal disease in the general etiology of mental disease
is made by ballet  12  ballet states that griesinger s opinion that renal
disease had little importance in the etiology of mental disease and that no
one would count the cerebral symptoms of bright s disease as mental is no
longer held  ballet enumerates a number of works upon so called folie
brightique which tend to prove that acute or chronic bright s disease gives
rise either to melancholic disorder or alternately to maniacal and
melancholic disorder  how the mental disease is produced is doubtful 
ballet holds that all the various psychopathic disorders resulting from
bright s disease are autotoxic  renal disease like heart disease is only
capable of awakening a latent predisposition or liberating a constitutional
psychosis  unless it is merely effecting a species of intoxication 

it cannot be doubted that the relation of kidney disorder to mental disorder
is worth intensive study  of which the present communication is merely a
fragment   progress will be of course impeded by the fact that upon
microscopic examination  practically all cases of mental disease coming to
autopsy show renal disease of one or other degree  in fact  it is perhaps
possible to show a higher correlation of renal disease with mental disease
than of brain disease to mental disease  perhaps something can be obtained
if we limit ourselves to a study of cases with pronounced somatic renal
symptoms and signs  cases with the renal facies and the like 

as to the question of phthisis and mental disease  ziehen remarks that the
tuberculous are often observed to be optimistic but that other cases show a
hypochondriacal depression with egocentric narrowing of interests   he
speaks of a sort of rudimentary delusional disorder looking in the direction
of jealousy in certain cases  pronounced mental disorder occurs rarely in
tuberculosis  according to ziehen  and leads either to melancholia or to
hallucinatory states of excitement  resembling the deliria of exhaustion or
inanition  acute miliary tuberculosis may produce the impression of a
general paresis or of an amentia in meynert s sense   the inanition delirium
of tuberculosis resembles that of carcinosis and malaria 

kraepelin regards tuberculosis as of very slight significance in the
causation of insanity  despite the fact that slight changes in mood and in
voluntary actions frequently accompany the course of the disease 
irritability  depression and sensitiveness  incomprehensible confidence and
desire to undertake various tasks  pronounced selfishness  sexual excitement
and jealousy are the traits of mental disorder in tuberculosis 

kraepelin states that many cases of tuberculosis show traits of alcoholic
disease and says that the occurrence of polyneuritic forms of alcoholic
mental disorder is favored by the association of tuberculosis with
alcoholism 

wernicke does not systematically consider the topic 

binswanger states that tuberculosis  aside from miliary tuberculosis or
meningitis  produces no mental disorder except phenomena of the amentia of
exhaustion 

ballet states that there exists a peculiar mental state in the tuberculous 
it is compounded as rule of sadness  of looking on the dark side and of
profound egoism   this readily leads to mistrust and suspicion which may be
pronounced enough to constitute a sort of persecutory delusional state or a
state of melancholic depression  clouston  ball   more rarely there are
phenomena of excitation explained in part by fever  in its slightest degree
this phenomenon of excitation is characterized by a feeling of well being 
of euphoria  which even at the point of death may give the patient the
illusion of a return to health  or there may be a more pronounced excitation
with impulsive sexual and alcoholic tendencies  autointoxication may lead to
the usual train of confusional symptoms 

if we compare the accounts in the literature of the two conditions here in
question  namely  nephritis and phthisis  we must be convinced  that aside
from so called autotoxic phenomena  renal disorder seems to be marked by a
tendency to depressive emotions but that phthisis shows not only depressive
emotion but also euphoric and hyperkinetic phenomena 

so far as these results thus hastily reviewed are concerned  they are
consistent with the appearances in the present group of cases  both the
nephritic and phthisical groups need further intensive study 

as to the question of the spreading inwards or outwards of delusions from
the standpoint of the patient  no analysis is here attempted  it is plain 
however  that the theopaths  as james calls them  or victims of theomania 
to use the french phrase  will be of importance in this analysis because of
the equivocal character of the emotions felt in cases of religious delusion 

summary and conclusions

the paper deals with delusions of a personal  autopsychic  nature and is one
of a series based upon certain statistics of danvers state hospital cases
 previous work published on somatic  environmental  allopsychic  delusions
and those characteristic of general paresis   the previous work had
suggested that somatic delusions are perhaps more of the nature of illusions
in the sense that somatic bases for somatic false beliefs are as a rule
found   on the other hand  delusions respecting the environment  allopsychic
delusions  had appeared to be more related to essential disorder of
personality than to actual environmental factors 

the fact that cases of paresis with delusions were found to have their
lesions in the frontal lobe  whereas non delusional cases showed no such
marked lesions  is of interest in the light of the present paper because
three cases of senile psychosis were found to have delusions of grandeur
and  although they are demonstrably not paretic  they also show mild frontal
lobe changes supported by microscopic study 

the danvers autopsied series  containing 1000 unselected cases  was found to
show 306 instances with little or no gross brain disease  of these  106 had
autopsychic delusions and of these 106  50 cases had delusions of no other
sort   15 of these 50 cases appeared to have been cases of general paresis
in which gross brain lesions were not observed at autopsy  and upon
investigation 13 other cases were found to be  for various reasons 
improperly classified  the residue of 22 cases was subject to analysis and
readily divides itself into two groups of 11 cases each  or two groups of
normal looking brain cases having autopsychic delusions and these only are
cases which may be termed the  pleasant  and  unpleasant  groups  in the
sense that the delusions in the first group were either pleasant or not
unpleasant  whereas the delusions in the second group were of clearly
unpleasant character 

three of the  pleasant  delusion group were the three cases of grandeur and
delusions in the senium above mentioned  three others were cases of
 theomania  in the sense that their delusions concerned messages from god 
it is not clear that these three religious cases should be regarded as
belonging in the group of  pleasant  delusions on account of the sense of
constraint felt by the patients 

the remainder of the  pleasant group   as the delusions were originally
defined  turned out for the most part to show either doubtful delusions or
delusions involving a sense of constraint rather than of pleasure 

an endeavor was made to learn the relations of pulmonary phthisis to the
emotional tone of the delusions   the few available cases in this series
seem consistent with the hypothesis of phthisical euphoria  iv   happiest
woman in the world   hearing god s voice  vii and possibly xi  

the problems of the  pleasant  delusion group  as superficially defined 
turned out to be a   the problem of a group of senile psychoses with
grandiose delusions and frontal lobe atrophy  b   the problem of felt
passivity under divine influence  c   the problem of phthisical euphoria 

the group of  unpleasant  delusions in the normal looking brain group should
be diminished by one on account of its positive microscopy  encephalitis  
one case  xiii  is a case of mixed emotions of religious type  showing
phthisis pulmonalis together with abdominal tuberculosis and nephritis   one
case  xv  is doubtful as to delusions  the remainder are subject to renal
disease  as a rule associated with cardiac lesions 

two cases which were transferred from the  pleasant  to the  unpleasant 
group on account of constraint feelings  were also renal cases   vii and ix 
the only exception to the universality of renal lesions in this group is the
case in which religious delusions were probably based upon hallucinations
for which hallucinations an isolated brain lesion was found  very probably
correlatable with the hallucinosis 

virtually all of the eleven cases determined to belong in the  unpleasant 
group are cases with severe renal disease as studied at autopsy 

whether the unpleasant emotional tone in these cases of delusion formation
is in any sense nephrogenic and whether particular types of renal disease
have to do with the unpleasant emotion  must remain doubtful   a still more
doubtful claim may be made concerning the relation of euphoria to phthisis 
the renal correlation is much more striking as well as statistically better
based  a further communication will attack the problem from the side of the
kidneys in a larger series of cases

discussion

dr  morton prince  boston   i sympathize with dr  putnam in his interest in
philosophical problems  my only conflict with his point of view being with
what i conceive to be a mixing of problems   i suppose that if we want an
explanation of the universe it must be in terms of philosophy or
metaphysics  the only alternative is to accept it as a phenomenal universe 
as it is  you will remember that when it was reported to carlisle that
margaret fuller said she  accepted the universe   he replied  gad   i think
she had better    so we have got either to explain the universe in terms of
philosophy or accept it as it is 

i have no objection to introducing philosophical problems if we do not
confuse those problems with our psychological problems  they are entirely
distinct   this distinction between philosophy and science the physicists
and chemists clearly recognize  one of their problems is the ultimate nature
of matter  but it is not a problem of practical physics and chemistry  these
deal  let us say  with phenomenal atoms and molecules  with their
attractions and repulsions  etc   in dealing with the problem of the
ultimate nature of matter the chemist analyzes matter and finds that it can
be reduced to atoms  and then analyzes the atoms and finds them composed of
electrons flying about within the circumscribed space of an atom  then he
analyzes the electron and reduces it to negative electricity  and when asked
what negative electricity is he says it is a form of the energy of the
universe  and stops there and says   i don t know   when asked to explain
energy 

here the problem of the ultimate nature of matter becomes a question of
philosophy and metaphysics   it is a field of research by itself   the
chemist never confuses that problem with the specific problems of his
particular science  these deal with empirical atoms and molecules as he
finds them  no chemist would undertake to give the chemical formula of the
union of sulphuric acid and zinc by a formula which expressed the ultimate
nature of atoms or negative electricity  if he did so he would confuse his
problems   and so i think we confuse our problems when we attempt to explain
empirical psychological phenomena in philosophical or ultimate terms  we
must treat our psychological elements  ideas  wishes  emotions  etc   as the
chemist treats atoms and molecules  but  just as the latter may take up
ultimate problems as a special field of investigation so may we do  if we
like  but we must not treat them as psychological problems 

this confusion of problems is  i think  the fundamental error of jung and
others in treating of the libido when he and they attempt to explain
specific phenomena as empirically observed  jung undertakes to resolve
libido into the energy of the universe  of course this is possible   all
forces can be ultimately so resolved  including the forces of mind and body 
emotions such as anger and fear are forces and each of these forces  with
great probability  can be reduced in the ultimate analysis to a form of
energy  but this is not to admit that we are justified in explaining
specific concrete psychological phenomena  with which we are dealing  in
philosophical terms   we must explain them in terms of the phenomena
themselves   as a monist and pan psychist  for example  i may believe that
conscious processes can be reduced to  or be identified with the ultimate
nature of matter  the thing in itself  and conversely atoms and electrons
may be reduced to a force which may be identified with psychic force  but i
would not attempt to explain psychological behaviour in terms of such a
philosophical concept but only through phenomenal psychological forces  let
us say  wishes  in other words  i would not undertake to introduce
pan psychism into the problem at all as an explanation of a particular
phobia  i think  therefore  that when jung and others attempt to explain
phobias and other psychological phenomena through a philosophical concept of
the libido as analyzed into an elan vitale or the energy of the universe 
they not only confuse their problems but introduce such a mixing up of terms
that the resulting explanation becomes little more than nonsense   the
libido  whatever it may be  must be treated as a psychophysiological force
just like any of the other emotions  otherwise psychology ceases to be a
science 

now one word about conflicts   undoubtedly conflicts play a most important
part in such psychological disturbances as we have to deal with in the
psycho neuroses  but i cannot agree that psychological conflicts conform
only to  or are synonymous with ethical conflicts   undoubtedly there are a
large number of conflicts between ideas and sentiments which we have all
agreed to label as ethical  but there are also a large number of conflicts
between sentiments which cannot be pigeon holed as ethical  for example  the
mother whose child is threatened with danger and who herself would incur
danger in rescuing her child  undergoes a conflict between her fear
instinct  on the one hand  and her love on the other  exciting also her
anger emotion  the anger and love conflict with the fear  down and repress
it  there you have a conflict but i think it could not be classed as an
ethical conflict   it is a general law  whenever one instinct antagonizes
another instinct there is a conflict  it is a conflict which has its
prototype in the lower organic processes  thus sherrington s spinal
reflexes  that he has worked out so beautifully  involve conflicts between
opposing organic impulses  in the scratch reflex  for instance  the impulse
which excites the flexor muscles inhibits the excitation of the extensor
muscles  i believe this principle underlies the higher processes and upon it
is built up the whole of the psycho physiological mechanisms 

dr  tom a  williams  washington  d  c   i want dr  putnam to reply to two
objections to his position   one  the manifestations of functional
capacities which are themselves dependent upon structural differences  i am
not talking now of psychogenetic determinants  but alone of the trends of
which dr  putnam has spoken   is he not assuming the contrary to darwin when
he says that function precedes structure  are not the potentials dependent
upon the variation which has determined this function   i am speaking now in
the broadest possible terms and not confining myself to the cerebrum  do we
not find it in the tadpole who is prepared for breathing not because he
wants to breathe  but because he is going to have a new kind of breathing
apparatus and the duck who takes to the water because he has the mechanism
to swim 

two  in regard to hegel and the appeal to the ethical as being of a
different type from the motive of biological satisfaction  is not that
difficulty only apparent  and is it not answered by dr  putnam s own appeal
that these matters should be settled independently  and is not it the case
that the average sexual man would settle it very differently from dr  putnam
himself and most of us  and is not it true that  though the ethical
determinants of behaviour are not auspicious for the average sexual
satisfactions of man  yet are they not themselves forms of hedonistic
satisfactions  for a man who would behave unethically would be miserable in
doing so by the loss of his own self respect  so that he already has a
hedonistic determinant for his own conduct which is in harmony with the
biological concepts of aristotle 

dr  james j  putnam  boston   i should be very sorry to be taken as wishing
to put myself in the sort of adverse position which dr  prince and dr 
williams believe me to assume  i accept  of course  the proposition that
there are conflicts which are not ethical  and  as dr  williams says  the
average man would naturally come to different conclusions from those of the
trained man in ethical matters  i want to make a slight movement towards
restoring a balance which it seemed to me had become tipped too far one way 
psychoanalysts  for example  actually deal with metaphysics and yet they do
not really study out what this involves  if we were nothing but scientific
men we could say   very well  let metaphysics go    but we are not   we are
dealing with individuals who are thrilling with desires  hopes and fears 
the movements of which cannot be expressed in scientific formulae  dr 
williams speaks of darwin   it can be asserted with justice  however  that
the genetic method of investigation which is exemplified by darwin s study
of evolution is an imperfect method for discovering the aims of human
beings  i refer to the interesting book of prince kropotkin in which he
studies mutual aid as a factor in evolution  mutual aid being something not
adequately contemplated by darwin  who considers conflict as the essential
influence in evolution  prof  judd showed in a paper a few years ago the
change which has taken place in the attitude of a good many students of
economics through the introduction of human intelligence and desires as
something quite distinct from the conflicts of interests  and similar
arguments have been brought forward by students of evolution   among others
prof  cope  the distinguished zoologist of philadelphia and prof  hyatt of
boston  showed very clearly how the course of evolution becomes materially
changed when desires and will become prominent as factors  i agree that  as
a partial motive  structure does limit and determine function   there is no
question about that  i merely want to say that logically function precedes
structure  inasmuch as the wish and desire to do a thing precedes the means
by which we secure for ourselves the power to do it  but of course all
energies must work through structural media  in regard to hedonism  one must
recognize that pleasure counts as a partial motive  but when it comes to
taking it as the final motive it fails utterly   our lives contain
determinants which we cannot range under the category of pleasure  we act in
certain ways because our structure and our functions and our wills are what
they are  and not exclusively by our temporary wishes   our  meanings   when
thoroughly studied are found to coincide with the meaning of the universe as
a whole  it is only through getting hold of the entire scheme that you have
something that you can use as a criteria  the nearest approach to this is
obtained through the study of the most broadly developed  public spirited
men  and such men do not work in accordance with hedonistic principles

discussion

dr  john t  mac curdy  new york city   i have been so interested in the
paper by dr  hall that i have been distinctly delighted by it and with your
permission i will refer to a point in dr  putnam s paper directly pertinent
to the issues raised by dr  hall   dr  putnam has spoken of the necessity
for metaphysics by which i presume he means the necessity for formulation 
yesterday there was some antagonism in a discussion on formulation  we
cannot avoid formulating   our advance in knowledge is purely empiric unless
it is directly dependent on formulation  we have not formulated enough   we
have stuck too much to our empiric data  have not made the necessary
deductions from it  what formulations there are have been based on
therapeutic data and explain the productions of symptoms   no attention has
been paid to the general psychoneurotic or psychotic anlage   when this is
done i am sure that it will be found that there are just such primordial
reactions as president hall has been talking about lying back of all the
sexual impulses   sexual reactions have in the course of development come to
be the vehicle for more primitive ones  we know by observation that the
infant demonstrates anger in a much greater degree  and long before he gives
evidence of things sexual  in anything approaching the adult sense of that
term  the temporary formulation of psychoanalysts who attempt to explain
anger or temper by sadism are really ridiculous  president hall rightly says
that sadism must be explained by anger  that is one of the primitive
emotions   sex is merely a vehicle  the importance of this transference is
that the sex emotions are peculiarly adapted to repression and when once
unconscious  continue to operate all through the life of the individual 
this is less likely to occur in the sudden reaction of anger  which is much
more apt to be blown off at the time 

dr  smith ely jelliffe  new york  n  y   i cannot quote the line  but in
shaw s  doctor s dilemma   recently presented in new york  there is an
exchange of words during which the heroine tells the surgeon that she is
tempted to pass from loving him to hating him  he replied that one is
surprised after all what an amazing little difference there is between the
two different attitudes of mind  dr  jelliffe said he was quite in sympathy
with what dr  maccurdy had been saying  with reference to the need for
formulation  we all know how these formulations have grown and how they are
utilized practically   for instance  we formulate an attitude towards space 
we wish to handle space and say 3 ft  or 7 ft  in order to handle space
relations   in other words  to handle space we utilize a formulation which
we call a measure of space  in the same manner in order to handle time we
make a hypothetical unit to be pragmatic   in handling the phenomena of
electricity  we formulate other units   in my own mind there has grown up
therefore the analogy that in order to handle psychological phenomena we
have formulated the oedipus by hypothesis  this hypothesis i would define as
the unconscious biological directing of the energy of the child towards the
parent of the opposite sex and away from that of the same sex  this is the
unconscious basis of what in consciousness we call love and hate   the boy
is unconsciously directed away from the parent of the same sex   he develops
according to the oedipus hypothesis the desire to get away from the father
or the father image  all other men are patterned after the father image and
if this strong biological direction fails to take place  his interest not
being directed in an opposite direction  he fails to mate and thus fails in
his reproductive function   the reproductive function cannot go on without
this biological thrust towards the proper object  by narcissism is meant the
formulation that a new development is taking place in the infantile oedipus
fantasy   the child cannot hold on to the mother image   he passes it to
others nearer his own age  he does it first through his own identification
with the female  his bisexuality permits this   similarly the infantile
father protest must be supplanted by an evolved brotherly love  the
competition with the father image must take a new form  it must be a mutual
competition with mutual productivity  any contact between man and man that
does not ensue to the value of both in some degree  therefore  registers a
failure to sublimate the unconscious gather hatred of the infantile stage of
development  sublimated hatred of the father image is brotherly love 
sublimated love of the mother image is taking one s place in the world as a
father for the continuance of the race  in the unconscious the formula of
direction against same sex and towards opposite sex  means therefore that in
the unconscious love and hate are the same  one cannot give them these names
however 

thus i would enlarge the oedipus formula and say that it is useful not only
in understanding the neurotic  but it can be used to measure up all
psychological situations 

dr  james j  putnam  boston   i deeply appreciated and enjoyed what dr  hall
said and i have no question whatever that we all who are so interested in
psychological work profit by arguments of this sort being brought before our
notice   i think it is an unfortunate thing that adler  who was on that line
and did such good work in it  coupled his statements with a sort of
denunciation of freud s views  it seems to me to have been entirely
unnecessary   one of the remarkable stories of o  henry  who was a keen
observer of human nature  deals with a frontier army officer who exposed
continually himself to danger  desiring to work out in an indirect way this
feeling of conquering one person by another  only it was himself  his own
cowardice  that he wished eventually to conquer   i would ask dr  hall if
the notion of which royce has made so much  namely  the social concept  is
not one which perhaps would act as the common denominator in these cases  we
cannot assert ourselves and get angry without virtually having reference to
other persons  neither can we have sex feelings without such reference  it
seems that the social instinct or imagination which is carried around by
every individual and which determines his acts is as natural and as
invariably present as the existence of a desire to live  not to speak of the
desire to conquer 

dr  morton prince  boston   i feel extremely thankful to dr  hall for his
very interesting and satisfying presentation of the thesis which he has
given us   i remember an old gentleman once saying to me  in speaking of
another man with whom he had been conversing   he is a very intelligent man 
he thinks just as i do   so i think dr  hall is a very intelligent man  he
thinks just as i do  i am entirely in accord with his views which he has so
well expressed  what he has said is in principle the basis of the paper
which i intended to present this morning but which  in view of the length of
our programme  i have decided to withdraw 

the principle underlying the large number of concrete facts which he has
given is that besides the sexual instinct there are a large number of other
instincts  one of which is anger  which have a very important place and play
important parts in personality   some of these instincts play not only as
important a part as the sexual instinct but even a more important part 
and  as dr  hall has said  the freudian mechanisms can be applied to them
just as well and just as logically   if an analysis is fully carried out
along the directions of these instincts we find  according to my
observations  the same disturbances that we find from conflicts with the
sexual instinct and effected by the same mechanisms  amongst these instincts
besides anger there is the parental instinct  containing  if we follow mr 
mcdougall s terminology  tender feeling or love  at any rate love is an
instinct entirely distinct from the sexual instinct  there are also the
instinct of self assertion and  fully as important as any  that of
self abasement  this last  according to my observations and interpretations
plays a very important part in many cases of psycho neurosis and leads
through conflicts to the same disturbances of personality that one finds
brought about by conflicts between the other instincts  that love may be
something entirely separate and distinct from the sexual instinct is a view
which is generally recognized and accepted by psychological writers but
entirely ignored  as a rule  by freudian writers  a criticism which i would
make of the work of the freudians is that while they recognize these
instincts they do not give them their full value nor study them as
completely and thoroughly  nor do they carry their studies to the final
logical conclusion  as they do with the sexual instinct  so far as they may
do so they subordinate these instinctive emotions entirely to the sexual
instinct so that these latter simply make use of them  when the
psycho neuroses are completely studied we will find the same repression of
the various instinctive dispositions and impulses to which i have referred
in the one case as in the other  and of ideas organized with these
disposition   we find the same conflicts and resulting disturbances  the
sexual instinct has no hegemony   to my mind each occupies precisely the
same position and may play the same part in personality 

when you bear in mind that psychologically it is a fact  as i believe  that
sentiments are formed by the organization of emotional instincts with ideas 
with the memories of experiences  as shand has pointed out  and when you
remember that it is through the force of emotional instincts thus organized
that an idea  i e   a sentiment  acquires its driving force which tends to
carry the idea to fulfilment  and when you bear in mind that sentiments thus
formed are derived from antecedent experiences sometimes dating back to
childhood and sometimes persisting through life  we can understand how
conflicts arise between antagonistic sentiments and the part which the
different instincts  through the force of their impulses  play in these
conflicts 

furthermore when we bear in mind that sentiments thus originating and
organized are conserved in the subconscious forming what i call the
 setting  which gives idea meaning  the meaning being the most important
component of any idea  and when we bear in mind that this subconscious
setting is an integral part of the total mechanism of thought  each
sentiment in the setting striving to carry itself to completion  and for
this purpose repressing every conflicting sentiment  i think we find a
satisfactory explanation of the disturbances due to conflict in the
psycho neuroses  such a mechanism gives full value to any one and all of the
emotional instincts without giving primacy to any one 

dr  walter b  swift  boston   in regard to the origin of emotions  i
understood dr  hall to say that they were not instinct  of late i have been
observing two young children develop certain emotions  the starting point of
that development has seemed to be in the imitation of motions seen in
others   it is plain to see that this is along the line of the james lange
hypothesis   so that before these motions were seen there was no emotion in
the child   if these motions were observed and imitated by the children then
the emotions developed  i would  therefore  like to ask president hall
whether he would consider imitation of motion seen in another as the
starting point of the development of emotion 

dr  tom williams  washington  d  c   the value of formulation we know  it
has been well illustrated by dr  hall s paper that he has by definite
concept followed out by investigation of this  the disadvantage of
formulation is very well shown by over formulation by the scholastics in the
middle ages   i think dr  hall s wonderful contribution to our psychological
researches should be kept in mind by those who have excessively formulated
in a certain direction in order that some of us at least may apply to some
of the other emotions what others have attempted concerning libido  dr 
prince has long appealed for other methods than those which have been
applied so exclusively to the sexuality  in reference to the manifestation
of the anger trend  for instance  it may be not only a definitely conscious
manifestation  but it may perhaps produce a crisis even in dream thought  i
am speaking of a case   a young boy at boarding school who was a musical
genius had been very much bullied  he suffered a great deal from this  but
did not retaliate until one night in the dormitory with eight boys while
asleep  he being badgered by neighbors  got up while asleep and attacked
these larger boys and discomfited them   it was the subject of conversation
in the dormitory  whether he was really asleep or not  the boy became so
terrible in his anger on future occasions and so successful as a fighter
that his bullying thereafter ceased  and his status in the school thereafter
was different  whether this really occurred in a dream state or was mere
simulation i cannot say 

dr  a  a  brill  new york city   i must say that the mechanisms described so
interestingly by pres   hall are found in our patients during analysis and i
believe that almost all of them belong to the love and hate principles  this
may not seem so on superficial examination  thus  i have on record nine
cases of women who were suffering from various forms of psychoneurosis  one
of whose symptoms was screaming   every once in a while they had to scream 
it was an obsessive screaming   questioning elicited that the screaming
always occurred when they were thinking of some terrible or painful thought 
for instance  one woman went through fancies of killing her husband and when
she came to the idea of shooting him  she began to scream  here one might
think that it was an ethical struggle which had nothing to do with sex  but
if one considers that it was against her husband that her anger was
directed  that she wished to kill him because he abused her and that there
was another man in the case  it becomes quite clear that the anger had a
sexual motive 

concerning new formulations  i feel that there is nothing against
promulgating new attitudes and theories  provided one has sufficient cause
for doing so  formulations based on insufficient data and hastily
constructed are dangerous  to say the least   prof  freud is most careful in
formulating new theories  he gathers his material for years before he puts
it forth in the form of tentative theories and does not hesitate to modify
them if occasion demands  nor is it true that the freudians ignore the work
done by others  freud and his followers give due credit to other observers 
but as the freudian mechanisms have opened up so many new fields for
investigation  we naturally give most of our time to this work  that does
not at all signify that we ignore everything else  as some believe  freud
himself continually urges that the psychoanalytic problems should be taken
up by observers in other fields than medicine and i was  therefore 
extremely pleased to hear prof  hall s formulations of anger  i do not
believe  however  that his paper shows that we are overestimating the sexual
impulse   basically  all his mechanisms come under the heading of  sex   as
we understand it 

dr  l  e  emerson  boston  mass   i wish to express my delight in president
hall s paper   it seems to me what he has done has been to show the breadth
of the freudian conception of sex  the word sex as the freudians use it 
includes all personal relations and even personality  and it is apparently
in question only as to whether one is going to draw a line at one place and
say everything on this side is sex and the other side personality  or
whether one is going to enlarge the concept of sex to include personality 
that as i understand it  is what dr  white has also said  it seems to me the
value of the sex conception lies in the fact that while it can be expanded 
and is illimitable  at the same time it focuses  it does come to a point 
personalities as talked of ordinarily have no point  they are too vague   on
the other hand  a man who has a mind no bigger than a pinhole is too
circumscribed to be capable of understanding any very broad generalization 
if one can grasp a conception that does have a center  even though no
circumference  he has got hold of a very valuable generalization 

dr  e  e  southard  boston   dr  jelliffe has just brought into ridicule
what he terms  pinhole psychiatry   but as i remember it  there is a
technical method in psychology whereby things may be more clearly visible
through a pin hole 

the valuable thing about president hall s communication is that the
fundamental distinction is brought out between two groups of workers in
psychopathology   i should be inclined to divide the people in this room
into what might be termed emotional monists and emotional pluralists  the
freudian theory is in general a theory of emotional monism and therefore
fundamentally must satisfy a great many of the hegelian tenets  hence 
perhaps dr  putnam s adherence to both hegel and freud   now as i understand
it  what dr  prince wants is an emotional pluralism such as might well be
founded upon the data in macdougall s  social psychology  and in shand s
work on  the foundations of character    this view of emotional pluralism is
one which i should myself be compelled to hold  we must remember  however 
that the work of cannon on various types of emotion may possibly show that
different emotions which look vastly unlike  e  g  fear and rage  may be in
some sense equivalents  fear may be equivalent to rage much as different
types of energy in the physical universe are equivalent to one another  the
emotions may be interchangeable in some sense so that it might be possible
that sex emotion and the emotion of fear are translatable  in this way there
might be constructed a fundamental monism of emotion in the same sense that
energetics is a science which unifies electricity  heat  magnetism  etc   it
would not seem to me  however  appropriate to identify all kinds of emotion
with the sexual 

president hall   it would take an encylopedia and an omniscient mind  and
many hours and days to exhaust such a topic as this  dr  southard has said
some of the things i would have said   i supposed this society was primarily
interested in pragmatic discussions  at any rate  i left the american
philosophical society some years ago and entered this to get rid of
metaphysics and arid abstractions  as to what dr  swift says  it seems to me
imitation plays a great but is by no means the sole role   it is of course
purely instinctive  and the social instinct comes in everywhere  so much so
that discussion on almost any topic is liable to raise the question of the
individual versus the social forces in the world  as to dr  jelliffe s
opinion whether after all hate and love are at bottom the same  he perhaps
bottoms on the recent discussions of what i might call the expanded theory
of ambivalence  as represented by weissfeld   but i do not interpret this to
mean that there is any sense whatever that has any pragmatic value in the
statement that love and hate are the same  if you assume this  one is dizzy
and the world seems to spin around  hegel showed a sense in which being and
not being are the same but that is a most abstract and purely methodological
statement  what in the world is more opposite than love and hate  from every
practical and truly psychological point of view  we must not be credulous
about the unconscious and ascribe to it absurdities  nor must we lose our
orientation for surely up and down  right and left  light and dark  do
differ  if the unconscious can be used to cause a darkness in which
everything loses its identity and fuses into a general menstrum  as hegel
said all cows were black in the dark  it seems to me we can get nowhere 
ought we not to start by admitting that there are certain immense
differences in the emotions  whether conscious or unconscious  and that the
tendency to find a common background or identify them is a matter largely of
speculative interest

discussion

dr  e  e  southard  boston   idiopathic epilepsy as found in massachusetts
material and estimated from the appearances in the gross anatomy of the
brain occurs in about one of every three cases  there are accordingly more
idiopathic epilepsies than there are idiopathic or  functional  psychoses 
if the data of gross anatomy form a reliable index 

it was a somewhat curious thing that in a series of cases investigated by
dr  thom and myself  that the more frequent the attacks of epilepsy the less
there seemed to be to show for them in the autopsied brains  in certain
cases with daily attacks the brains were strictly normal in gross
appearances   it was the frankly organic cases with large focal lesions that
had the occasional attacks  these frankly organic cases rarely had high
frequency attacks 

dr  tom a  williams  washington  d  c   will dr  clark explain the eccentric
convulsions such as when there is uraemia  on similar grounds  also  if he
will postulate in such cases as recover with metabolic treatment  i have
published cases in which recurrent attacks of some years duration were
removed by means which considered only the metebolesia   see journal of
neurology and psychiatry  march  1915  

dr  john t  maccurdy  new york   i have held the opinion for some years that
the study of epilepsy was going to be of greater psychiatric moment than
that of any other condition  i feel that this promise has been very largely
fulfilled by the work dr  clark has been doing for the last two years  we
have found  i think  from that work that we can really shell out what we may
term an epileptic reaction  which is really the most primitive of all
psychiatric reaction   it corresponds to a flight from reality   it is a
return to the subjective phase  which  in the psychoses  is no vague but a
very real thing  in epilepsy we get it in pure culture as a lapse of
consciousness  expressed either in completeness as in a grand mal attack or
partially when consciousness is merely clouded  sleep probably represents an
analogous condition  we go to sleep to repair the body while psychologically
we are seeking that flight from reality which we all long for  the
convulsion may be a secondary affair  and a physiological sequel to the loss
of consciousness  which is psychologically determined 

l  pierce clark   for the time being i am anxious to limit my remarks to the
mechanism of essential epilepsy  and  not to convulsive disorders in
general  however closely allied to idiopathic epilepsy  at some future time
i hope to take up the epileptoid convulsions and show their relationship and
variation from that of the mechanism of essential epilepsy   i may say 
however  that i have some data already at hand in which certain types of
epileptic phenomena connected with infantile cerebral hemiplegia would show
that the so called epileptic constitution is much less marked in these
cases  but is present  however  to a certain degree  as has been well known
for a number of years and commented upon by such observers as gowers 
jackson and binswanger  the so called hemiplegic epilepsies sooner or later
develop the epileptic alteration in a character analogous to that seen in
idiopathic epilepsy  i hope to show that the main roots of the so called
epileptic alteration in general necessarily lie in the primary make up of
such individuals  and that the seizure phenomena of epilepsy only intensify
and make more marked the fundamental make up when the disease has definitely
fastened itself upon the individual  my next paper on this whole subject
will attempt to show more conclusively that the epileptic seizures are but
an unfoldment of that which has already been existent in the biological
make up of the individual epileptic

discussion

dr  james j  putnam  boston   i am very much interested in dr  burrow s
paper and understand it as illustrating the argument brought forward by him
last night   as i remember the situation i do not quite see why this idea is
not essentially the same that has been endorsed by freud and others  one s
interest in one s self is certainly in part the basis of homosexuality  and
this is intensified by the reflection from the mother 

dr  john t  mac curdy  new york   when dr  burrow first brought up this
subject last year it struck me as being the most original theory in
psychoanalysis that had been formulated in this country and one of the most
important of all the additions to our general psychoanalytic concepts 
personally  i found that it immediately solved certain problems which had
been in my mind for some time   i had never been able to see how it came
about that the alcoholic had a strong latent homosexuality  the ordinary
interpretations of drinking as a fellatoristic substitute has always seemed
unlikely  for  if this were so any liquid would serve the purpose  so why
alcohol  now it is manifest that the alcoholic is an individual who is
taking a drug which dulls his sensibility   that is a way of retiring from
reality  of getting away from objectivity  retiring from what dr  burrow
calls the subjective phase  now we understand why the patient in an acute
alcoholic hallucinosis almost invariably hears voices making homosexual
accusations  the unreality complex is translated into sexual terms and he is
accused of unreal love   i have been struck in dream analysis by the almost
constant coincidence in dreams of mutterleib symbols in the same dream that
on analysis proved to be homosexual in principle   i can quote one dream
that demonstrates dramatically every point which dr  burrow makes in his
thesis  this patient  a man who was being treated for homosexual tendencies
which worried him a great deal  on one of the first days brought this dream 
he was a hospital interne  someone came to him and said a nurse had cut
herself  he ran up to the surgical amphitheatre where preparations were made
to fix her wound   he suddenly discovered that his was the cut and that it
was on the ventral surface of the penis corresponding to the primitive
subincision operation  he took up a needle  sewed it up and put on a
bandage  at the end of the dream he wondered what was going to happen 
whether the bandage would come off or not   any psychoanalyst can imagine
what the incision indicated  that it led directly to the idea of a vagina 
also to the idea of castration which is combined with that   the bandage led
to swaddling clothes  here we have the whole situation rehearsed   the
associations went to the mother   the mother changes into himself  at the
same time he represents himself with a vagina and gives birth to a child 
his own penis which he can fondle as his mother did him 

dr  smith ely jelliffe  new york   it seems to me the phrase identification
with the mother is very illuminating  i have no doubt that dr  burrow would
say that the failure to develop away from this primary identification lies
at the basis of what is called narcissism   i have noted this identification
with the mother  i   e   with the female  in many patients  they are  in
ordinary life  after making a very hard fight with unconscious homosexual
trends and are managing themselves with great difficulty   this shows
particularly in the analysis of alcoholics especially of periodic types 
self fertilization is a frequent symbol in the unconscious  in males 
particularly  the identification with the mother is a frequent factor and
often explains the value of the instinctively sought relief through narcosis
and withdrawal from the conflict  male hysterias also show it markedly   the
aggression towards the father is a frequent female symbolization in hysteria
as well 

dr  trigant burrow  baltimore   it seems to me that the president s
reference to this heterosexual instance need not necessarily be heterosexual
in a psychological sense  it is important to recognize that though the
object of the male in a particular case be a woman  yet psychologically this
need not be a heterosexual adaptation   in the case i have cited the
relation of the patient to his wife is psychologically a homosexual one  we
have seen in this case the presence of a profound neurosis and coexistent
with it an apparently normal sexual life  this we know from the freudian
standpoint is impossible  the heterosexual adaptation is but apparent 

dr  trigant burrow  baltimore   in regard to dr putnam s comment that my
thesis contains what has been said already by freud   undoubtedly to a large
extent it has  there is  though  some modification here which seems to me of
importance  if only in the way of an extension of freud s original
conception   one gets a very clear idea from brill s excellent paper on
homosexuality of freud s essential thesis  here the idea of homosexuality is
that of a revulsion from the mother   the child is assumed to adapt itself
as the mother in order to get rid of the mother as object  this first
hypothesis related only to the male child  to explain homosexuality in the
female  either an analogous mechanism must be assumed  according to which
the female child adopts homosexuality to escape the father image  and
analysis does not bear out this explanation  or  assuming the same reaction
in respect to the mother in the female as in the male  the result would
entail not homosexuality but a heightened heterosexuality  i think the
formulation i have here advanced offers us a distinct advantage in placing
the causative factor in homosexuality in either sex upon an identical
genetic basis

dr  e  e  southard  boston  read a paper entitled   data concerning
delusions of personality     

    published in this number of the journal  p  241 

discussion

dr  smith ely jelliffe  new york   dr  southard has heretofore launched us
upon very large subjects   i can well recall in one of his previous
communications the fascinating correlations drawn between structural changes
and the character of the psychological signs   in dementia praecox
particularly  he has shown us how auditory symptoms group about temporal
atrophies and optical signs with the occipital and so forth and so on  he
now proposes to thrust us into a larger and much more intricate sphere of
activity as to the representation in the cortex of other changes which as he
has described are inframicroscopical or inframacroscopical  in other words 
there must be some type of correlation between the projection in the
cerebral structure of the organ itself which is cerebrally represented and
certain mental signs   if i see what dr  southard has been thinking about 
we are certainly engaged in a very fascinating topic  it is well known from
the standpoint of topographical cerebral correlation that the brain is
nothing but a series of body symbols  as it were  adler has entered this
field and approaches the problem by saying that the inferior organ  liver 
kidney  or what not  is related to a similar defective cerebral
representation of the organ  thus introducing into the nemological mechanism
the task of compensating for the defective structure  dr  southard wishes to
try to map out these defects in the cerebral structures and thus reason
backwards to the somatic inferiority  i confess he lifts me into ideal
regions   such stimuli are enjoyable and provocative of development 

dr  tom a  williams  washington  d  c   i conceive dr  southard s purpose
somewhat differently from dr  jelliffe whose thought seems to be somewhat
like that of henry head when he published his paper in reference to
hallucinations  corresponding to various head zones in correspondence with
different visceral areas and with special sense organs  eye  ear and so on 
i have conceived dr  southard as being a direct chemical in line with
folius  pathology researches  if that is the case we have a great many
clinical cases which might be underlined with his central thought 

president hall   it is almost too good to be true if dr  southard has really
made connections between delusions of personality and the great topic of
character   it illustrates the old hippocratic saw   god like is the man who
is also a philosopher   character might almost be called a name for all the
mysteries of psychology  and from mill s ethology and the old phrenologies
of temperament that wundt adopts with slight modifications  we have really
made little progress   it seems to me very significant that dr  southard
should interest himself  as his paper leads one to judge he does  in such
problems as shand s somewhat abstract work  and should seek correlations
with legal characterology like that of roscoe pound   it would be of great
interest to know whether dr  southard obtained his differentiations purely
from pathological cases or whether  accepting shand or pound or both  using
their distinctions as apperceptive organs  he unconsciously reads their
distinctions into his cases  his paper  at any rate  is a genuine
contribution as well as an encouragement to those who seek to correlate the
normal with the abnormal 

dr  james j  putnam  boston   i only want to express my warm sympathy with
dr  southard s scheme   this careful working out of correlations one would
say is a good method of scientific research and must lead to something  i
think dr  southard would rather avoid the suggestion of causes for the
results that he found  but the method appears safe and profitable 

dr  john t  maccurdy  new york   as another psychoanalyst it gives me
pleasure to hear this paper   as a psychoanalyst  and one who has done most
of his work with the delusions  of the insane  i must say that i have felt
all along that psychoanalysis fails utterly when it tries to account for the
manifest content of a delusion   we can trace the psychological stages from
the manifest content in varying delusions back to a more or less constant
unconscious striving   the latent content   the tendency of this latent
content to appear as delusions depends on a defect of adaptation  which must
have a physical basis probably of a general nature  the delusions  in many
cases  are symbols of the latent content  from a psycho analytic standpoint 
the problem presented in dr  southard s paper is  why is a certain symbol
chosen in one case and another in another individual   it may well be that
specific organic factors operate here  one could imagine that the mechanism
is purely psychological  in a hepatic condition  for instance  the attention
of the patient may be directed to that part of the body which is affected by
the pathological process in the liver and that for this reason the ideas
which appear refer to generations in that region  at least we may hope for
definite and interesting results from elaboration of the method outlined by
dr  southard s statistics 

dr  southard   i am rather astonished and well pleased at the cordial
reception of my little statistical work on delusions and upon the elaborate
discussion   as to dr  hall s question whether my data were collected to
prove the a priori contention concerning the correlation of unpleasantness
with lesions below the diaphragm  i would say that i expressed a suspicion
of this correlation in my paper on  how far is the environment responsible
for delusions    journal of abnormal psychology  june july  1913   i was
stimulated to finish my article by the appearance of shand s book on  the
foundations of character  and the articles on  personality  by prof  roscoe
pound which have been appearing in the harvard law review

dr  john t  maccurdy  new york  read a joint paper  with dr  w  t  treadway 
entitled  constructive delusions   2 

 2  published in the august september number  p  153  of this journal 

discussion 

dr  william a  white  washington  d  c   spoke of his interest in the paper
and his agreement with it   he suggested that it might be quite proper to
use the term  archaic  in speaking of this type of delusions  he also
commented on the recurrence of the excitement in the case of the last
patient quoted which  he suggested  might represent a physical periodicity
as the individual had a homosexual component in his make up  so that it
might be reasonable to suppose that this was fundamentally sex periodicity 

president hall   sex periodicity in males is very interesting  a student of
mine many years ago kept his own record for some years and published it
anonymously in my journal  as did another some ten years ago  and the
twenty eight day cycle seemed very marked in the first and somewhat so in
the last of these papers  they are certainly interesting to the geneticist 
we now often speak of dreams as protectors of sleep   i am inclined to think
that a good many delusions are protectors of sanity in much the same way 
and i am not at all sure that we cannot say that we shall ere long see that
this is to a great extent true for the imagination  if this patient had a
less vivid fancy perhaps his delusions would have been kept less fluid and
his sanity would have been better protected  is there not a relation between
floridness of fancy which passes easily over to delusions  just as creative
geniuses are allied to artists   but may there not be an inverse correlation
between great liveliness and activity of fancy and liability to fixed
delusions   at any rate  from the normal standpoint we are seeing more and
more that man lives on a genetic scale   this might be illustrated by the
many cases  some of them pretty well analyzed  of cat phobias  the greatest
enemies of mankind were once the felidae  and the theory now is that this
type is made up of very definite elements  viz   sharp claws  stealthy
tread  eyes that shine in the dark  power to leap far and suddenly  a
uniquely developed voice  etc   now the cat phobiacs generally focus on some
one of these traits in consciousness  but analysis seems to show that the
rest of them reinforce the one that experience happens to thrust forward
into the center of the field of consciousness  in general it seems to me
that it is a great educational advantage to keep open the experiences that
connect us with the past of the race  and it may have a psychotherapeutic
value which we do not now dream  years ago a new york paper investigated 
with the aid of many of its reporters  and found hundreds of people fishing
off the wharves of new york on sunday  very few of whom caught any fish  and
many who did threw them back   they were reverting to the old piscatorial
stage  feeling again the old thrill of a nibble on the hook  and went home
refreshed  even if they had not had a bite  because they had been able to
drop back into an ancient stratum of the soul which was sound  so that they
came back to the hard reality of the next day refreshed  play in general 
too  we now regard as reversionary  and i cannot but believe that many
delusions are precisely the same 

dr  tom a  williams  washington  d  c   dr  hall has cited the cat phobia in
illustration that the belief that dr  maccurdy developed may be one in which
there may be philogenetic reasons for the phenomena  it seems to me that
before we use such data we need analyses more complete than has been given
for any of them   his citation brought to my mind a case i am working with
now  a cat phobia  the cat does not represent sharp eyes and claws   the cat
is a definite symbol of definite sexual occurrences in childhood   i should
like to ask whether it would be here desired to draw philogenetic
conclusions  i think not without the further analysis which would be
necessary  i have a very strong distrust of the efforts which jung and
abrahams have made  followed by some of us  to draw analogy between the
morphological changes and the psychological experiences of the race as
reproductions in the life history of the individual 

dr  e  e  southard   i should be inclined to feel that much of the
disturbance in the constructive delusion group would be structurally founded
upon normal or abnormal conditions in the parietal lobe  at any rate cases
with hyperphantasia in my recent dementia praecox series  american journal
of insanity  1914 15  appear to be correlated with parietal lobe anomalies
and atrophies   it is a curious thing that such subjects with
hyperphantastic delusions are very often good institutional workers 
although a delusion of persecution by poison is an exceedingly simple
delusion  it is in a sense far more harmful to the organism and may be often
far more productive of motor results in a patient than an elaborate
psuedo scientific theory such as constructed by dr  maccurdy s patient  it
is obvious that the degree of disease does not vary directly with the
simplicity of the delusion 

it seems to me that dr  maccurdy s work has not only theoretical interest
but also practical importance from the standpoint of prognosis 

dr  walter b  swift  boston   i often wonder if we are not a little inclined
to go too far back for explanations  in football it is recognized that the
men on the field have two sets of reflexes out of which they play under
different circumstances  one is a set that they have learned in the lower
schools  and the other is the reflex circle that they use after they have
been trained differently in college  when these men get tired it is a
psychological observation that they go back to those first learned reflex
mechanisms  that is  when tired  they play the football of the secondary
schools  something similar occurs in stammering   when a case is trained to
have a higher reflex vocalization  and they learn to vocalize spontaneously 
it inhibits their stammering  but when they get tired they revert again   in
the subject under discussion are we not reaching too far back for sources 
should we not go to infancy or early childhood  to the old reflex circle
there  rather than to ones we suppose are inherited 

dr  tom a  williams  washington  d  c   my remarks do not apply to the
contents of the delusions  of course  but to the cerebral capacities merely
which were susceptible of the formation of such delusions 

dr  smith ely jelliffe  new york   dr  maccurdy s paper fascinated me a
great deal   there is so much material that one is in a maze  i am sorry 
moreover  that he had to mutilate his conclusions by being forced by lack of
time to condense them   it strikes me he gives us a very important
contribution to the mechanism of the cure of some psychoses   that mechanism
of cure  may be stated as follows  how can one take the split off libido
which results from the analytic technique and apply it to a better
constructive synthesis  it would seem that these constructive delusions
really correspond to interpretative schemes whereby a certain amount of the
split off libido becomes synthesized   in that sense these delusions are
constructive and are  therefore  helpful to the patient  they represent
partial curative processes 

dr  john t  maccurdy  new york   i would like to refer briefly  first  to
the point made by dr  white to the effect that these ideas were interesting
in so far as they were archaic  that is true and it is one of the
profoundest truths we have to offer  at the same time it is of psychological
and not strictly speaking of psychiatric value   the purpose of my paper was
essentially psychiatric  to point out that there is a prognostic value in
such delusion as i have tried to outline  now one can get archaic delusions
in patients very much deteriorated  the point of this paper is rather to
show  as the discussion brought out  that it is the constructive tendency
operating in the insane as it has historically in the race  the second point
as to the cycle in his attacks  to follow the inference of dr  white  i
presume he meant to imply that there may have been some organic swing
corresponding to the psychotic swing   that of course is quite possible  at
the same time the analysis of this case showed that purely psychic factors
had a great deal to do with it  his monthly attacks seemed to represent a
break in the balance  he was always in unstable equilibrium and the factor
that seemed to decide the issue finally between relative sanity and a
markedly deteriorated state  was a purely psychological one  when his father
died  when he was released from that bondage  the relief seemed just enough
to decide the issue  so the organic factors here seem to be the general 
underlying inability to adapt himself   one of the hardest situations to
adapt himself to was his relations with his father  if he could not free
himself he was going to be very insane  when that factor was removed he
became relatively insane 

dr  tom a  williams  washington  d  c   read a paper entitled   the origin
of supernatural explanations     

    published in this number of the journal  p  236 

discussion

dr  e  e  southard  boston   are all these somatic explanations of
metaphysics 

dr  williams   largely 

dr  smith ely jelliffe  new york   i recall a note in one of dr  jones 
papers in which he says  that in the future our reason will be used to
explain things   heretofore it has been used to explain them away  

dr  tom a  williams  washington  d  c   i am not prepared to make any
predictions about a thousand years from now  that is in the air  i mention
not the levels at all  nor do i speak of  decerebrate metaphysics   nor do i
speak of metaphysics at all unless one would imply that what i have called
supernatural explanations needs must be metaphysical  i do not speak of
cerebral functions per se   i was simply speaking of states of feelings 
the source and origin i did not go into  i simply made an attempt to imply
that such states of feeling were responsible for the discomfort and feeling
of inadequacy of the patient  and as dr  jelliffe has well repeated that the
victim attempts to rationalize this in supernatural fashion and that this
may be not at all dependent upon the notion of the supernatural universe he
has imbibed as a child  it is a construing of natural means for getting out
of a difficulty 

dr  l  e  emerson  boston  read a paper entitled  the psycho analytic
treatment of hystero epilepsy     

    reserved for publication 

discussion

dr  john t  maccurdy  new york   i have been very much interested in this
paper by dr  emerson and the part that has interested me most in it has been
the therapeutic side   i cannot feel  however  that it adds a great deal to
our knowledge of epilepsy  that is  of idiopathic epilepsy  that  of course 
is a tremendously difficult problem to tackle  if we are to regard it as a
psychosis then we expect it to show other reactions  just as dementia
praecox shows manic depressive symptoms  if we are to find out what the
epileptic reaction is  we must study it in those who are typically epileptic
and nothing else   or else we may examine those with transitional states
grading over into hysteria  for example  excluding from our formulations
everything in them that is hysteric   this last case which dr  emerson
brought forward seemed to me to represent what is essentially an hysteric
reaction  the convulsive movements this man went through were symbolic  it
is difficult to regard these movements in epilepsy as symbolic because in
the true epileptic there is as typical unconsciousness as we know  how can
anything going on in almost absolute unconsciousness represent something
symbolic to the individual   this is possible however  when the condition
grades off from the hysteric side into the epileptic  the fundamental
epileptic phenomenon is the disturbance of consciousness  and that is what
must be explained 

dr  tom a  williams  washington  d  c   i don t know that we can say that
the fundamental differentiation of epilepsy is the unconsciousness   that is
a psychological division  the paper did not give any differential why they
were regarded as epileptics at all   there was no description of the
convulsion  except in so far as this formed the hysteric form of convulsion 
so i don t think we are in a position to discuss the paper without more
clear data of these instances 

dr  walter b  swift  boston   i was interested in hearing about the case of
stammering   that will be explained in my own paper and i have also run up
against several who have done the same  i should like to ask dr  emerson if
he considers stammering as an expression of an orgasm 

dr  l  e  emerson  boston   dr  maccurdy well remarked that this adds
nothing to the understanding of epilepsy   in a certain sense this is true 
i do not feel that i could add anything to a deeper understanding of
epilepsy   the whole development of psycho analytic theory  up to a certain
point  has been based on the actual recovery of patients  if you do not like
the use of the word cure  from particular symptoms  then this has been
generalized   now that has opened an enormous field for ratiocination 
therefore  i am not at all sure that these conceptions will really apply to
essential epilepsies or to the real epilepsies  i do not know how far our
conceptions which originate in the therapeutic situation will apply to the
situation which appears to be absolutely beyond therapeutics   in regard to
what dr  white said of starting from the known and going through
transitional stages to the unknown  you do get insight and it may be that
the condition as described in this broad way by clark and by stekel and
others may be true  but i am not perfectly sure  i am very grateful for dr 
allen s approval of this way of putting things because perhaps it is a
defence reaction on my own part that occasionally i feel it necessary to
report things i have seen with my own eyes and really experienced  instead
of following my natural tendency to go off into vague philosophizing 



reviews

psychology in daily life   by carl emil seashore   1914  xviii plus 226 pp  
n  y   d  appleton   co 

this is the first volume of the  conduct of mind  series  the purpose of
which  as stated by its editor  professor joseph jastrow  in his
introduction to the series  is  to provide readily intelligible surveys of
selected aspects of the study of mind and its applications    the present
work contains seven chapters  which were originally prepared as
 semi popular addresses   as a consequence  the book lacks somewhat in
coherence  but  except in a few places  the emphasis is practical
throughout  it is perhaps not surprising that the most subtle and modern
part of the discussion  viz   the chapter on  mental law  should be the
least practical in its bearing 

in the first chapter is discussed the practical importance of  play   not
only in offering the opportunity for sensory  central  and motor development
in the child  but for releasing the broader life energies of the adult whose
mind is confined by specializing work  it is shown that the fundamental
motives of the play life are to be found in religion 

the next three chapters  on  serviceable memory    mental efficiency   and
 mental health   are full of sound practical advice  the first contains a
clear and attractive presentation of the principles of remembering  so
arranged as to exemplify the rules which it inculcates  the second
emphasizes the importance of the wave form of attention in all mental work 
the superiority of efferent to afferent response as an educational process 
and the acquirement of mastery by a transfer of control from higher to lower
mental levels   there is also good counsel with regard to the best time and
manner in which to rest  although the author s deductions from the
physiological  curve of sleep  appear somewhat hasty    mental health  is
defined in terms of our mental  members  in the classical way  and the  ten
maxims of wise living   which are given  are selected from the history of
moral philosophy rather than from current psychotherapeutic results 

the chapter on  mental law  is the most interesting one for the theoretical
psychologist  and discusses in a general but illuminating manner  principles
of perception and of perseveration which are of interest to the
psychological psychiatrist   the chapter on  law in illusion  seems
disproportionately long  but gives an interesting description and analysis
of three different types of illusions   those based on  units of direction  
the over estimation of  cylinder height   and upon the  size weight  error 
in connection with the second  the results of original investigations in the
author s laboratory are presented  it is shown that a knowledge of the
complex but definite principles underlying illusions can be made practically
serviceable  for example  in tests of mental normality 

the final chapter deals with a specific illustrative problem in  mental
measurement   viz   the determination of a subject s fitness for a musical
career   a detailed analysis of the problem is offered  and it is shown that
the elemental questions involved can be answered by the methods of the
psychological laboratory  but that these answers require expert
interpretation before they can be made practically applicable 

the author s style is engaging and clear   leonard thompson troland 

an outline of psychobiology   by knight dunlap  associate professor of
psychology in the johns hopkins university   baltimore  the johns hopkins
press  1914   pp  121  octavo  illustrated 

this volume even though brief will be highly appreciated by very many
students of normal and of abnormal psychology because it is the first book
to afford them just what  in an elementary way  they need concerning the
nervous system  the essential musculatures  and the epithelia  whose
manifold activities are in some certain mode concomitant to the succession
of compound mental events   surely  and widely  those who a few years ago
 came to scoff  at the ever rising scientific stream of mind protoplasm
relationship will  remain to pray  to the rising and satisfying goddess of
the new philosophy  the body with its unimagined intricacies and beauties of
still unguessed adaptation and its marvels of someone s ingenuity is surely
now at length coming into its own   and when  after the years  it has come
into its own in a reasonable measure   the continuity of mind and energy 
and  the dynamic spiritualism of the cosmos  when they are mentioned will no
longer draw that quasi withering smile of toleration to the face of the
orthodox psychologist with which some of us are familiar 

this volume  happily devised by professor dunlap to meet this real need  at
first in his own pupils and later in a wider public  will materially help
this progress  for it has within it in fairly up to date and simple form
much of the structure and function  always of surpassing interest when
understood  of the human action system  seventy seven excellently clear and
well chosen illustrations make the well printed text still more informing 
there is a good index  and short lists of books at the ends of the chapters 

the present reviewer notes only one omission of substantial importance from
the neurologic part of the book  and that is the very recent  howbeit
important  matter of the functional opposition between the sympathetic
proper and the other  the cranio sacral  portion of  the autonomic    the
work lacks also  in this first edition  a statement and discussion of the
important all or none principle which is now applicable to voluntary muscle 
probably  and to the neurones  and it is to be hoped too that the author
will take the bull by the horns and  in the next edition  show the nature of
protoplasm in general in an homologous way  as the basis  through its
uniquely complex kineticism  of the onward rush of the mental process  with
this addition the essential nature of irritability too might be set forth in
this already valuable  and inexpensive  treatise  george v  n  dearborn

psychology  general and applied   hugo munsterberg new york and london   d 
appleton and co   1914  pp  xiv x487 1 75 

in this volume  designed to serve the needs both of the general reader and
of the college student  professor munsterberg has represented in most
readable form the essentials of the entire range of his contributions to
psychology   the well known differentiation of the  two psychologies  is the
core of the book  herewith is reintroduced the psychology of the soul  not
merely as being on a level with  but ultimately even superordinate to  the
descriptive psychology which had banished from so many systems all mention
of the soul or even of the self  for we are shown how all description and
explanation  whether of material objects or of conscious processes  is after
all but construction in the service of purposes  to apprehend  understand 
and realize which is the primary business  of life 

this exposition of purposive psychology  surely the most novel feature of
the book  is what interests us most  and we discover with disappointment
that though theoretically every conscious state is subject matter for either
type of psychology  i e  may be either described in its causal relationships
or immediately grasped as an act of will  still professor munsterberg fills
five times as many pages with the usual descriptive psychology as with this
newer departure  we willingly conceded the importance of tradition in
textbook writing  but would urge upon professor munsterberg the impatience
with which we await more extended treatment of this topic 

a second deviation for a book of this type   if professor munsterberg may
rightly be said ever to write books typical of anything but his own
uniqueness   is the inclusion of a section on social psychology  this too 
we are inclined to regard as in nature of a promise  representing the
germination of lines of thought which we are assured elsewhere    are later
to receive more elaborate formulation

the sex worship and symbolism of primitive races

by sanger brown ii   m  d 

assistant physician  bloomingdale hospital 

psychiatry  during recent years  has found it to its advantage to turn to a
number of related sciences and allied branches of study for the explanation
of a number of the peculiar symptoms of abnormal mental states   of these
related studies  none have been of greater value than those which throw
light on the mental development of either the individual or the race  in
primitive races we discover a number of inherent motives which are of
interest from the standpoint of mental development  these motives are
expressed in a very interesting symbolism  it is the duty of the
psychiatrist to see to what extent these primitive motives operate
subconsciously in abnormal mental conditions  and also to learn whether an
insight into the symbolism of mental diseases may be gained  through
comparison  by a study of the symbolism of primitive races   in the
following communication one particular motive with its accompanying
symbolism is dealt with  the application of these findings must be left with
the psychiatrist in his clinical studies 

a great many of the institutions and usages of our present day civilization
originated at a very early period in the history of the race  many of these
usages are carried on in modified form century after century  after they
have lost the meaning which they originally possessed  it must be
remembered  however  that in primitive races they were of importance  and
they arose because they served a useful end  from the study of these
remnants of former days  we are able to learn the trends of thought which
activated and inspired the minds of primitive people  when we clearly
understand these motives  we may then judge the extent of their influence on
our present day thought and tendencies 

now  in our present communication  we wish to deal with a motive which we
find expressed very generally in primitive religion  this is the worship of
sex   we not only find evidences of this worship in the records and
monuments of antiquity  but our knowledge of the customs and practices of
certain tribes  studied in comparatively modern times  indicates the
presence of this same primitive religion  we feel that in sex worship we are
dealing with an important motive in racial development  and our object at
present is to give an account of its various phases 

before we proceed  it is desirable to make reference to some of our sources
of information   there are plenty of books on the history of egypt  the
antiquities of india or on the interpretation of oriental customs  which
make scarcely any reference to the deification of sex  we have always been
told  for example  that bacchus was the god of the harvest and that the
greek pan was the god of nature  we have not been told that these same gods
were representations of the male generative attribute  and that they were
worshipped as such  yet  anyone who has access to the statuettes or
engravings of these various deities of antiquity  whether they be of egypt 
of india or of china  cannot fail to see that they were intended to
represent generative attributes   on account of the incompleteness of many
books which describe primitive races  a number of references are given
throughout these pages  and some bibliographical references are added 

simple sex worship

as will be presently shown  we have evidence from a number of sources to
show that sex was at one time frankly and openly worshipped by the primitive
races of mankind  this worship has been shown to be so general and so
widespread  that it is to be regarded as part of the general evolution of
the human mind  it seems to be indigenous with the race  rather than an
isolated or exceptional circumstance 

the american cyclopedia  under phallic worship  reads as follows  in early
ages the sexual emblems were adored as most sacred objects  and in the
several polytheistic systems the act or principle of which the phallus was
the type was represented by a deity to whom it was consecrated  in egypt by
khem  in india by siva  in assyria by vul  in primitive greece by pan  and
later by priapus  in italy by mutinus or priapus  among the teutonic and
scandinavian nations by fricco  and in spain by hortanes   phallic monuments
and sculptured emblems are found in all parts of the world  

rawlinson  in his history of ancient egypt  gives us the following
description of khem    a full egyptian idea of khem can scarcely be
presented to the modern reader  on account of the grossness of the forms
under which it was exhibited  some modern egyptologists endeavor to excuse
or palliate this grossness  but it seems scarcely possible that it should
not have been accompanied by indelicacy of thought or that it should have
failed to exercise a corrupting influence on life and morals  khem  no
doubt  represented to the initiated merely the generative power in nature 
or that strange law by which living organisms  animal and vegetable  are
enabled to reproduce their like  but who shall say in what exact light he
presented himself to the vulgar  who had continually before their eyes the
indecent figures under which the painters and sculptors portrayed him  as
impure ideas and revolting practices clustered around the worship of pan in
greece and later rome  so it is more than probable that in the worship of
khem in egypt were connected similar excesses  besides his priapic or
 ithyphallic  form  khem s character was marked by the assignment to him of
the goat as his symbol  and by his ordinary title ka mutf   the bull of his
mother   i e   of nature  

this paragraph clearly indicates that the sexual organs were worshipped
under the form of khem by the egyptians   the writer  however  has fallen
into a very common error in giving us to understand that this was a degraded
form of worship  from numerous other sources it is readily shown that such
is not the case 

the following lines  from  ancient sex worship   substantiate the above
remarks  and at the same time  they show the incompleteness of the writings
of many antiquarians  in this book we read    phallic emblems abounded at
heliopolis and syria and many other places  even in to modern times  the
following unfolds marvelous proof to our point  a brother physician  writing
to dr  inman  says    i was in egypt last winter  1865 66   and there
certainly are numerous figures of gods and kings on the walls of the temple
at thebes  depicted with the male genital erect   the great temple at karnac
is  in particular  full of such figures and the temple of danclesa 
likewise  although that is of much later date  and built merely in imitation
of old egyptian art     the writer further states that this shows how
completely english egyptologists have suppressed a portion of the facts in
the histories which they have given to the world  with all our descriptions
of the wonderful temple of karnac  it is remarkable that all mention of its
association with sex worship should be omitted by many writers 

a number of travellers in africa  even in comparatively modern times  have
observed evidences of sex worship among the primitive races of that
continent   captain burton 1  speaks of this custom with the dahome tribe
small gods of clay are made in priapic attitudes before which the natives
worship  the god is often made as if contemplating its sexual organs 
another traveler  a clergyman  2  has described the same worship in this
tribe   he has observed idols in priapic attitudes  rudely carved in wood 
and others made of clay  on the lower congo the same worship is described 
where both male and female figures with disproportionate genital organs are
used for purposes of worship   phallic symbols and other offerings are made
to these simple deities 

 1  quoted by h  m  westropp  primitive symbolism

 2  j  w  wood   the uncivilized races 

definite examples of the sexual act having religious significance may be
cited   richard payne knight 3  quotes a passage from captain cook s voyages
to one of the southern pacific islands   the missionaries of the expedition
on this occasion assembled the members of the party for religious ceremonies
in which the natives joined  the primitive natives observed the ceremony
with great respect and then with due solemnity enacted their form of sacred
worship  quite to the astonishment of the white people  this ceremony
consisted of the open performance of the sexual act by a young indian man
and woman  this was entirely a religious ceremony  and was fittingly
respected by all the natives present 

 3  the symbolical language of ancient art and mythology 

hargrave jennings 4  describes the same custom in india   an indian woman of
designated caste and vocation is selected   many incantations and strange
rites are gone through   a circle  or  vacant enchanted place  is rendered
pure by certain rites and sprinkled with wine  then secret charms are
whispered three times in the woman s ear  the sexual act is then
consummated  and the whole procedure before the altar is distinctly a form
of sacrifice and worship 

 4  the roseicrucians 


hoddar m  westropp in  primitive symbolism  has indicated the countries in
which sex worship has existed   he gives numerous instances in ancient
egypt  assyria  greece and rome   in india  as well as in china and japan 
it forms the basis of early religions   this worship is described among the
early races of greece  italy  spain  scandinavia  and among the mexicans and
peruvians of america as well  in borneo  tasmania  and australia phallic
emblems have been found  many other localities have been mentioned by this
writer and one seems fairly justified in concluding that sex worship is
regularly found at one time in the development of primitive races   we shall
now pass to another form of this same worship  namely  sacred prostitution 

sacred prostitution

there is abundant evidence to show that there was a time in the centuries
before christ when prostitution was held as a most sacred vocation   we
learn of this practice from many sources  it appears that temples in a
number of ancient cities of the east  in babylonia  nineveh  corinth and
throughout india  were erected for the worship of certain deities  this
worship consisted of the prostitution of women  the women were consecrated
to the support of the temple  they were chosen in much the same way as the
modern woman enters a sacred church order   the returns from their vocation
went to the support of the deity and the temple  the children born of such a
union were in no way held in disgrace  but on the contrary  they appeared to
have formed a separate and rather superior class   we are told that this
practice did not interfere with a woman s opportunities for subsequent
marriage  in india the practice was very general at one time   the women
were called the  women of the idol    richard payne knight speaks of a
thousand sacred prostitutes living in each of the temples at eryx and
corinth 

a custom which shows even more clearly that prostitution was held as a
sacred duty to women was that in babylonia every woman  of high rank or low 
must at one time in her life prostitute herself to any stranger who offered
money   in  ancient sex worship  we read    there was a temple in babylonia
where every female had to perform once in her life a  to us  strange act of
religion  namely  prostitution with a stranger  the name of it was
bit shagatha  or  the temple   the  place of union     moreover we learn
that once a woman entered the temple for such a sacred act she could not
leave until it was performed 

the above accounts deal exclusively in the sacrifice made by women to the
deity of sex   men did not escape this sacrifice and it appears that some
inflicted upon themselves an even worse one  fraser 5  tells us of this
worship which was introduced from assyria into rome about two hundred years
before christ   it was the worship of cybele and attis   these deities were
attended by emasculated priests and the priests in oriental costume paraded
rome in religious ceremony 

 5  adonis  attis and osiris 

on one occasion  namely   the day of blood  in the spring  the chief
ceremony was held   this  among other things  consisted in fastening an
effigy of the god to a pine tree  which was brought to the temple of the
goddess cybele   a most spectacular dance about the effigy then occurred in
which the priests slashed themselves with knives  the blood being offered as
sacrifice  as the excitement increased the sexual nature of the ceremony
became evident   to quote from fraser   for man after man  his veins
throbbing with the music  his eyes fascinated by the sight of streaming
blood  flung his garments from him  leaped forth with a shout  and seizing
one of the swords which stood ready for the service  castrated himself on
the spot  then he ran through the city holding the bloody parts in his hands
and threw them into one of the houses which he passed in his mad career  

we see that this act directly corresponds with the part played by the
female  the female prostituted herself  and the male presented his
generative powers to the deity   both the sacred prostitutes and emasculated
priests were held in religious veneration 

the above references are sufficient to show that a simple form of sex
worship has been quite generally found   it becomes apparent as we proceed
that the worship of sex not only plays a part  but a very prominent part  in
the developing mind of man  in the frank and open form of this worship it is
quite clear that we are dealing with a very simple type of mind  these
primitive people exhibit many of the qualities of the child  they are quite
without sex consciousness   their motives are at once both simple and
direct  and they are doubtless sincere  much misunderstanding has arisen by
judging such primitive people by the standards of our present day
civilization  sex worship  while it held sway was probably quite as
seriously entertained as many other beliefs  it only became degraded during
a decadent age  when civilization had advanced beyond such simple
conceptions of a deity  but had not evolved a satisfactory substitute 

we shall now pass to a less frank and open deification of sex  namely 
sexual symbolism 

symbolism

as civilization advanced  the deification of sex was no longer frank and
open   it came to be carried on by means of symbolism  this symbolism was an
effort on the part of its originators to express the worship of the
generative attributes under disguise  often understood only by the priests
or by those initiated into the religious mysteries  the mysteries so
frequently referred to in the religions of antiquity are often some
expression of sex worship 

sexual symbolism was very general at one time and remains of it are found in
most of the countries where any form of sex worship has existed  such
remains have been found in egypt  greece  italy  india  china  japan  and
indeed in most countries the early history of which is known to man 

one important kind of symbolism had to do with the form of the object
deified   thus  it appears that certain objects   particularly upright
objects   stones  mounds  poles  trees  etc   were erected  or used as found
in nature  as typifying the male generative organ   likewise certain round
or oval objects  discs  certain fruits and certain natural caves  were
worshipped as representing the female generative organ   the yoni of india  

we also find that certain qualities of animal or vegetable nature were
equally venerated  not because of their form  but because they stood for
some quality desirable in the generation of mankind  thus we find that some
animals  the bull because of its strength and aggressive nature  the snake 
perhaps because of its form or of its tenacity of life   were male
representatives of phallic significance  likewise the fish  the dolphin  and
a number of other aquatic creatures came to be female representatives   this
may be shown over and over again by reference to the antique emblems  coins 
and engravings of many nations 

another later symbolism  which was adopted by certain philosophies  was more
obscure but was none the less of distinct sexual significance  fire is made
to represent the male principle  and water  and much connected with it  the
female   thus we have venus  born of the sea  and accompanied by numerous
fish representations  fire worship was secondary to the universally found
sun worship  the sun is everywhere the male principle  standing for the
generative power in nature   at one time the symbolism is broad  and refers
to generative nature in general  at another time it refers solely to the
human generative organs  thus  the greek god hermes  the god of fecundity in
nature  is at times represented in unmistakable priapic attitudes 

still another symbolism was often used in india   this was the addition of a
number of members to the deity  possibly a number of arms or heads   this
was in order to express a number of qualities  thus the deity was both
generator and destroyer  one face showing benevolence and kindness  the
other violence and rage  in many of the deities both male and female
principles were represented in one   an androgyne deity  which was an ideal
frequently attempted  the idea that these grotesque deities were merely the
expression of eccentricity or caprice on the part of their originator is not
to be entertained   richard payne knight has pointed out that they occur
almost entirely on national coins and emblems  and so were the expression of
an established belief 

we shall refer first to the simpler symbols  that is those in which an
object was deified because of its form 

the upright

it is perhaps not remarkable that upright objects should be selected because
of their form as the simplest expression of phallic ideas  the simple
upright for purposes of sex worship is universally found  an upright conical
stone is frequently mentioned   many of the stone idols or pillars  the
worship of which was forbidden by the bible  come under this group 
likewise  the obelisk  found not only in egypt  but in modified forms in
many other countries as well  embodies the same phallic principle  the usual
explanation of the obelisk is that it represented the rays of the sun
striking the earth   when we speak of sun worship later  we shall see that
this substantiates rather than refutes the phallic interpretation  the
mounds of religious significance  found in many countries  were associated
with sex worship   the chinese pagodas are probably of phallic origin 
indeed  there is evidence to show that the spires of our churches owe their
existence to the uprights or obelisks outside the temples of former ages   a
large volume has been written by o brien to show that the round towers of
ireland  upright towers of pre historic times  were erected as phallic
emblems   higgins  in the anacalipsis  has amassed a great wealth of
material with similar purport  and he shows that such  temples  as that of
stonehenge and others were also phallic  the stone idols of mexico and peru 
the ancient pillar stones of brittany  and in fact all similar upright
objects  erected for religious purposes the world over  are placed in this
same category   we shall presently give a number of references to show that
the may pole was associated with phallic worship and that it originated at a
very remote period 

we shall now quote from some of the authors who have contributed to our
knowledge of this form of symbolism  as thereby a clear idea of their
meaning may be set forth  these interpretations are not generally advanced 
and therefore we have added considerable corroborative evidence which we
have been able to obtain from independent sources 

in an essay on the assyrian  grove  and other emblems  mr  john newton sums
up the basis of this symbolism as follows    as civilization advanced  the
gross symbols of creative power were cast aside  and priestly ingenuity was
taxed to the utmost in inventing a crowd of less obvious emblems  which
should represent the ancient ideas in a decorous manner  the old belief was
retained  but in a mysterious or sublimated form  as symbols of the male  or
active element in creation  the sun  light  fire  a torch  the phallus or
lingam  an erect serpent  a tall straight tree  especially the palm or fir
or pine  were adapted  equally useful for symbolism were a tall upright
stone  menhir   a cone  a pyramid  a thumb or finger pointed straight  a
mask  a rod  a trident  a narrow bottle or amphora  a bow  an arrow  a
lance  a horse  a bull  a lion  and many other animals conspicuous for
masculine power  as symbols of the female  the passive though fruitful
element in creation  the crescent moon  the earth  darkness  water  and its
emblem  a triangle with the apex downward   the yoni   the shallow vessel or
cup for pouring fluid into  cetera   a ring or oval  a lozenge  any narrow
cleft  either natural or artificial  an arch or doorway  were employed   in
the same category of symbols came a boat or ship  a female date palm bearing
fruit  a cow with her calf by her side  a fish  fruits having many seeds 
such as the pomegranate  a shell   concha   a cavern  a garden  a fountain 
a bower  a rose  a fig  and other things of suggestive form  etc 

these two great classes of conventional symbols were often represented in
conjunction with each other  and thus symbolized in the highest degree the
great source of life  ever originating  ever renewed                      a
similar emblem is the lingam standing in the centre of the yoni  the
adoration of which is to this day characteristic of the leading dogma of
hindu religion  there is scarcely a temple in india which has not its
lingam  and in numerous instances this symbol is the only form under which
the god siva is worshipped  

in  ancient sex worship  we read   as the male genital organs were held in
early times to exemplify the actual male creative power  various natural
objects were seized upon to express the theistic idea and at the same time
point to those points of the human form  hence  a similitude is recognized
in a pillar  a heap of stones  a tree between two rocks  a club between two
pine cones  a trident  a thyrsus tied around with two ribbons with the ends
pendant  a thumb and two fingers   the caduceus again the conspicuous part
of the sacred triad ashur is symbolized by a single stone placed
upright   the stump of a tree  a block  a tower  a spire  minaret  pole 
pine  poplar or pine tree  

hargrave jennings  the author of several books on some aspects of religions
of antiquity  among them one on phallicism deals freely with the phallic
principles embodied in these religions  as do many other writers  he
identifies fire worship with sex worship  and the following short paragraph
shows his conception of their interrelationship  as well as the significance
of the upright of antiquity   in the rosicrucians he says   obelisks 
spires  minarets  tall towers  upright stones   menhirs   and architectural
perpendiculars of every description  and  generally speaking  all erections
conspicuous for height and slimness  were representations of the sworded or
of the pyramidal fire   they bespoke  wherever found and in whatever age 
the idea of the first principle or the male generative emblem  

we might readily cite passages from the writings of a number of other
authors but the above paragraphs suffice to set forth the general principle
of this symbolism   as stated above  such interpretations have not been
generally advanced to explain such objects as sacred pillar stones 
obelisks  minarets  etc  it is readily seen how fully these views are
substantiated by observations from a number of independent sources 

in a book of travel 6  in india we are able from an independent source to
learn of the symbolism of that country  the traveller gives a description of
the caves of elephanta  near bombay   these are enormous caves cut in the
side of a mountain  for religious purposes to which pilgrimages are made and
where the usual festivities are held  the worship of generative attributes
is quite apparent  the numerous sculptured female figures  as remarked by
the traveller  are all represented with greatly exaggerated breasts  a
symbolism which is frequent throughout oriental countries for expressing
reproductive attributes 

 6  rousselet  india and its native princes 

in an inner chamber is placed the symbol which is held in particular
veneration   here is found an upright conical stone standing within a
circular one   the stone is sprinkled with water during the festival season 
the writer states that this stone  to the worshippers  represents the male
generative organ  and the worship of it is not considered an impropriety  in
this instance we feel that the symbolism is very definite  and doubtless the
stone pillars in the other temples of india and elsewhere are of the same
significance 

a clergyman in the chinese review of 1876  under the title  phallic worship
in china   gives an account of the phallicism as he observed it at that
time   he states that the male sexual organ is symbolized by a simple mound
of earth and is so worshipped   similarly  the female organ is represented
by a mound of different form and is worshipped as the former  the writer
states that at times these mounds are built in conjunction  he states this
worship is similar to that of baal of chaldea  etc   and that probably all
have a common origin  it appears to be a fundamental part of the chinese
religion and the symbolism of the chinese pagoda expresses the same idea  he
says that kheen or shang te  the chinese deities of sex  are also worshipped
in the form of serpents  of which the dragon of the chinese is a
modification   this furnishes a concrete instance in which the mound of
earth is of phallic significance  and substantiates an interpretation of
serpent worship to which we shall presently refer 

hoddard m  westropp has given us an excellent account of phallic worship and
includes in his description the observations of a traveller in japan at as
late periods as 1864 and 1869 

a temple near the ancient capital of japan was visited by a traveller  in
this temple the main object of worship was a large upright  standing alone 
and the resemblance to the male generative organ was so striking as to leave
no doubt as to what it represented  this upright was worshipped especially
by women  who left votive offerings  among them small phalli  elaborately
wrought out of wood or other material  the traveller remarked that the
worship was most earnest and sincere 

the same traveller observed that in some of the public roads of japan are
small hedged recesses where similar stone pillars are found  these large
pillars unquestionably represent the male organ  the writer has observed
priests in procession carrying similar huge phalli  painted in color as
well   this procession called forth no particular comment and so was
probably not unusual  it is stated that this is a part of the ancient
 shintoo  religion of japan and china   there are frequent references to
certain of the gods of the ancients being represented in priapic attitudes 
the phallus being the prominent and most important attribute  thus hermes 
in greece  was placed at cross roads  with phallus prominent  this was
comparable to the phallus on japanese highways  in the festivals of bacchus
high phalli were carried  the male organ being represented about the size of
the rest of the body  the egyptians carried a gilt phallus  150 cubits high 
at the festivals of osiris   in syria  at the entrance of the temple at
hieropolis  was placed a human figure with a phallus 120 cubits high  a man
mounted this upright twice a year and remained seven days  offering prayers 
etc 

in peru in the temple of the sun an upright pillar has been described
covered with gold leaf  very similar to those existing elsewhere and to
which has been ascribed similar significance 

a number of writers have expressed the belief that the may pole is an emblem
of ancient phallic worship   we know that may day festivals are of the most
remote antiquity   we are indebted to r  p  knight for a description of what
may day was like about four centuries ago in england   the festival started
the evening before  men and women went out into the woods in search of a
tree and brought it back to the village in the early morning  the night was
spent in sexual excesses comparable to those of the roman bacchanalia   a
procession was formed  garlands were added to the may pole  which was set up
in the village square  the puritans referred to it as an idol  and they did
not approve of the festivities   until comparatively recent years there was
a may pole in one of the squares of london  and samuel pepys  7  writing of
his time  speaks of seeing may poles in the front yards of the prominent
citizens of holland   a festival much the same as this was held in ancient
rome and also in india   the may pole properly pierces a disc and thus
conforms with the lingam yoni of india   we also know that the first of may
was a favorite time for all nature worship with the ancients   for a number
of interesting suggestions the reader is referred to r  p  knight  worship
of priapus  and hargrave jennings  indian religions  page 66  

 7  pepys diary 

tree worship is frequently mentioned in the religions of antiquity  we are
told that the mystic powers of the mistletoe comes from the fact that it
grows on the oak  a once sacred tree   the pine of the north  the palm and
the fig tree of the south  were sacred trees at one time  john newton made a
study of tree worship  especially the ancient grove worship of assyria   he
shows that the object of veneration was a male date palm  which represented
the assyrian god baal   sex was worshipped under this deity  and it is shown
that the tree of the assyrian grove was a phallic symbol  palm sunday
appears to be a relic of this worship   in france  until comparatively
recent times  there was a festival   la fete des pinnes   in which palms
were carried in procession  and with the palms were carried phalli of bread
which had been blessed by the priests 

richard payne knight tells us that pan was worshipped by the shepherds under
the form of the tall fir  and bacchus  by sticking up the rude trunk of a
tree    it is shown throughout these pages that sexual attributes were
worshipped under both these deities  in reference to other symbols  the
writer continues  8   the spires and pinnacles with which our churches are
decorated come from these ancient symbols  and the weather cocks  with which
they are surmounted though now only employed to show the direction of the
wind  were originally emblems of the sun  for the cock is the natural herald
of the day  and therefore sacred to the fountain of light   in the
symbolical writings of the chinese the sun is still represented by a cock in
the circle  and a modern parsee would suffer death rather than be guilty of
the crime of killing one   it appears on many ancient coins  with some
symbol of the passive productive power on the reverse  and in other
instances it is united with priapic and other emblems and devices 
signifying other attributes combined  

 8  symbolic language of ancient art and mythology 

dr  thomas inman has made a study to show how this phallic symbolism found
its way into ancient art  and even into some designs of modern times  thus 
many formal designs are studied in which the upright plays a part  likewise 
the oval and the circle receive a similar explanation  the architectural
ornaments spoken of as eggs and anchors  eggs and spear heads  the so called
honey suckle ornament of antiquity  and the origin of some church windows
and ornaments  are all studied by this writer  and his text is accompanied
by illustrations  hargrave jennings has also traced the origin of the
symbols of heraldry  the emblems of royalty and of some church orders with
similar explanations 

we may add that the crux ansata of the egyptians  the oval standing upon the
upright  or letter tau  may be shown to be a sex symbol  the union of the
oval with the upright being of symbolic significance  the crux ansata is
found in the hand of most of the egyptian deities  it is found in the
assyrian temples and throughout the temples of india as well   prehistoric
monuments of ireland have the same design   priests are portrayed in
adoration of the crux ansata before phallic monuments  this symbol  from
which our modern cross is doubtless derived  originated with the religions
of antiquity   much additional evidence could readily be given to illustrate
this prehistoric origin  the present christian symbol affords another
example of the adoption by a new religion of the symbols of the old 

some reflection will show that the origin of many church customs and
symbols  and indeed of a great number of obscure customs and usages  may
quite properly be traced to the religions and practices of primitive races 
lafcadio hearn has insisted upon this in the interpretation of the art and
customs of the japanese   he says  9   art in japan is so intimately
associated with religion that any attempt to study it without extensive
knowledge of the beliefs which it reflects were mere waste of time  by art i
do not mean painting and sculpture but every kind of decoration  and most
kinds of pictorial representation  the image of a boy s kite or a girl s
battledore not less than the design upon a lacquered casquet or enameled
vase   the figure upon a workman s trowel not less than the pattern of the
girdle of a princess   the shape of the paper doll or wooden rattle bought
for a baby  not less than the forms of those colossal ni o who guard the
gateways of the buddha s temples   etc 

 9  japan  an attempt at interpretation 

in the above pages  we have given an account of the views of a number of
writers upon certain forms and symbols  and at the same time we have offered
considerable evidence in substantiation from independent sources   these
origins  found associated especially in art and religious usages  have not
been generally understood   yet when we reflect upon the fact that many
religious customs are of great antiquity  that when once a certain form or
custom becomes established  it is well nigh ineffaceable  although subject
to great change or disguise throughout the centuries  when we reflect upon
these conditions  and realize the fact that sex worship with its
accompanying symbolism is found throughout primitive religions  we may then
more readily appreciate the entire significance of the above
interpretations 

it must  of course  be borne in mind that no one now gives these
interpretations to spires  minarets  and to the various monumental symbols
of which we have been speaking  we are here dealing exclusively with
pre historic origins  not with present day meanings   the antiquity of
certain symbols is truly remarkable   the star and crescent  for example  a
well known conventionalized symbol  is found on assyrian cylinders 
doubtless devised many centuries before christ 

the full force and meaning of these various symbols may be very readily
grasped by reference to a number of designs  ancient coins  bas reliefs 
monuments  etc   which have been reproduced in plates and drawings by c  w 
king  thomas inman  r  p  knight and others  to these we refer the reader

the psychoanalytic treatment of hystero epilepsy

by l  e  emerson  ph  d 

psychologist  massachusetts general hospital  examiner in psychotherapy 
psychopathic hospital  boston  massachusetts  assistant in neurology 
graduate school of medicine  harvard university 

when a new method of working in any field of endeavor is devised  or a new
point of view is discovered  it is natural to turn to other similar fields
to see if the method will work there  this is what is done when one
approaches the study of epilepsy from the point of view of psychoanalysis 

it is not my purpose to undertake an exhaustive psychoanalytic study of
epilepsy   neither is it my purpose to enter into a discussion of the
problems of differential diagnosis  it has already been shown  in borderland
cases  that one cannot tell the difference between epilepsy and hysteria 
without a prolonged psychoanalysis  and even then one cannot be certain 
this suggests that the whole thing is more or less a matter of definition 
into such questions i cannot enter   my aim is much more modest  the
immediate purpose of my paper is to study some of the problems of therapy 
from the psychoanalytic point of view  of that small class of patients on
the borderline between hysteria and epilepsy  or patients with epileptiform
attacks 

the first publication of studies of this general nature was made by dr 
james j  putnam and dr  george a  waterman in the boston medical and
surgical journal for may  1905  under the title  certain aspects of the
differential diagnosis between epilepsy and hysteria    in this paper the
authors say   no one  so far as we are aware  has as yet studied with
sufficient thoroughness the subconscious memories of epileptics  and for all
we now can say  closer resemblances may be found between these and the
subconscious states of the hysterics than we now imagine    p  513 

in this paper  however  therapy is only hinted at 

a contribution to our insight as to the epileptic state of mind is made by
jung  under the title   analyse der assoziationen eines epileptikers   in
his   diagnostische assoziationsstudien   beitrage zur experimentellen
psychopathologie    p  175  1906  

he found an extraordinary number of emotionally toned  egocentric relations 
there were some signs to suggest that the emotional tone in the epileptic
was unusually lasting 

the first thing published on epilepsy avowedly from the psychoanalytic
view point was by maeder    sexualitat und epilepsy    jahrbuch bi hi  1909 

maeder goes into the subject rather exhaustively  after characteristic
german fashion  but his conclusions are comparatively simple  he says   the
sexuality of the epileptic is characterized by the prominence of auto  and
allo erotism  it retains much of the infantile form  but has undergone 
nevertheless  a certain development  which i designate as  sexual
polyvalence    for some unknown reason the libido seems to have an abnormal
intensity    p  154 

this is an important contribution to our knowledge of the psychic state of
epileptics but it is notable that not a word is said as to therapy 

sadger published the same year   ein fall von pseudoepilepsia hysterica
psychoanalytisch erklart     wiener klein  rundschau  p  212  1909   but
neither does he have anything to say about therapy 

dr  wilhelm stekel  however  treats the problem from the therapeutic point
of view in   die psychische behandlung der epilepsie     zentralblatt fur
psychoanalyse p  220 no  5 6  vol  1  

the essential kernel of stekel s view is that the epileptic is a repressed
criminal   the convulsion is a substitute for the criminal act   he
announces categorically that pseudoepilepsy is curable by psychoanalytic
procedures  of three cases which he completely analysed  two were cured  his
final conclusion is fourfold    1  epilepsy  more often than we have
hitherto thought  is of psychogenic origin   2  in all cases there is a
strong tendency to criminality which is unbearable to consciousness    3 
the attack is a substitute for an offense  hence  eventually a sexual
offense   4  pseudo epilepsy is curable by psychoanalysis 

spratling calls attention  to the value of an occasional convulsion in
certain cases   in some patients the fit acts as a safety valve that
unquestionably permits escape from insanity      in many cases the
convulsion seems t o come as the termination of an obscure  auto toxic 
cycle which varies in duration in different individuals and bears some
relationship to the ascending period of the folie circulaire of the french 
it seems that the specific cause of the fit in these cases is something that
permeates the entire organism  something that comes and goes  that grows
rapidly in intensity  exerting a pernicious influence on the patient by
making him act out of harmony with his normal state  until the limit is
reached and the mind loses its direction and control  the power of
inhibition being finally destroyed  the nervous storm breaks with great
force and violence    p  361 

although spratling had in mind a toxic agent  one cannot but be struck with
how completely his terms describe an emotional outburst 

in a paper read in boston last winter  dr  l  pierce clark advanced the view
that the epilpetic seizure was the symbolical expression of the desire of
the patient to return to the mutterleib  the convulsive moments were such
reflect and random acts as one sees in infants or infers in the embryo 
regard for social sanctions is lost   this  of course  suggests the first
step in criminality  clark found that favorable cases were amenable to
psychic treatment and said that some cases had been very much helped by
psychoanalysis  i am not certain whether he claims to have cured any
particular case of pseudo epilepsy or epileptiform attacks  by
psychoanalysis  in presenting some of my own cases let me begin with one
that certainly was not a complete success  but nevertheless was much helped
by psychoanalysis 

this case is that of a young girl  aged 14  without known inherited
tendency  her first attacks had occurred about a year previous in the form
of fainting spells   these were afterwards followed by convulsions  in
convulsions the patient thrashed about  kicking her legs and clawing at her
chest   these convulsive movements stopped after a while and were followed
by a deep sleep  after which the patient awoke without any memory of what
had happened 

it was found that during the convulsion the patient imagined she was being
pursued by a black faced figure with claw like hands  of a peculiar shape
like her father s 

further investigation showed that her father got drunk and did chase her 
sometimes kicking her out of the house  she would undress her father
sometimes and put him to bed  once when taking off his shoes he kicked her 
as she was bending over him  in the lower part of the abdomen  this was just
before the convulsions developed   the fainting spells occurred soon after
she had first seen her father naked  the image of his nakedness so
distressed her by continually coming before her mind that she made the most
desperate efforts to repress it  finally partially succeeding  speaking of
her father she said   every time i think of him i feel like taking a fit 
oh   it makes me feel terrible  

her father had kicked her in the chest  too  which perhaps partially
accounts for the clawing 

in the light of this knowledge the convulsive movements become a little more
comprehensible   they are futile attempts to run away  they are the partial
movements of flight 

the cries that sometimes initiated and accompanied the convulsions at first 
afterwards became sufficiently articulate to be understood as calls  mama 
mama  mama  

it was found that when her father would chase her about the house  in
drunken fury  she would call for her mother in frantic fear  here 
apparently  is a meaning of the call preceding the convulsions 

under a very short psychoanalytic treatment the patient showed marked
improvement   her attacks became much less violent and much farther apart 
she became able to control them to a great extent  finally she became so
well that one might say she had practically recovered 

apparently there is no hint here of a repressed criminal complex  but a
little deeper analysis suggests it  however   the first attack  which was in
the form of a faint  occurred under the following circumstances  the patient
was at the funeral of the father of her best girl friend  as she looked at
the dead body of her friend s father the thought flashed through her mind 
 he was so good  and now he is dead  while my father who is so bad  still
lives   i wish he were dead   shortly after she fainted 

there were a number of reasons  seemingly adequate  for incomplete success
in this case   in the first place  the patient had been in this country only
a few years and spoke very broken english   she is a russian jew   obviously
this was a very great barrier to understanding  in the next place it was
almost impossible to change conditions of home  although social service
worked wonders in this case  the father continued to get drunk  and one of
the last of her now infrequent attacks occurred on his return from jail  the
patient was dreadfully afraid lest her father find out that the knowledge of
his delinquency had been discovered through her 

not the least of the reasons militating against complete success was the
short time possible for psychoanalytic treatment  the patient was seen only
three weeks   as the time needed for a psychoanalysis is variable depending
on the particular patient  it is clear that this would be too short a time
to enable a young girl  only recently here from russia  to understand  or to
overcome resistances  that the treatment was as nearly successful as it was
is perhaps encouraging to the hope that suitable cases under favorable
conditions might be cured 

the next case is one where the diagnosis lay between hysteria and epilepsy 
the symptoms were as follows  the patient had attacks in which she became
unconscious  gasped  and spittle ran from her mouth   she also bit her
tongue  she becomes stiff  eyes stark  and is left tired and weak  these
attacks were first noticed about five years ago  since then she has had
about five similar attacks  the last three coming within five months   the
last two were within a day of each other and frightened her so she came to
the hospital  at the age of eight or nine she said that she had flashes of
speechlessness  and a thought which she cannot define  as of a horse or a
man   she never became unconscious or bit her tongue  after her first
catamenial these flashes of speechlessness and thought came only at this
time   at the age of two the patient said that she had fallen down stairs
and hit her head  she said she was unconscious twenty four hours 

as a result of a psychoanalysis the following facts were learned  the
patient was a very sensitive child  exceedingly responsive to her
environment   she was also stubborn and self willed  at times  she was
reserved and capable of great repression   when she was about three or four
she remembers seeing in the bible a picture of the devil on a white horse 
this used to make her shudder  but it also had a sort of irresistible
fascination   later  when she was seven or eight  it would come into her
mind in school even and make her feel so badly she would lay her head on her
arms   but she never told anybody what it was that troubled her and she
would put it out of her mind  she thoroughly believed her mother when she
told her that the devil would come and get her if she did wrong 

at about the age of ten or eleven she began going with a girl much older
than herself   she used to visit this girl and spend the night with her  and
in turn have her at her own home  in this way they spent the night together
quite frequently  soon the girl wanted to masturbate her and although she
repelled her advances at first she finally allowed it because she was told
she would be regarded as queer if she didn t as other girls did it and liked
it   she  however  never did get any pleasure out of the practice  and
remained perfectly passive  she thought if her friend enjoyed it and it
didn t hurt her she should let her have her pleasure   she never told of
this 

the patient now began having what she called staring spells  these never
lasted more than a second or so and they were never observed  she carefully
concealed them   just before the patient began to menstruate which was when
she was about fourteen  she noticed that the day after she had been with the
girl who masturbated her she had a terrific headache  then she remembered
that for a long time it had been so though she had never connected the
headaches before with the masturbation  she stopped the practice immediately
and never allowed it to be resumed 

after menstruation began the staring spells became grouped and came only
during her periods   but they were more numerous  she would have a number in
one day   they were not yet sufficiently observable to be noticed   at about
this time she had a terrible fright  she was kneeling at her mother s side
listening to a story when she thought she saw a woman s face looking at her
over her mother s shoulder  she was speechless with terror   this was not
noticed and she did not tell  around this time too she had another fright 
she was studying one evening at the dining room table when she saw a face
looking in at the window   she screamed  and kept on screaming  but finally
was able to tell that she had seen someone looking in at the window  her
father took her out and showed that it couldn t be so because there were no
tracks in the snow which was on the ground   she wouldn t or couldn t stop
crying  however  and kept it up all night  she said  just before
menstruation she did some sleep walking  she got up one night and went to
her mother and said she had something to tell her  her mother tried to get
her to say what it was but could not  and saw that her daughter was asleep 
she kept saying   you know what it is   the mother did not dare to waken her
and finally got her quietly back into bed   the next morning she remembered
nothing of what had happened 

when the patient was about sixteen she married   her husband did not want
any children and practiced coitus interruptus  but she became pregnant
nevertheless and had an abortion performed   although c i  continued to be
practiced she became pregnant again and this time she had a daughter  four
more years of c  i  followed   during all this time the patient had the
staring spells  but they were never noticed and she never told  not even her
mother   then  like a thunder bolt out of a clear sky  came a tragedy 

she was pregnant again  and visiting her mother  expecting her husband for
over sunday  when she received a letter saying he had left her and had gone
off with another woman  when she read the letter she lost consciousness 

then followed a terrible time   in hate of her husband and on account of
fear lest she be unable to care for her baby she had another abortion
performed  this time she nearly died through not having proper medical
attendance afterwards  but she finally recovered and lived a life of
feverish activity and hate 

during her marriage she had been entirely frigid with respect to the sexual
act   a friend told her she had been missing an essential experience of
marriage   about a year after her husband left her she met a man who
thrilled her through and through  and thought   this is what my friend
meant    this man showed her some attention and she set out consciously to
seduce him  she soon succeeded and though he was wildly in love with her and
wanted to marry her  she steadfastly refused on the score of not loving him 
but was his mistress for two or three years  during this time her staring
spells seem to have been at a minimum  but i cannot assert that they
disappeared 

then she met the man who became her second husband  she had refused to marry
her lover because she did not  love  him  she now dropped him completely 
and getting a divorce from her husband on the ground of desertion  married 

she was happy about a year and a half when her husband moved to a country
cross road near a  hotel   bar room   here he began drinking badly  and
consorting with prostitutes  for three years she fought her husband off  in
fear of infection  during this time she had no intercourse   at this time
began the attacks of unconsciousness   she was alone one night  while her
husband was off carousing  when she had a terrible fright on seeing a man
trying to get in at the window  this was probably hallucinatory as nothing
came of it  but from this time forth she was subject to attacks  in which
she lost consciousness  had convulsions  frothed at the mouth  and bit her
tongue badly 

at the end of about three years  however  her patience broke  and she told
her husband that if he did not stop she should leave him  this threat
brought him to his senses apparently  and he completely reformed  but her
love for him was dead   and though she now permitted marital relations to be
resumed  she remained from this time on absolutely frigid  her husband too 
now suffered from premature ejaculation   thus from the point of view both
of  passion  and of  love  the patient was not satisfied  her attacks
increased in number and violence  coming now at any time  not being confined
to the menstrual period as at first  and coming days as well as nights 

in this patient we have represented the points of view both of stekel and of
clark   the patient showed conclusively her capacity for criminal action 
she also illustrates the craving for a return to the mother  the morning of
the day on which she had the first attack in which she bit her tongue  she
passed through the town where her mother was living and thought   oh  if i
could only go to my mother    but remembering she had promised her lawyer to
live a year with her husband  she went on  of the sexual character of her
conflicts no further comment is necessary 

here then we have the natural history of what  hysteria  or epilepsy   this
question i shall not attempt to answer  but what has been the therapeutic
result of psychoanalysis  this question i can answer 

in the six months during which the analysis has been in progress the patient
has had no attacks in which she has had convulsions  frothed at the mouth 
or bitten her tongue  she has had only three spells in which consciousness
was lost and these were mild   the last one was described by the daughter 
she said it was like a faint  that her mother was in it only a short time 
that she had none of the symptoms she used to have  and was all right soon
afterwards with no bad after effects  she added that since her mother had
been coming to the hospital she had improved so much they never thought of
her now as being sick  the bad feelings have diminished so much in number
and intensity as to be almost negligible   family relations have so improved
husband and wife are practically at one in their purposes  social relations
have also improved to such an extent that the patient has been able to
prevent the wreck of the home of a friend  and in her church is an active
worker on a number of committees  she is now doing her best to get her
daughter started right in life  the patient regards herself as having
practically recovered 

the next case i wish to present for your consideration is that of a young
man twenty six years old   he was brought into the accident room of the
hospital one night last summer suffering from convulsions  he continued to
have convulsions throughout the night  and as many as five interns were
required to hold him quiet  these convulsions seemed to have enough purpose
in them to warrant the diagnosis of hysteria  so the next morning he was
referred to me 

 last wednesday night   he said   i was having dinner with a customer at the
hotel thorndike   i began to feel sick and went to the toilet and vomited 
then i went back and got my friend and started for a drug store in park
square to get some quinine  but before i got very far i began to shiver and
shake and i knew that it took quinine two or three hours to work so i
started back to the hotel to get a room   no rooms were to be had  so i said
 get a taxi and take me to the hospital   i lost the use of my legs on the
steps and they had to carry me  in this attack i was more or less conscious
all through it   what were you thinking of in the taxi  i asked    i don t
know  i felt as if i wanted to jump at something and grab something   can
you not remember what was in your mind  i continued   only what i ve told
you   he answered   will you lie down and close your eyes and imagine
yourself back in the taxi  i asked  now tell me what you see   after a
moment he said   i see flames   what else do you see    nothing  only
flames   i feel as if i wanted to jump into the fire    did you see flames
in the taxi  i asked    yes  that was what i wanted to jump at   at this
moment the patient gave a start   what did you see then  i asked    there is
something in the flames  an object  i don t know what it is   it might be a
thing or a person  i feel as if i wanted to grab the object    at this
instant the patient gave a violent jump into the air and then sank back
relaxed   what did you see  i asked    this object  it seemed to be
attracting me    can t you tell what it is  i said   no  but it seems almost
like a person   it seems as if i could see an arm    what else do you see 
 the arms seem beckoning me   it is a person then   is it a man or a woman 
 i don t know  i can t make out    look    it is a woman   i can see now  
is it anybody you know    no  i can t see any face   what do you see    just
a woman  standing in the flames  with outstretched arms  as if imploring me
to come  i feel a yearning  as if i must jump and grab her   the patient
stiffened slightly and gave a sort of spring up from the couch and then sank
back  breathing a little heavier  what did you see  i asked    i thought she
beckoned me to come   can you see who it is now    no the face is blank  
look again and see if you can t tell who it is   what do you see   i can t
tell   i see several faces come and go   do you recognize them    yes   the
first is my little girl s  then i see a former sweetheart of mine  then i
see my wife s face  

gradually the following story was elicited from the patient  his mother died
when he was seven and his father married again in less than a year   the
former sweetheart was his step mother s half sister who came to live at
their house because the schools were better  he became infatuated with this
girl and his step mother did everything she could to encourage his feeling
as she thought it would be a good match  the vision of his sweetheart in the
flames was based on an actual occurrence  she was sitting in front of a
fireplace once when a log of burning wood fell out and he jumped to pull her
away and held her close in his arms for a moment 

finally  however  he broke off absolutely all relations with the girl  the
reason seems quite adequate   why didn t you marry  i asked  he answered 
 we quarrelled and i left her   i didn t like her morals  she went with
other men and had connection with them  i saw her go into the woods one
night with another fellow  and once at salisbury beach i saw her go into a
hotel with a man and register as his wife  

about a year after this the patient began going with another girl more in an
attempt to crowd the image of his former first love out of his mind than
because he had fallen in love again   a year later they married   from the
first his married life was not entirely happy  more or less unconsciously he
began to regret lost opportunities  he was a travelling man and soon after
marriage his route was enlarged necessitating his being away from home a
month at a time  on these trips he used to get exceedingly lonesome
especially as he steadily refused going with other travelling men and making
a night of it as they often did   one of his routes took him to virginia and
he said that he had returned from new york on the way there just for the
sake of spending a night with his wife   once  in new york  he was
unfaithful to his wife and on that occasion contracted gonorrhea  this 
however  was the only time he has ever had extra marital sexual relations 
he said 

just before his attacks began  which was about four years ago  he was told
by his wife s doctor that it would be impossible for her to have any more
children as she was suffering from heart disease  to his mind this meant
giving up coitus   then  unconsciously  he began to dream of anna  his first
love   he regretted more than ever not taking advantage of his former
opportunities  and unconsciously dallied with the thought of deserting his
wife  just at this time his attacks began 

as the analysis progressed his attacks diminished and shortly disappeared 
gradually the image of his wife took full possession of his mind and the
image of anna disappeared  towards the end of the analysis as he was lying
on the couch with his eyes shut  he saw anna in the flames and felt the
yearning but not so strongly as to lead to any impulsive movements  what do
you think all this might mean  i asked   i don t know   he answered   it
might mean i still cared for anna and that if i let myself go it would break
up my home   with his full realization of the meaning of this symbolization 
it was assumed that he was cured 

seven months later  in company with a colleague  i visited my former patient
and he told me that he had not had a moment s illness since i last saw him 
he told me that while occasionally the thought of anna would come to his
mind  it never disturbed him  and never distracted his attention from other
things  he has prospered in his business  and i saw every evidence of a
happy home 

this case merits consideration for a number of reasons  in the first place
the attacks were cured by psychoanalysis  no one who saw the association of
the symbolical imagery and the convulsive movements could fail to see that
there was a causal connection between them   the subsidence in violence and
frequency of the convulsive movements as the conscious grasp of the meaning
of the mental symbolical imagery increased was also completely convincing of
the therapeutic value of the analysis  the question of the permanence of the
recovery is of course open  because seven months is far too short a time to
carry complete conviction 

the comparison of this case with the one immediately preceding raises a very
interesting question   why is this patient apparently completely cured and
the other one not  several reasons may be noted   the patient is much
younger  he had never been through anything like the same mental strains 
his trouble was of short duration   but above all as he was successful in
his business he was successful in his sublimation  here is a sine qua non of
a successful psychoanalysis  the capacity and the opportunity for successful
sublimation  if these are present the prognosis is good 

it is interesting also to compare this case in its results with the
contentions of clark and of stekel   it is hard to see any signs of a
definite criminal tendency   inasmuch as the temptation to go back to his
early love is a sign of a tendency towards regression and erotism generally
the patient shows what clark has spoken of as a desire to return to the
mother body  this case is not very important  however  to the views of
either clark or stekel as the analysis is relatively superficial  and there
is no knowing what a more thorough analysis might reveal  from the point of
view of superficiality  however  the case is important as it emphasizes
taylor s view of the value of a modified analysis  the patient was seen only
five times 

on the basis of these  and a number of other similar cases  i should like to
suggest  from a descriptive point of view  that the epileptiform seizure is
of the nature of an orgasm  an orgasm is a sudden  explosive  discharge of
nervous energy  raised to the breaking point of nervous tension  i should
like to generalize the idea of orgasm  ordinarily  of course  it is confined
to the sexual sphere  in the last case i reported it seems to me fairly
clear that the explosive actions  convulsive like impulses  were closely
associated in the mind of the patient with sexual ideas  that they were
substitutes for the normal relief of sexual tension  seems to me also clear 
this idea is perhaps more convincing if i add the fact  as stated by the
patient  that his last attack started when he saw an attractive girl sitting
at a nearby table in the thorndike hotel  and who started him dreaming about
anna  because she looked so much like her 

the second case i reported seems also easily brought under this conception 
here we know more about the earliest childhood of the patient and we can
easily imagine that there was an especial predisposition for the form the
symptoms took   this  however  does not militate against the descriptive
value of the above conception   that the epileptiform attacks did not take
place until after actual sexual orgasms had been experienced  lends weight
to the conception i am presenting here   the first case is not so clear 
this is partly due to the fact that it was impossible to make anything like
a complete analysis   but it shows nothing contradictory to the conception 
and indeed has some slight value as added evidence in favor of the
conception  in as much as the original trauma consisted of a kick in the
genitals  by her father 

this conception does not contradict either stekel s or clark s ideas  but
rather supplements them   the essence of the criminal act lies in its
unrestrained aggressive character   from this point of view anything getting
in the way of the libido discharge has to take the consequences  this also
agrees with clark  only his idea seems to me perhaps a little too passive to
describe fully the dynamic quality of the attack 

here  as in hysteria  the therapeutic effect of an analysis depends on the
possibility of sublimation   the three cases i have given in some detail may
easily be arranged in order  the last case having the best chances for
sublimation shows the best results 



on the genesis and the meaning of tics

by meyer solomon  m  d 

associate in neurology  maimonides hospital  chicago

the problem of the genesis and meaning of the strange manifestations which
we find in that peculiar disorder which goes by the accepted name of tics is
indeed difficult of solution   the analytic and genetic standpoint only
comparatively recently assumed in the domain of neurology and psychiatry is
having an ever wider and wider application  the problems in neurology and
psychiatry which still cry loudly for solution and rational explanation are
indeed numerous  some of these questions are so baffling that at times they
seem almost beyond the ken of the human mind   nevertheless  with
persistence and the  don t give up the ship  spirit keenly imbued into us 
and with that irrepressible spirit of investigation and of research born of
optimism and of curiosity  we may expect to see many of these problems which
now seem to us so hopelessly unsolvable gradually rescued from the uncertain
waters of speculation and theorization and brought to the more sound shores
and land of the knowable and the known  if our theories be but tinctured
with due admixture of that sound self criticism that comes of prolonged and
serious reflection and deliberation  and if the results of observation and
investigation be brought forth in support of these theories  then we need
have no hesitancy in permitting freedom in theorization and speculation  let
us also remember that unsound theories or standpoints do not come to stay 
but  after surviving for a certain time  give way before that which is more
sound  more tangible  more near the truth  which  to be sure  is always but
approximately attained  if  therefore  the theory which i intend to set
before you for consideration may seem on first thought far fetched and
unsupported  i beg you to remember that in a field where but comparatively
little is known with absolute certainty  it behooves us to take notice of
all theories or conclusions which may be propounded  since  even though they
may not contain the whole truth  they may  perhaps  contain certain germs of
truth  which may contribute  in some measure  however slight  toward the
ultimate solution of the problem under consideration 

with these brief prefatory remarks  i shall forthwith enter into the
discussion of the genesis and meaning of the tics 

i may say at once that this is not merely a theoretical and purely academic
proposition which has no practical bearings in the way of prognosis and
treatment   on the other hand  a real understanding of the nature  origin 
and significance of the tics is of decided value in giving us proper
standpoints and orientation with respect to the prevention  prognosis and
cure of the condition 

i need not enter into a description of the characteristics of tics in this
place   i may merely mention that tics have two aspects  a psychic and a
physical   it is  in other words  a psychoneurosis  the characteristic
mental state is one of doubt  of indecision  of inadequacy  of restlessness 
of tension  of discomfort and of dissatisfaction  which is more or less
unappeasable and irrepressible and uncontrollable until it finds vent in a
rather explosive series of motor expressions which  as it were  are the
safety valve for the peculiar feeling of tension and discomfort which the
individual has been experiencing and which is accompanied by a sense of
relief  satisfaction and a relative degree of comfort and mental rest   the
mental imperfection  charcot  of the ticquer is a polymorphic psychic defect
 brissaud  meige and feindel  characterized by mental infantilism  for
ticquers  like other psychoneurotics  are like big children  they have the
mind of children  in respect to the emotional make up 

the mental condition of ticquers is especially characterized by the
imperfection or weakness of volition  by a certain degree of mental
instability and lack of inhibitory control of the desires  tendencies 
activities and motor expressions of the individual  this defect laying the
groundwork for the impulsions and obsessions  as also for hysterical 
so called neurasthenic  hypochondriacal  depressive and so called dementia
praecox reactions   the tic movement is the symbol of the psychic defect or
degeneration or instability 

the earlier investigators were responsible for the differentiation of the
tics from such other conditions as sydenham s chorea  huntington s chorea 
the spasms  the stereotypies  the habit movements  the myoclonias  and other
allied conditions   it is due to their pioneer work that tics were
recognized as a definite and distinct clinical entity  the process of
disintegration of these various movements and their differentiation one from
the other cannot be overvalued   among those who have contributed most to
this subject may be mentioned magnan and his pupils  especially saury and
legrain  gilles de la tourette  letulle  guinon noir  pitres  cruchet 
grasset  trousseau  charcot  brissaud meige and feindel   although trousseau
recognized the the ticquer was mentally abnormal  it was charcot who first
called definite attention to the psychic origin of the condition and to the
fact that tic was indeed a mental disorder  a psychoneurosis  a psychomotor
reaction  his lead was subsequently followed up by brissaud  and by the
latter s pupils meige and feindel  the latter two authors giving us a
comprehensive discussion of the subject in their well known classic   1 more
recently the freudian school has attempted to dig down into the roots of the
tree which ultimately sends forth its branches in the guise of tics

views of the french school

the usual conception of tics  as laid down by brissaud  meige and
feindel  1  may be stated as follows   tic movements are physiological acts
which were originally functional and purposeful in character  but which have
become habits  apparently purposeless and meaningless  the motor reaction is
the result of some external stimulus or idea  normal or abnormal  or both 
which originally was necessary for the production of the tic movement  which
latter eventually became habitual and automatic  and  owing to repetition 
was executed  even in the absence of the external stimulus or idea  without
apparent purpose or meaning  at first but little more than purposive habit
movements  they finally became irrepressible acts which sought for
expression  which were but little under the control of the will  which
occurred in attacks varying in frequency  duration and severity  which
decreased under distraction and generally ceased during sleep  which were
increased in frequency and duration and severity by fatigue  emotional
upset  mental unrest  conflict and strain  while the lack of inhibition and
will power  the lack of self control was the dominant mental state  leading
to feelings of insufficiency  doubt  indecision and incapacity  and making
the ground work for the psychasthenic reactions in the form of morbid
impulses and obsessions  and for the hysterical  so called neurasthenic and
other morbid psychic trends 

the inherent or acquired neuropathic and psychopathic state is the basic
condition which prepares the subsoil 

from a consideration of the motor symptom we may say that it is but a
pathological habit  which  however  is apt to lead to the tendency toward or
generation of an increasing number of such pathological habits 

characteristic of tics we may mention their being conscious before and after
but not during their execution  their being disordered functional acts 
their impetuous  irresistible demand for execution  the antecedent desire 
and the subsequent satisfaction 

the etiology of tics  as laid down by meige and feindel  may be summed up by
stating that they occur most frequently in young subjects  less frequently
in savages and animals than in the civilized  there is a psychic
predisposition based on heredity  of a similar or dissimilar neuropathy or
psychopathy  upon which charcot laid great stress  imitation  especially in
the young  plays a role  as also brain fatigue  emotion  mental upset and
worry  and indolence  with the frequent exciting cause of an external or
internal stimulus or an idea  which is the explanation of the origin 
source  situation and form of the tic or tics present in any particular
case 

scattered references to emotional shock acting as a possible exciting cause
of tics  as at times of obsessions  can be found in the literature  dupre 2 
has made such reference   meige and   feindel 3  themselves make the
statement that  fear may elicit a movement of defense  to persist as a tic
after the exciting cause has vanished   they also state that  in ticquers
the impulse to seek a sensation is common and also to repeat to excess a
functional act

page 54  of the english translation  reference 1  

 3  loc   cit   p  62 

bresler 4  has called attention to the fact that the movements are in the
nature of defensive and protective movements of expression and mimicry and
originally in reaction to some external irritant or as the result of some
idea  and he proposed the name  mimische krampfneurose  for them  this is
somewhat allied to breuer and freud s theory of hysteria 

 4  quoted by meige and feindel  loc  cit   p  267 

the object of tic is some imaginary end  the influence of the will always
being present in the beginning  although later it may be absent  tics are of
cortical origin  being coordinated and synergic  clonic or at times tonic   
muscular movements  physiologically and not anatomically grouped 
premeditated  purposive  of abnormal intensity  apparently causeless and
inopportune 

    cruchet objects to calling these tonic reactions tics 

insufficiency of inhibition is the cause of the beginning and of the
persistence of bad habits and of tics 

tic is a sign of degeneration  in the biological and evolutionary sense  a
degenerative neuropathic and psychopathic basis  as mentioned previously 
being present  although often latent 

the maladie des tics is but the extreme form 

the onset is as a rule insidious  with a tendency to spread 

spontaneous cures may occur  while gilles de la tourette s disease is but
the extreme form of a condition in which antagonistic gestures are
frequently adopted by the patient to adapt himself and to get to a state of
rest 

this  as i see the situation  is as far as the french students of this
subject  including brissaud  meige and feindel  and even janet  have
permitted themselves to go   and  in my opinion  their observations and
conclusions seem to be quite accurate 



views of the freudian school

recently the freudian school has endeavored to penetrate more deeply to the
nucleus of the problem and to solve it  freud has delimited what he calls
obsessional or compulsion neurosis  zwangsneurosis   which is classed under
psychasthenia by the french and under neurasthenia by others   the freudians
regard this as a distinct neurosis  sometimes complicated by neurasthenic or
hysterical symptoms  the characteristic symptom is a feeling of compulsion 
the symptoms may be motor  obsessional acts  impulsions   sensory
 obsessional hallucinations or sensations   ideational  obsessions   and
affective  obsessive emotions  particularly doubt and fear   in this
condition we find that there is an excessive psychical significance attached
to certain thoughts  obsessions are characterized by dissociations from the
main personality   they thus exist in the unconsciousness  the original
unconscious mental processes have brought about  by displacement  an excess
of psychical significance to these thoughts  ernest jones 5  states that
freud found  by his work in psychoanalysis  that obsessions represented 
symbolically  the return of self reproaches of ancient  infantile and early
childhood origin  which had been repressed and buried until the obsession
made its appearance   they always refer to active sexual performances or
tendencies   and  as jones further explains   there occurs early in life an
exaggerated divorce between the instincts of hate and love  and the conflict
and antagonism between the two dominate the most important reactions of the
person   a fundamental state of doubt  an incapacity for decision  results
from this paralyzing doubt  the patient oscillates between the two
conditions of not being able to act  when he wants to   and of being obliged
to act  when he doesn t want to   the symptom symbolizes the conflicting
forces  these are not  as in hysteria  fused into a compromise formation 
but come to separate and alternating expression  one set of manifestations 
therefore  symbolizes the repressed forces  another the repressing  

 5  see his article on  the treatment of the psychoneuroses   white and
jelliffe s modern treatment of nervous and mental diseases  vol i  pp 
408 409 

to put the matter plainly  the freudians contend that obsessions are
symbolical representations of the repressed sexual activities and tendencies
of infantile and early childhood origin  it must be remembered that the
freudians employ the term sexual in a very broad sense  including under it
the most indirect and distant physical  mental and moral reverbations 
conscious or  unconscious   of the relations between the sexes  the sexual
impulse is here conceived of as having incestuous  bisexual and polymorphous
perverse sexual tendencies  the word sexual is not only used as synonymous
with love  but practically all emotional surgings  all feelings  all
affectivity  all sense cravings and bodily heavings are classed by certain
members of the freudian school as sexual  this latter interpretation and
extension of the connotation generally accorded by us to the term sexual we
surely have no right to give it 

clark  of new york city  is the author who has carried out the freudian idea
to its ultimate conclusion  i refer to his series of three papers 6  in the
medical record  and call particular attention to his last  third  paper in
which he has fully elaborated his theory of the meaning of tics    

 6  his three papers  which appeared in the medical record  new york  in the
issues of february 7 and 8  and march 8 1914  are entitled   1   some
observations upon the etiology of mental torticollis    2   a further study
upon mental torticollis as a psychoneurosis   and  3   remarks upon mental
infantilism in the tic neurosis    a fourth paper by clark on tics appeared
in the medical record of january 30  1915 

    j  sadger has also come to similar conclusions 

clark s conception of the meaning of tic movements and of the mental state
characteristic of ticquers must be here given  although not denying the
basic neurotic constitution present in ticquers  clark sums up by giving the
following definite and fully developed theory 

 the ticquer has a strong sexual attachment  this is so strong that the love
instinct ineffectually sublimates the hate instinct and in the warring
conflict doubt and physical and psychic inadequacy arise  the situation
continues and generates mental  and physical infantilism  which in turn make
for increased feelings of tension   motor and psychic restlessness succeed 
the motor expression manifests itself most often in habit movements of
disguised sexual significance  autoerogenous pleasures  a form of physical
stereotypy  in its broadest psychophysical meaning  the mental state often
pari passu takes up obsessive thinking and various physical acts and
thoughts are formed as defense mechanisms  born of conscious guilt   the
motor habits are usually inhibited or displaced in part  and the tic remains
as a motor symbol  usually in itself non sexual  as a fragment of the former
complete habit movement  the mechanism of the completely evolved tic is
either a conversion  hysteric  or substitution  obsessive  mechanism or
both  

by these who have studied freudism this will  in a way  be understood  for
these who have not it may be more difficult of understanding without
somewhat further elaboration or explanation  in this connection i must again
mention that the freudians include tics under their obsessive  obsessional 
neuroses  the theory of the mental mechanisms and evolution of these states
is given in the attached quotation  which is taken verbatim from clark s
paper 

 the affect of the painful idea does not become transformed into physical
symptoms  as in the conversion mechanism of hysteria  but affixes itself to
other ideas not in themselves unbearable  thus producing by this false
relationship a substitutive symptom or obsession 

        in all such obsessive neurotics the transformed reproaches which
have escaped repressions are always connected with some pleasurably
accomplished sexual act of childhood but may be almost entirely lost  the
obsessive acts really represent the conflict between impulses of opposite
instincts  love and hate  which are usually of equal value  the warring
conflict engendered makes for a curiosity to discover the meaning of life
forces  sexual largely  and the desire to know the end thereof  the
nuclear complex of all this is a precociousness of emotional life and an
intensive fixation on one or the other parent or brother or sister  the
intensive love fixation waxes the stronger as the unconscious hate requires
increased barriers against its breaking through into the main or everyday
personality   as a result of these conflicts the will is partially weakened 
there is an incapacity for resolution  first in the realm of love alone 
then later succeeds a diffusion or displacement of the mechanism all over
the field of activity  a series of secondary defense mechanisms are now
brought in and these may enable the obsessive person to get square in a
limited way  as religious practices enable many to do   some special
adaptation is required sooner or later  and the individual  having used up
all the helps  then falls back upon the different forms of obsessive acts
and thinking  thus the obsessive neurosis is generated  

clark then proceeds to explain 

 if one is not permitted to draw deductions from a few data as to the
further genesis of the tic disorders  we may still hold out a tentative
hypothesis  pieced together from many sources that a certain type of nervous
make up is inherited  in such the emotional life is precocious much beyond
the intellectual faculties   the ticquer in infancy has the emotional
feelings of love and hate of an adult  their very precociousness aids the
parental fixation and adhesion  and makes it the more difficult for the
libido to detach itself at the proper age   one should bear in mind that the
parental fixation in itself does not directly produce the mishaps of adult
life but this small fault in infancy generates wider and wider
maladaptations as development progresses   it is these latter glaring faults
and trends that make for the character defects  and these really break down
the final effort at adaptations and adjustments producing the tic or
obsessive disorder  but the essential nucleus of the defect is lack of
balance  precocious parental fixation  and continued attachment to the
parent stem  that makes the adult defect possible  the very infantile
precociousness of the emotions argues for the hereditary transmission of
destructive temperamental qualities  here  as elsewhere in tracing
hereditariness in so called functional nervosities  one should take as the
unit character for study the mental traits or trends and exclude definite
disease entities applied to ancestral disorders  i believe it is not too
suppositious to think that many of these variant individuals are really
atavistic in makeup and have continued from one generation to another
special defective traits of emotional makeup which are fortunately denied
the average individual  

the writer cannot understand how the theory which he has taken the trouble
to so fully present in the above quotations can be maintained  jones and
clark both assert that the tics or habit spasms as probably of the same
nature as the obsessions in general  moreover  jones agrees that  familiar
examples of compulsion in a slight degree are the obsessive impulses to
touch every other rail of an iron fence as one walks past  to step on the
cracks between the flagstones of the pavement  or not to step on them  and
so on   a little reflection will show us the impossibility and illogicality
of viewing all these conditions as being fundamentally of sexual origin  let
us follow the argument   if tics are of sexual derivation  as the freudians
here openly maintain  then it must follow that those familiar examples of
compulsion  such as the obsessive impulse to touch every other post  etc  
are likewise of sexual origin  this conclusion is forced upon us  since 
even according to jones  the only difference between the marked tics and the
lesser manifestations is one of degree     now  these slighter impulsive
tendencies to which we have here referred are very frequent in all children
and by no means infrequent in grown ups  they are habitual movements  which
may be of transient duration only or may  by repeated performance  develop
into more or less fixed habits  if  then  these habits are of sexual
significance  it must follow that all other habits  especially if associated
with a certain degree of consciousness or awareness  are in like manner
symbolical of the past infantile and early childhood sexual activities and
tendencies   this conclusion is  as is seen  inevitable  if we believe in
the freudian theory of the pathogenesis of the tics  however  since this
leads us to a reductio ad absurdum  we must  of course  reject the
explanation which has been offered by the freudian school 

    the accompanying mental state characteristic of ticquers is absent in
habits   we can stop doing the latter when our attention is directed to
them  not so in tics meige and feindel have discussed these and other
differences 

perhaps i should also mention the fact that all of these symptoms or
tendencies which one finds in ticquers occur in other individuals who do not
present tics  and  furthermore  that all normal individuals possess these
qualities or tendencies in varying degrees of intensity and in varying
combinations  and that this applies to adults as well as to children 
although  of course  they are seen most characteristically in children  i
may further add that the difference between the mental infantilism which we
find present in the tic psychoneurosis and that which we observe in other
 normal and abnormal  conditions is one of degree rather than of kind 
therefore  the most we can say of the mental condition in ticquers is that
there is an exaggeration of the mental infantilism or a fixation at or
tendency toward regression to this type of thinking or of reaction  and this
leads us to the further conclusion  and it is this point which i desire to
bring out in this connection  namely  that since the difference between the
mental infantilism in all of these conditions is relative  being one of
degree and of proportionate relationship or at any rate of genesis 
evolution and meaning  it naturally follows that what is in the conclusions
of clark  as mentioned above  asserted to be an absolute and basic principle
or truth applicable to the tics  must consequently be true  but in different
degree  of all the other conditions of a similar or allied nature  surely
the motive source is fundamentally the same in all of these conditions 

furthermore  tics occur in animals  especially in horses  and the whole
picture  physical and mental  of tics in horses resembles that which we find
in human beings  particularly idiots and imbeciles  with tics  and the
ultimate  fundamental meaning and motive source of tics in man is and must
be the same as that of tics in horses 

to put clark s idea in a nut shell  it may be said that he believes that the
primary purpose of tics is not that of a protective  defense mechanism
against unpleasant situations in life but that of obtaining really
pleasurable gratifications to the psyche  these autopleasurable acts being
based on inherent defects and having a sexual significance in the sense in
which sexuality is conceived by freud   the protective  defense mechanism
is  according to this view  but secondary to the primary and <p 340  
fundamental purpose of obtaining the autopleasurable gratifications to the
psyche 

although approving of the analytic and genetic tendency displayed by freud 
clark and the freudian school in general  it is regrettable to me that the
analytic tendency and reconstructive efforts of the freudians in the field
of neurology and psychopathology have been seriously marred by their
insistence on forcing all observed physical and psychical phenomena and
reactions into line with their fixed sexual theories and their special
psychology  which is basically wrong in many fundamental and important
standpoints 

the writer will agree with the freudians that there must be a cause for the
appearance of these tics   this cause existed in the past  it has in the
course of time been forgotten  but still exists somewhere in the
subconsciousness or memory   this forgetting has been brought about by a
process of dissociation from the original exciting cause  but the writer
will not agree that this dissociation has been  of necessity  brought about
by psychic repression on the part of the individual  that by psychoanalysis
the condition can be traced back to the sexual activities or tendencies of
infantile or early childhood origin  or that the condition may be cured when
the original cause is made known to the patient through psychoanalysis 
without the training of the will so necessary in this condition 

thus the analytic tendency of the freudian school is to be highly commended 
but this analysis should not be limited to sexual analysis  but should
include a consideration of all of man s instincts  nor should the analysis
be limited to present life psychic factors alone  but should be viewed from
a psychobiological standpoint   in this way only will all antecedent
causative factors  physical and mental  be included in our analytic
observation and speculation 

to fully discuss or to prove the error of clark in his conclusions would
necessarily lead me into a general discussion of freudism  which i cannot do
in this place  since the ramifications are too numerous and the problems
involved would lead to lengthy and tiresome discussion  pro and con  i must 
however  mention the exclusively sexual standpoint assumed by the freudian
school in their interpretations of physical and psychical activities  their
classifying of all activities characterized by a certain rhythmicity and
periodicity  and accompanied by a certain degree of satisfaction   in other
words of all autopleasurable activities  as sexual  in the freudian sense  
and the neglect of comparative and behavioristic psychology with proper
consideration for man s phylogeny and ontogeny or of his true genetic
history  from the racial and world history and not alone from the
individualistic psychological standpoint   as a matter of fact the
conception of sexuality assumed by freud and his followers has undergone
many changes and is by no means definite and clean cut in its outlines  a
criticism of the conception of sexuality cannot be entered upon here  i may
merely state that what is an absolute and fixed law for the tics  what is
the fundamental and basic explanation or theory of the genesis and meaning
of the tics must apply also to all habit movements wherever and whenever
they occur  and  in like manner  to all habit formations of whatever nature 
and since our habits are but the prolongations of our instincts  the latter
also would be included within the purview of the same generalization  in
other words  if all tics have a sexual meaning  then all instincts  which
means the vital energy of man  has the same meaning   this question i have
discussed in another place 7  and cannot enter upon here 

 7  a critical review of the conception of sexuality assumed by the freudian
school   medical record  march 27  1915 

without furthur elaboration or discussion i am content to give the freudian
conception to you as i have outlined it above and to let it stand for what
it is worth 

i may say that in the physical aspect of tics we have a specific somatic
manifestation which  if explained  should  in a way  be the gateway toward
the understanding of the many somatic symptoms which we find in the
psychoneuroses and psychoses 



the evolutionary  phylogenetic standpoint

a year or more before clark s paper appeared  i had arrived at certain
general conclusions regarding the subject of tics 

g  stanley hall has arrived at similar conclusions in his inspiring
synthetic genetic study of fear 8  and i wish here to acknowledge my
indebtedness to his paper for making my own ideas clearer to me  for having
given me broader standpoints and for clearly presenting a theory which shall
form the basis of the remainder of this paper 

 8  in the american journal of psychology  vol  xxv  in the july issue et
seq 

let us first take up the tic movements and see whether we can arrive at a
rational explanation for their appearance 

the different varieties of tic movements embrace the entire field or range
of systematic  physiologically coordinated voluntary muscular activities 

the main types of tics may be enumerated at this point  facial tics  which
are the most frequent and which may be tonic or clonic  are tics of mimicry
and express emotions  tics of the ear or auditory tics  nictitation and
vision tics  particularly of the eyelids  tics of sniffing  tics of sucking 
tics of licking  tics of biting and of mastication  and mental trismus  tics
of nodding  tossing  affirmation  negation  salutation and mental
torticollis  trunk  arm and shoulder tics  snatching tics  the professional
or occupational spasms  which are really a special atypical form of tics 
walking and leaping tics  tics of spitting  swallowing  vomiting  eructation
and wind sucking  aerophagia   tics of snoring  sniffing  blowing 
whistling  coughing  sobbing  hiccoughing  tics of speech  including all
sorts of sounds  stammering  in some cases   habit expressions  echolalia
and echopraxia 

it is thus seen that we have here physiological and biological acts of
different manifestations and purposes 

the tic movements have a certain significance at the time of their
performance   the physiological functions are definite 

the magnan school insisted that tics are not morbid entities but episodic
syndromes of mental degeneration   charcot referred to tic as a sort of
hereditary aberration  which  i may add  is surely true when we view it from
the phylogenetic standpoint  as representing a resurrection of what was at
one time a normal tendency or reaction  noir has called attention to the
fact that the movements found in the tics correspond to the infant s
spontaneous muscular play  which means the muscular play of all mankind 

these authors were directing their efforts in the right direction  to
appreciate this we need but remember that the mechanisms or the
potentialities for the movements are inherited and have a phylogenetic
significance   at a lower psychic level  far back in our phylogenetic racial
history  all of these movements  perhaps then in a rudimentary form  had a
single  original meaning  this meaning was self preservation  and it was
because of its value as a means of adaptation or reaction to the
environment  with the consequent maintenance of self preservation  that the
movements or the mechanisms of the movements were selected for survival and
for hereditary transmission as inherent  unconscious  organic mechanisms 
processes or engrams  the original  phylogenetic significance attained at a
low cultural or psychic level  relatively unconscious  may or may not later
be consciously associated or dominate its subsequent functioning  but its
primary  biological significance  its real raison d etre is to be found in
the phylogenetic  racial history of man  the present life history with its
varied experiences do but act as stimuli or as exciting factors to bring
once more into activity functions which have been preserved in the organic
structure of the nervous system 

in our return to phylogenetic  ontogenetic  rudimentary  unconscious 
organic reactions  to atavistic  prehistoric  performed  embryonic  immature
methods of response  the vestigial remnants  revivals of long ago  which
have been submerged but which now reappear due to our reversionary
tendencies  uprooted by dissociation  disintegration or regression  with its
lapse or descent to low cultural or psychic levels  these old components
which reappear or rather fall apart and appear as independent activities 
are exaggerated  inflated  caricatured or excessively performed  in our
devolutionary tendency toward ancestral methods of reaction  the individual 
resolved  so to speak  into his proximate elements  permits or is compelled
by biological determinism to permit these split off tendencies to break
forth once more  albeit in exaggerated fashion  as if let loose from the
leash of control by the higher nervous centres  and reanimified 
intensified  and magnified  our infantile  archaic  instinctive  inherited 
hidden  phylogenetic tendencies or activities held sway 

it seems to me that it is well worth while to quote at some length from g 
stanley hall  that great exponent of genetic psychology and all that it
stands for   his very stimulating and inspiring paper on fear  to which i
have already referred  is freely quoted in the following paragraphs 

according to geneticism  stanley hall tells us  all responses to shock are
vestiges of once useful reactions   in fact  the shock neuroses and shock
psychoses  if analyzable psychogenetically   would be found to be reversions
to  and also perhaps more often than we suspect  magnifications of acts and
psychic states that were at one time the fittest of which our forebears were
capable  9  however  all the pathological phenomena of today are not mere
revivals of the acts and states of primitive man and his ancestors  but
 they are often  on the other hand  grotesque variants and intensifications
of phylogenetic originals that were more sane and simple if also more
generic  shock symptoms may thus be symbols of long past racial experiences
which when we have learned to interpret them more fully will tell us much of
the early history of our phylum   10  it is the outbreaks of emotion which
 mark the incursions of the race into the narrow life of the
individual   11

 10  loc  cit   p  179 

 11  loc  cit   p  183 

furthermore   the central nervous system differs from all others in that it
is par excellence the organ of registration and of physiological memory   it
is there that the traces of ancestral experience are stored so that almost
nothing that was ever essential in the development of the phylum is ever
entirely lost  hence suggestive as are many physical traits of our racial
history  the intangible psychophysic traits must be assumed to be both far
more numerous and more indelible 

 while these faint tendencies often crop out in a behavioristic way  by far
the most of them need some stimulus of individual experiences to awaken
them  and still more exist only in the slight facilitization of impulses or
permeability of nervous centres  lability of molecular or neural tensions 
or as preferential re enforcements  in one rather than in another direction
or manner   12 

 12  loc  cit   p  351 352 

it is obvious that motor expressions of shock or motor methods of adaptation
or reaction are much older and far more prominent than psychic  but although
a changed environment made the old types of defense obsolete  they still
persist   in a sthenic if somewhat now inco ordinated way  and when they are
called into action now they evoke a faint phosphorescence of the old
primordial feeling   13 

 13  loc  cit   p  197 

in brief it should be said that no matter how refined and how highly
cultured we are  we still fear and react to emotions  in the same terms of
the same old gross organs and functions as do the brutes   14

regression

as i have stated in a previous paper  15  the pathogenesis of tics and
allied conditions can best be appreciated by viewing the subject from an
evolutionary standpoint   in our reactions and adaptations to the varying
experiences with which we meet we respond by one or more of several methods
of motor reaction  these motor expressions are of increasing complexity as
we ascend the scale of evolution and development   one of the simplest kinds
of adaptation is by simple  reflex muscular action  the response being
anatomical and not physiological in its extent  then come our simple
physiological reactions   a more complex reaction is by those
physiologically co ordinated motor reactions or movements which go to
comprise our pantomimic movements  this is seen most characteristically in
our facial expressions  gestures  mimicry and dancing   still higher up in
the scale we find our conduct and feelings as exemplified in our speech  and
finally  highest of all  we must place our conduct as shown in written or
printed language   this is a brief outline of our evolutionary and
developmental ascent and of the increasing complexity and refinement of our
social conduct 

 15  tics   interstate medical journal  january and february  1915 

in our motor adaptations we respond in one or more of these ways  when for
some reason or another one outlet us denied us  we find avenues of
expression through one or more of the other paths  now  the manner and
degree of our response is dependent on our stage in evolution and
development  on the development of our senses  on our instincts  feelings
and emotions  on our intellect and experiences  unable to find expression by
means of writing or speech  we instinctively fall back upon and seek
expression by a less refined method  one earlier acquired and thus lower in
the scale of evolution  this has a more or less general application
throughout the scale of human  individual and social  conduct   it is an
application of the universal law of adaptation to existing conditions in the
best manner possible under the circumstances   we may thus lay down in a
general sort of way a conception which i like to call the theory of
psychophysical progression  fixation and regression along evolutionary and
developmental lines  in the case of tics the regressive or devolutionary
aspect comes in for special consideration   we may react mainly physically 
or mainly psychically   but as a rule we react by both physical and psychic
means  the manner and degree of our conduct being determined  as above
mentioned  by our stage in evolution and development 

how does all this preliminary and general discussion apply to the problem of
the tics   the relation seems to me to be most intimate and most important 
the tics are methods of response or reaction to certain external irritations
or ideas  this response being the manner of adaptation   the response may be
mainly motor or mainly psychic  most frequently psychomotor  when the source
of irritation and the cause for action is known  our conduct is more
specific and is apt to be less diffuse  less inadequate  less indefinite 
in our reactive adaptations  which  as explained above  are greatly
dependent upon our psychophysical make up or constitution  we protect
ourselves consciously or more or less unconsciously against disagreeable 
inimicable  unpleasant or irritating environmental factors  physical or
psychical  by bringing into activity certain psychical or physical or
psychophysical reactions or processes   the special defense reactions
brought into the foreground are those which follow the line of least
resistance  due to hereditary or environmental construction  or are those
which were most intensely stimulated or irritated and the most biologically
useful and adaptive at the particular moment or under the special
circumstances   the young child s reactions are preponderately motor  or at
any rate psychomotor and not purely psychic  when there are sources of
irritation or bodily or mental discomfort  there is a more or less general
bodily reaction  psychophysical in nature  when the irritation is definite
and clearly recognized by the child  the local motor response is also apt to
be definite   when  on the other hand  the irritation is but vaguely
perceived and not clearly appreciated or localized  we find that the child
may show a general diffuse reaction  or even  in some cases  a reaction
limited to certain regions as determined by the reaction taking place along
the line of least resistance  this is plainly seen in the conduct of the
physically sick child  every pediatrician will find ample proof in support
of this statement in his observations of the defensive reactions of the ill
child 

when this irritation along a certain nerve path is oft repeated or quite
constant  we have a consequent repetition of the defensive reaction 
whatever it may be   this performance may be so frequently repeated that the
idea of irritation or mental conflict or the anticipation or the expectation
of a repetition of same may be quite sufficient in itself to arouse this
reaction   it may become so habitual that  even though no such idea be in
the mind  there may be a repetition of the movement whenever the individual
is nervously excited or upset  whenever there is any mental stress  strain
or discomfort  and we may go even further and say that as a result of some
unusual mental struggle  some excessive mental strain  defense or adaptation
is brought about by regression or resort to a tic  this being conditioned by
the fact that for the particular individual under discussion this is the
easiest  most convenient or most immediate form of reactive response  the
discharge is  as is seen  along the line of least resistance  this line of
least resistance is determined by the organic nervous constitution and by
certain life experiences or habit formation factors  in some cases the
movement  once initiated  may be continued long after the disappearance or
cessation of the external irritation  because of the sense of relief or
satisfaction or pleasure    which is obtained by the performance of the tic 
in many instances the habit has become rather fixed  and  as a relief from
the struggle to do or not to do the movement  and because of fatigue in the
effort to inhibit or control the movement  the individual adopts the path of
least resistance  best for immediate relief from mental struggle  and as a
psychobiological effort at self preservation and self gratification  as
immediately as possible and at any cost to be paid in the future  he gives
vent  as it were  to the movement 

    this is not  of course  of a sexual nature the freudian school
notwithstanding 

the psychic symptoms may come on at a later date than the motor symptoms or
simultaneously  although  of course  the early life history  in childhood
and puberty  for example  if we are dealing with an adult  may show  at
least in a certain proportion of cases  that the individual was of a
psychopathic type  perhaps somewhat shut in or asocial  if the appearance of
the psychical symptoms be simultaneous with that of the physical symptoms 
we can understand at once how  like the motor symptoms  they may be repeated
time and again   in many instances  at least  the psychic symptoms arise
later  being added to the motor symptoms  these later psychic symptoms may
be a direct reaction to the source of irritation  or may be occasioned by
the dissatisfaction at being unable to control the movement in question 

the degree of reaction  its duration and severity  depend upon the
hereditary and developmental make up of the individual and the severity 
frequency and duration of the irritation  physical or psychical  the psychic
element is particularly apt to vary   the more neuropathic and psychopathic
the make up the greater is the reaction 

where mental enfeeblement or mental disorder exist  the severity and
chronicity are apt to be still greater 

there is thus a fixation  or rather a regression or reversion  oft repeated 
to a type of reaction of a very infantile  primitive sort  farther down in
the scale of evolution and development 

this picture may be further complicated by so called neurasthenic 
psychasthenic  hysterical or other reactions   naturally one would expect to
find these conditions  especially the more aggravated forms  in individuals
of a neuropathic and psychopathic family strain  and who themselves are
neuropathic or psychopathic or both 

it may be mentioned here  as is clearly appreciated from what has been said
before  that there is an interrelationship between the tics on the one hand
and the symptoms which we discover in the psychoneuroses  psychoses and the
mentally unstable on the other 

in all of these conditions we find a cortical origin for the disturbance 
there is a lack of will power  of inhibition and of control of the lower
centres  there is a nervous and mental instability with a tendency toward
regression or dissociation  and the assumption of more or less independent 
almost automatic activity  this activity being characterized by its almost
 relatively  infantile  primitive  archaic makeup 

were i to take up any one of the tics as an illustration  this general idea
could be applied very nicely  but i shall not present any illustrative cases
in this paper  i shall leave it to the reader  however  to explain the
genesis and evolution of  for example  facial tics  which are so common 
from this standpoint 

in passing i may say that the tic movements may have a special  individual 
psychological significance   but this is by no means necessarily so 
frequently  i am inclined to believe usually  these movements result rather
merely because there has been effected a psychobiological reaction 
following the theory of psychophysical progression  fixation and regression
with involvement of the nervous paths most seriously affected or most easily
disturbed 

in the case of the tics  therefore  it is as if the various tic movements
are being used in reaction to or in adaptation to sources of internal or
external  physical or mental irritation  for the protection  defense or
self preservation of this or that particular part of the nervous system  as
if the movements which we find in the tics and which are the expressions of
certain engrams  neurograms  mnemes or organic memories  are existing in and
for themselves  except that  in the tics  they are reacting with and for the
psychophysical organism  the organic make up or personality 

the individual  as a biological unit  is reacting to the particular
situation which presents itself by the tic mechanism 

by granting the phylogenetic  racial significance we also give the basic 
psychophysical meaning of tics in all ticquers 



exciting factors

how is it that these activities may come into play again  what brings them
to the surface once more 

there are many factors which come in for consideration in this connection 
in the first place the basic cause is the instinctive  organic 
psychophysical make up of the individual   whether and which functions
re exist as of old and respond as means of adaptation and self preservation 
depends on the stability and the weaknesses or defects of the nervous
mechanism or system with its various parts  systems  functions or inherent
psychophysical dispositions on the one hand  and the life experiences and
the immediate inciting factor on the other hand 

a neuropathic or psychopathic or neuropsychopathic constitution with its
usual causes  germinal  intrauterine or extrauterine  usually of a toxic 
infectious or disturbed metabolic nature  and including particularly
alcohol  syphilis and nutritional disorders  may form the ground work   this
predisposition may be congenital  that is  present from the date of birth 
although not necessarily germinal in origin  or it may be acquired at some
period in life from physical or psychic causes   in this connection the
infantile and early childhood history are very important  consequently the
diseases  training  example  education and opportunities in childhood and
infancy are of very great significance  the parental training and example
and the home conditions having a most intimate relationship to the
development of many of these tics  imitation and mimicry here play a decided
role   spoiled children  too quickly satisfied or over repressed  are apt to
develop tics  external somatic irritations may be the starting point in some
 not in all  cases   at other times an idea  normal or abnormal  may incite
the tic movements   auto and hetero suggestion  hypochondriacal ideas 
hysterical symptoms and obsessions may  particularly in adults  initiate
tics   obsessions are especially apt to produce habits or tics  if they
produce any motor reaction  tics may develop into obsessions and vice versa 
or both may co exist simultaneously and be unrelated   the original ideas
which led to the movements vanish while the movements survive  in the insane
various sorts of delusions may be the groundwork on which a tic may later
develop   habit movements  which represent purposive physiological acts
which have become automatic and not inhibited  hence showing weak will
power  and which seek strongly for expression  which the individual
struggles against and endeavors consciously to inhibit and overcome after
the tendency is fairly well developed  may eventually become impulsive and
irresistible with the ultimate evolution of the psychic state which is
characteristic of ticquers  automatic habits and mannerisms or stereotyped
acts are of course not tics but the latter are but caricatures of the former
with an added characteristic mental state   tics  as mentioned earlier in
this paper  are thus pathological habits 

tics may also be but the symbol for a vague feeling of tension  irritation
or stimulation  which seeks relief or expression by the performance of the
tic 

emotional stress and strain  fright  fear  excitement and mental shock can
arouse a tic   mental conflict and unrest has not received that degree of
attention which it surely deserves   clark and the freudian school have
definitely called our attention to this aspect  bresler refers to tic as a
motor reaction to original mental shock  so that it is in fact a psychic
defense reaction of expression  dupre has stated that emotional shock may
act as a possible exciting cause of tics  as at times of obsessions   meige
and feindel have asserted that fear may excite a movement of defense  and
although the exciting cause has vanished  this movement may continue to
persist as a tic  they also mention that in ticquers we frequently find the
impulse to seek a sensation and to repeat to excess a functional act 

that there is a weakness of will power in the ticquer  with a lack of
control or inhibition over the lower neurones normally regulated by the
higher co ordinating centres  so that certain automatic activities become
dissociated and exist more or less independently  is generally acknowledged 

in fact it must be said that tics are reactions of the organism  of the
organic make up  the psychophysical personality  as a response to
irritation  excitation or stimulation  sensory  nervous or psychic  it is a
means of relief of tension  of organic reaction or adaptation  not
necessarily conscious but frequently unconscious and automatic  as in fear 
starting in this way it may persist   in the tic we see a method by which
the individual or organic personality has met a certain difficult or
undesirable or disturbing situation  it is thus a constitutional  biological
defense reaction  psychophysical in nature  with a reversionary tendency
 when viewed from the evolutionary standpoint   and hence is indicative of
degeneration  this term being used in the racial  biological  phylogenetic
and ontogenetic sense 

there is not such a far cry from the simplest tic to gilles de la tourette s
disease or maladie des tics with its more pronounced signs of psychophysical
deterioration and dissociation   the tendency is a degenerative one   a
prolapse to ancestral methods of reaction  a dissociation or disintegration
of the personality  a lack of control over more elementary activities  we
should therefore appreciate the need of early recognition and treatment of
tics and fixed habit movements  especially since there is a tendency to
spread  for the tics to multiply  and for mental symptoms and reactions of a
hysterical and psychasthenic nature to appear  if they do not already exist
or have not existed before the onset of the tic 

in brief  then  tics represent the emotional reactions and feelings of the
individual  the loves and the hates  the likes and the dislikes  the wishes
and the fears  the cravings and the dissatisfactions  the bodily and mental
tension  unrest  excitement  discomfort and disequilibration  in other words
the ticquer feels and speaks and acts by the tic  he lives by  in and for
his tic   he is attempting to meet certain situations of a disturbing nature
and to obtain equilibrium and equipoise by compensating for his feelings of
inefficiency and unrest by the tics  it is an organic  constitutional 
psychophysical  biological means of adaptation 



progressive evolution of the condition

we now come to the progressive evolution of the motor manifestations and to
the mental aspect of this condition 

concerning the mental state characteristic of the ticquer it is generally
agreed that there is a polymorphic psychic defect or disorder which shows
itself particularly in a precocious or hyperemotional condition  in a lack
of will power and of inhibitory control  leading to a state and feeling of
doubt  indecision  incapacity  insufficiency and unreality  of inferiority
and self depreciation  with a tendency towards morbid self absorption 
egocentricity  self observation  auto and hetero suggestion  with the
consequent development in many instances of so called neurasthenic 
psychasthenic  hysteric and various psychotic reactions  i am not prepared
to say definitely how frequently the mental state  in lessened degree 
precedes the outbreak of the tic movements  this may be present in a certain
proportion of cases  but is by no means always present and it is even
questionable whether the predispositional mental condition is the ground
work in the majority of patients 

tics  it is true  are especially apt to develop in individuals with a
neuropathic or psychopathic history or heredity   in other cases this
history is not obtainable  the individual having been apparently perfectly
normal up to the time of the outcropping of the tic   in these cases shock
is apt to bring on the outbreaks and so one may say that the instability had
been latent and that a severe shock was sufficient to bring it to the
surface  we must remember  in all these cases  that the mental state which
we see in the ticquer is but an exaggeration of that which appears in many
children  and is similar to that which appears also in other psychoneurotic
states  and in fact the germs of this condition may occur transiently in any
of us  this psychic condition may frequently but does not always precede the
appearance of the tic movement   but it is only after the appearance of the
motor manifestations of tic that the mental state becomes prominent or
develops where it was not noticeable if not absent before 

be that as it may  or even granting that in most patients the characteristic
mental state or the neuropathic or psychopathic make up exists in some
measure to an abnormal extent  we do know that once the tic movements have
made their appearance and begin to spread  so that the individual is thrown
into the struggle to perform or not to perform the movement  the development
of the psychic state which we find so patent in the more pronounced forms of
tic  thereafter more or less rapidly occurs  no matter what the mental
condition of the ticquer may have been previously  i am also not prepared to
discuss here at any length the phylogenetic or ontogenetic significance and
the biological genesis and meaning of the various mental trends of the
ticquer  but i may say that they too have been acquired in the course of
evolution  for certain very definite reasons which need not concern us here 
although it can be appreciated that the biological motive of
self preservation played a most important role in their genesis and
fixation 



application of adler s theory of the neurotic to tics

the progressive spreading of the tic movement which so commonly occurs  as
well as the evolution of the mental aspect which develops subsequent to the
appearance of the tic movement  may be very nicely understood if we adopt 
for our present purposes the recent theories of alfred adler  16  of vienna 
concerning the makeup and development of the neurotic  this we may do
without committing ourselves  at this moment  one way or the other  with
regard to the correctness or incorrectness of adler s views as applied in
toto to the neurotic 

 16  ueber den nervosen charakter  1912   see also adler s studie uber
minderwertigkeit von organen  1907 

one should note that meige and feindel were  in a way  on the threshold of
this theory when they said that tic  like the other psychoneuroses  is due
to some congenital anomaly  an arrest or defect in the development of
cortical or subcortical association paths  unrecognized teratological
malformations 

in a very few words adler s theory may be given as follows  adler assumes
that there is definite somatic inferiority  based on anatomical and
physiological changes  as the basis or foundation for the neurotic soil 
the neurotic consciously comes to realize the unconscious  organic  somatic
inferiority  and the endeavor to effect a psychic compensation or to make up
for these organic deficiencies by certain definite mechanisms  frequently
results in an overreaction or over compensation  he thus overdoes himself in
efforts to make up for his inferiority  and in these endeavors he
necessarily makes use of unusual means and devices   it is this effort which
is the great motive force which dominates the life activities of the
individual and which compels him to seek as his ultimate object or final
goal a state which is best described as one of complete masculinity  of full
manhood  of self maximization  of the will to live  to become powerful and
to seek supremacy or  the will to power   nietzsche   in following this goal
he goes to extremes and employs peculiar methods and devices  most of which
have for their object the concealment of his defects  and it is these
overcompensatory efforts and these peculiar devices resorted to  which go to
form the peculiarities or traits of the neurotic  according to adler s
theory  the conscious efforts of the individual for psychic compensation or
overcompensation  for the unconscious  organic deficiencies  leads to a
resulting feeling of insufficiency  of incompleteness  of inferiority  of
unreality  of anxiety  of inability to face reality  thus the mental
symptoms or characteristic mental state  being but the conscious recognition
of the unconscious inferiority  become especially pronounced when there is a
failure of compensation  or  in other words  when the individual is unable
to meet with or adapt to the situation which at the moment presents itself 
in these forced efforts at defense and compensation there is a resort or
regression to older  infantile  child like  archaic types of reaction  of a
physical or mental nature  which are thus the protective defense mechanisms
or symbols  the struggle of the neurotic consists particularly in the
conscious appreciation of his goal and of his deficiencies of makeup and in
the attempt to reach his goal of full manhood and self maximization in spite
of his handicapping deficiencies 

without discussing the exact status of this theory in the case of the
psychoneuroses and their related conditions in general  we may  as mentioned
previously  very conveniently use this theory in the elucidation and
understanding of the further development of the tic condition 

let us first consider the spreading of the tic movements  we know how in the
ticquer one tic movement may disappear only to give way to another  or one
after the other an increased number of tic movements and also of definite
compensatory movements not of a tic nature but of the nature of antagonistic
gestures and stratagems may make their appearance  the latter may in certain
instances become habit movements and eventually real tic movements   one
movement after the other may be resorted to  some perfectly consciously 
others more or less unconsciously  as reactions of the personality  of the
organic makeup or psychophysical constitution  these movements are adopted
by the patient  frequently more or less unconsciously  in order to attain a
state of equilibrium and rest  and in order to hide and make up for the
defect  the tic movements  of which he is aware  in these efforts he
overdoes himself and instead of hiding the movement he exaggerates it and
even resorts to further movements in his struggles to compensate  to adapt 
to conceal  and to flee from a state of mental disarrangement to a state of
psychophysical equilibrium 

now  most of our gross reactions are of a psychophysical nature  so that we
find that when the old types of defense or of activity are called forth  as
they are in the tics  as explained earlier in this paper  from the
evolutionary and phylogenetic standpoint   the resulting actions  now
reanimified  appear in exaggerated form  and also tend to  evoke a faint
phosphorescence of the old primordial feeling   this probably results in the
outcropping of the various psychic trends which appear in the ticquer and
which increase in degree and in number  the most common of the resurrected
psychic trends is the general tendency to dissociation or disruption of the
personality with the reanimification  in varying degrees  of certain mental
deficiencies and inferior types of reaction which are indicative of the
relative failure of the patient to measure up to and efficiently deal with
and adapt to the struggles of life as he must face and meet them   and so 
many undesirable and inferior kinds of mental trends come forth and hold
sway  the basis of their appearance is the lack of will power and of control
over these various trends which were previously more or less completely held
under control but which are now impulsively forcing their way to the surface
and being unravelled   these trends are characterized by their relative
immaturity  their infantile like and archaic type  and so we have the states
of indecision  of doubt  of uncertainty  of inferiority  of depression  of
unrest  of self depreciation  of self observation  of auto and
heterosuggestion  of egocentricity  of self criticism  of inhibition of the
expression of the personality along the broader  social lines of effort 
the groundwork for added states  hysteric  psychasthenic  and others  is
here very fertile 

the law of psychic ambivalence and ambitendency  as so nicely developed by
bleuler  17  here shows itself in marked degree  there is both the positive
and the negative tendency toward the performance and execution of these
activities and reactions which are necessary for the living of a life of a
high or low degree of efficiency  so that the ticquer is obsessed by the
problem of  to do or not to do   this added factor leads to an exaggeration
of all the unfavorable psychic tendencies which have made their appearance 
and the intrapsychic struggle goes on with increased vigor 

 17  the theory of schizophrenic negativism   translated by william a 
white   nervous and mental disease   monograph series  no  ii 

the entire mental picture which we find in the most extreme forms of tic
could be beautifully elaborated along these general lines  for example  the
ticquer becomes asocial  seclusive and shuns society because of the
consciousness of the condition and the exaggerated sensitiveness  this
represents compensatory  defensive methods of concealment  absentmindedness
and the inability to concentrate the attention are conditioned by the great
degree of attention devoted to the tic  the mental dissociation or
disintegration leads to an inflating of the emotional aspect of the
patient s mental life with a resulting increased nervous irritability and
reaction and a heightened degree of susceptibility to emotional
disequilibration and fatiguability of the mental faculties   the lack of
self assertion  of confidence in himself  and the feeling of inferiority and
insufficiency are natural consequences of the general picture   the
inhibition of even  unhampered self expression is always observed 

in tics  it must be noted  there is regression to more inefficient and
inferior methods of response and adaptation  the types of activity being of
a somatic and psychic nature  following the regression and owing to constant
repetition and habit formation there is a gradual fixation to certain
methods of response which become the lines of least resistance and this is
followed by progression and development of the general picture to other tics
and psychic symptoms 

in general we note that the psychophysical reaction which we come upon in
the tics leads to the unearthing of various psychophysical types of
reaction  this unearthing consisting of disintegration or regression or
dissociation  the repressed  hidden  unconscious  phylo and ontogenetic 
archaic and relatively infantile like activities  tendencies and
possibilities coming to the fore and unfolding themselves 

it is here seen that this broad genetic standpoint is one of the greatest
contributions to psychopathology and is of infinite aid to us in the
understanding of the problems which confront us in the domain of
psychopathology and psychiatry 

comparative and animal psychology and the study of the reactions of
children  of primitive races  and of the mentally disordered give us a
splendid opportunity for studying it and unravelling the meaning of the many
somatic and psychic manifestations which are exhibited to us in the
psychoneuroses and psychoses and in tracing out the racial history of man 
is it not plain that an understanding of the genesis and meaning of tics
opens the gateway to the elucidation of the origin and significance of the
psychoneuroses and functional psychoses  of reaction types of various kinds

the individual delinquent   by william healy  a  b   m  d    little  brown  
co   boston  1915  

it is a rare and pleasant experience to meet a book on such a general topic
as delinquency  which has not as its raison d etre the exploitation of some
over worked hypothesis  the director of the psychopathic institute of the
juvenile court in chicago has  however  not only avoided this danger but has
given psychologists  jurists  and penologists such a report of his five
years work as not one of them can afford to overlook  as the title of the
work implies  the material is drawn from the individual study of the
delinquent   he presents the results of the unbiased investigation of the
discoverable factors in the production of criminality in 1000 recidivists 
who were mostly  though far from exclusively  adolescents   the period when
factors  both internal and external  are most easily determined and
modified 

a careful perusal of the introductory chapter on methods reveals both the
thoroughness and open mindedness of the author   he demonstrates that no
satisfaction was gained by the finding of any special mental or physical
abnormality  unless a more direct relation could be shown with the crime
committed than is established by mere coincidence  it is particularly
satisfying to note the precautions taken in the application of set tests 
how careful dr  healy and his assistants have been to determine the
completeness of cooperation on the part of the subject and to weigh this
factor in evaluating the results  one soon reaches the conclusion that the
author s own series of tests are much more likely to lead to reliable
diagnosis than the series of binet  which demands so much of the rather
specialized capacity of abstract formulation   healy s tests  on the other
hand  deal fairly with the primitive  untaught mind and that which has an
unequal and deceptive development of language ability  in connection with
these tests  it is interesting to note  by the way  that he finds
irregularity in results  or cooperation  to be so often associated with
epilepsy and depletion from sex over indulgence that it may be taken as a
suggestive diagnostic feature 

the value for the reader in discovering the eclectic view point and critical
conservatism of an investigator lies in the confidence which these qualities
beget in the reliability of results  one can read most of  the individual
delinquent  to learn facts without the distraction of critical uncertainty 
with this in mind  therefore  a few of his conclusions  picked mostly at
random  may be quoted  an important factor in the production of delinquency
he finds to lie in the premature appearance of adult sex development  a
precocity which he regards as dangerous because it seems to be correlated
with a stimulation of sex instinct before adult inhibitions appear  in girls
 not in boys  he finds a distinct tendency to general physical
over development as compared with the norm of the same age  in this
connection it is striking to find how many of his cases  which seem to
exhibit ingrained criminal tendencies  are delinquents only during the
period of adolescent instability  the various statistics are naturally also
of extreme interest  particularly since they are the result of examination
of 1 000 cases  chosen for this purpose only when there were sufficient data
secured to make the individual study relatively complete  and since they are
so at variance with the publications of others who have approached criminal
statistics to prove a theory rather than to learn facts  he finds alcoholism
in one or both parents in 311 cases  he cannot determine any direct
inheritance of criminal tendencies as such  but regards them as indirectly
of great importance as there were 61% who showed distinct defects in the
family antecedents  he thinks that stigmata of degeneration are probably
better correlated with mental defect and also with nutritional or
environmental conditions than with criminalism as such  followers of
lombroso will be disappointed to read that he found only 83 epileptics  or
possible epileptics  among his 1 000 cases  a full two thirds of the cases
presented no symptoms of mental abnormality while only one tenth were
definitely feeble minded  these are but scattered data  no digest  which
might be taken as substitute for the book itself  would be advisable 

it is to be expected  of course  that psychologists  and particularly those
interested in dynamic psychology  will find mixed pleasure in reading this
work   the section on  mental conflicts  must appeal to all with its
practical demonstration of what can be done by psychological analysis to
abolish anti social tendencies in many puzzling cases  there will
undoubtedly be disappointment in his failure to make general psychological
formulations  but  as the critics would differ amongst themselves as to what
these formulations should be  dr  healy s silence is here probably a wise
conservatism  at the same time there is certainly exhibited a tendency to be
rather too individual and give too few generalizations  this is evidenced by
his failure to regard as a factor in one case what has been admitted as such
in a slightly more obvious instance  to cite one example   on page 192  he
speaks of the inheritance of hypersexual tendencies  on page 166  we find 
       immodest behavior and use of obscene language on the part of a
parent  which we have so frequently found to be one of the main causes of a
girl going wrong         somewhat similar results are thus ascribed once to
heredity and again to environment  at this stage of our knowledge it would 
of course  be foolish to eliminate any specific inheritance as a factor  but
it is surprising that in the former case he does not consider environment as
a factor  although he elsewhere gives striking evidence of unconscious
influence proceeding from one individual to another via sex initiation 

it is possible that this lack of a broad psychological view point   this
example chosen is far from isolated  is connected with a specific  and most
definitely serious  defect in the book  the treatment of the psychoses is
distinctly unsatisfactory  apparently the author has had to rely on the
literature for his preparatory experience and has been fortunate only in
some cases  if we may judge by his references  the most satisfactory group
he describes is that of the traumatic psychoses and there he follows meyer s
admirable study  on the other hand  in introducing the dementia praecox
group  he makes no specific mention of any one of the cardinal symptoms of
disassociation or shallowness of affect  scattering of thought  and
delusions or hallucinations   his nearest approach is when he says 
 variations in the way of excitement  with dullness and paranoidal
excitement are seen during the course of the disease   this is followed by
the description of a case which he says contains the symptoms typical of the
psychosis but in which no pathognomic abnormality is mentioned except
negativism   a vague term whose meaning varies with the observer 

not unnaturally with such unfamiliarity  the psychosis is a  dispensation of
providence    there is no evidence that to him psychiatry is as much a
problem of every day life as it is of institutional care of the insane  we
can  therefore  find such a statement as this 

 the mental findings and the conduct determined the fact of aberration and
that is all that should be necessary for immediate court purposes  further
business of diagnosis should be left to a psychopathic hospital  

it is true that responsibility may and should be evaded when the psychosis
is full blown  but how about the innumerable cases of incipient psychotic
disturbance which grade over into the  mental conflicts  

in harmony with this diffidence is the repeated hope for aid from the
abderhalden   or some similar reaction   for instance 

 the newer methods of diagnosis of dementia praecox we look forward to for
help in one place where discrimination is important  

but surely a psychologist cannot hope to predict conduct by physical
findings   if dementia praecox postulated criminality  the situation might
be different  but  as it stands  the reaction would only be of value in the
doubtful cases   cases which are so many of them non institutional 

with this vague conception of the psychoses it is not surprising to find
that diagnosis used faute de mieux   for instance  in describing case 169 
of  pathological lying   he says 

 we could not in any way find evidence of mental peculiarity but we did
question his story because of intrinsic improbability   rather conflicting
statements   later on  he explains  the case was diagnosed as one of
 epileptic psychosis  because the subject developed convulsions  although
there is no evidence  or even claim  presented that the lying was an
equivalent  or in any way correlated with the epilepsy except as a
coincidence 

such faults in a book of this sort are serious but only in so far as the
work is theoretical   the main object of the book is to present facts in an
unbiased way and for the first time we have them in anything like
completeness  the importance of dr  healy s labors cannot  then  be
overestimated  his publication will be eagerly welcomed by the army of
workers who see a few cases at various stages of delinquency and who long to
know authoritatively what the types are  how they develop  what the outlook
is  and how that may be modified by appropriate treatment   we owe him much

human motives   by james jackson putnam  m  d  professor emeritus  diseases
of the nervous system  harvard university   boston   little  brown   co  
1915  12mo   price  1 

according to the publishers  announcement this is a study in the psychology
and philosophy of human conduct  based largely on the author s use of the
freudian psychoanalytic method of mental diagnosis   the editorial
introduction by dr  bruce consists in a brief outline of the subconscious
mind  the author s preface  aside from anticipating the main features of the
book  makes the announcement that the latter is based very largely on the
personal experience of the last two years  the author gives one the
impression that this period represents to him one in which he has to his own
satisfaction mastered the relationship between psychoanalysis on the one
hand and our current conception of moral philosophy  ethics and religion on
the other  during this period he has  studied motives at close range  

the work consists of six chapters and of these the first two deal with the
philosophic method of viewing man  while the others are devoted to
psychoanalysis   in the last chapter the author makes suggestions as to the
possibility of synthesizing the two methods 

human motives are either constructive or adaptive   the former are
associated with conscious reasoning and will  the latter with emotional
repressions  the former represent aspirations and are much higher than they
seem  since every man has an ideal   getting out the best that is in
himself   he is a  lover of the best  and will die for and live for mere
ideas and abstractions like patriotism   he is assumed to be free because he
voluntarily creates  and is as free as anything in the universe  and he is
free because he can choose   but where there is freedom there must be
clashing and compromise and repression   among repressed subjects are
prejudices and superstitions  which  while irrational  unconsciously affect
our conscious motives 

man has feelings of humanity and brotherhood but has also the feeling of
separate individuality which comes from the egoism of the young child  the
instincts also come into play in the conflict between duty to others and
love of self   no one  however good  can escape this conflict 

the old teaching as exemplified in philosophy and religion is based on a
study of man at his best  man in the abstract  this is incomplete because it
cannot promote such feelings as sympathy and understanding among men 
something has always been needed to supplement it and this is found in
psychoanalysis in which conditions are reversed 

religion the author regards as an existence which is in harmony with that of
the  universe personality   if we have the attributes we give to the deity
as reason  love  disinterested  and will  we should seek this harmony   the
 world of sense  is antagonistic to this conception  in that it leads us to
reject all other than sense knowledge  our notions of love  honor  power 
justice cannot spring from the sense world  we must look beyond the
latter  a mere illusion  to find the true  immutable   mind cannot be
evolved from life but must pre exist  god and man must be conceived in the
same way  both represent a totality of expressions of world will  both
create and persist in their creations  man must be regarded as creating his
thoughts and acts  even his own body  every portion of the universe is
responsible for every other portion  man  though ever changing  represents a
 self consciously unified person  and therefore feels responsible for all he
has ever done or ever will do  freud himself  as the author states  never
cared to generalize on the subject of psychoanalysis 

the book proceeds with a general outline of psychoanalysis which need not be
reproduced here   the subject of sexual repression  so far from being
exaggerated by freud  is completely borne out by centuries of teaching by
the church that all sexual matters must be repressed  because they proceed
solely from the flesh  the material world  as we have seen  however  the
author with others  both freudians and non freudians  makes the libido a
form of creative energy  which attitude lifts it above the purely material
plane  complete suppression of anything which will not down is regarded as
unwise hygiene of the soul  and the results of psychoanalysis  both as to
cause and cure of neurotic disturbances  amply sustain this view  a man s
unbidden thoughts are part of him and must be acknowledged 

psychoanalysis cannot be employed upon a number of subjects at once  it lies
between physician and patient  teacher and pupil  the unconscious but active
motive must be brought under the conscious will  the fantastic world of
childhood must be re created  the teacher  dealing with childhood has an
advantage over the physician who applies his analysis to adults 

the child should be encouraged to show all that is in him  and at the same
time must learn to regard himself less as an individual and more as a social
unit   he should do things which divert him from himself 

in psychoanalysis an act is nothing  a tendency everything  the latter must
be changed   in analysis of one s self one must avoid all tendency to self
depreciation  since all must make mistakes  one should also distrust in
himself whatever savors of emotional excess 

there is no radical difference between the neurotic and sound subject in
respect to the presence of unreasonable fears  compulsions and obsessions 
stress of circumstances causes even the normal man to show objectionable
traits   mental disease phenomena  like physical  indicate natural
reactions  or  attempts at repair  such as are found in the organic and even
inorganic worlds 

treatment by psychoanalysis represents an education  the removal of
inhibitions which are fixations or arrests 

the fifth chapter is in a way a resume of what the author had previously
said   he also seeks to reduce his teachings to a tabulation  the
rationalisation or adaptation of life progresses in proportion as the
individual is mature  but here maturity is by no means equivalent to age 
the process also is active in the immature child 

a subject is usually quite unaware of his fixations and explains the results
of his internal conflicts by false reasoning  rationalisation in this
connection becomes a bad habit 

all motives are creative   the act is not the result of the immediate motive
but of all those which preceded it  the final act throws no light on the
original motives 

in speaking of certain adults as children who never grew up  we are
referring to a much larger class than is commonly understood  all who attain
mature years with fixations are to be regarded as children  all
individualists belong here unless their individualism is merely a stepping
stone to altruism   indeed  we see in all men a desire to place themselves
on a pinnacle   this craving seeks expression in a thousand acts  even if
outgrown it may assert itself in times of stress   it is of benefit at times
when individuals espouse just but unpopular causes  what we ordinarily call
courage involves self assertion but a higher courage is involved in
refraining from certain things 

all individuals also have occasional cravings to get away from
responsibility and back to rest and pleasure  we long to get back to a
theoretical state of childhood  as the infant longs to return to his
mother s body 

for a number of reasons this not a work to be criticized  the author does
not mean to be dogmatic   his dicta  while they may have the ipse dixit
flavor  are not meant to be axioms  the creative energy of the mind can
formulate these dicta and they must clash with the convictions of others  it
is easy to deride the method as a method  but we must judge it by its
results   in emerson s hands it became a profound stimulus to thought to
people of quite dissimilar mental makeup  in like manner the author s work
will prove of the highest suggestive value to the reader  and especially the
materialistic reader  but aside from the general character of the book we
must not forget that it has a very definite object  to wit  to elevate
psychoanalysis to the highest planes of philosophical speculation and to
remove the prejudices of those who profess to go to the other extreme and
see in it only the slime of the pit  the author s attempt to bring it in
unison with the eternal verities is deserving of the highest commendation
and illustrates his deep faith in the nobility of this new resource for
understanding the spiritual side of man  l  pierce clark  m  d 



educational psychology   vol   i  the original nature of man vol  ii  the
psychology of learning   by edward l  thorndike   published by teachers
college  columbia university  new york  1913 

in the first three chapters of vol  i professor thorndike introduces what he
calls the  original tendencies  of man   these are the simpler and what have
often been called the  instinctive   or  innate  forms of behaviour  and
they are here taken as innate  in contradistinction to learned  as the
inherited dispositions on which the character of the adult is built  in
chapters iv to x  inclusive  these original tendencies are enumerated and
described   this is a valuable  although somewhat unordered  inventory of
the more elementary human activities   a wholesome step is taken in
replacing the terms  pleasure  and  pain   subjective categories supposed
from time immemorial to account for many sorts of reaction and to be the
basis of the learning process  by the more objective terms  satisfiers  and
 annoyers   the author inclines away from the common idea that very young
individuals exhibit random or diffuse activities

a curiously baffling and admirably sceptical chapter on the emotions  xi  is
followed by a largely destructive chapter on consciousness  learning  and
remembering  in which prof  thorndike is in point of literary style almost
at his worst  and in some cases incoherent  e g  p  185  middle   the
chapters on the anatomy and physiology  on the source  on the order and
dates of appearance and disappearance  and on the value and use of original
tendencies seem to the reviewer inconclusive and uninspired  there are
shrewd and interesting remarks here and there  particularly those of a
destructive intent  which the older reader will appreciate  while on the
whole he will wonder whether the author has  in these last four chapters 
any other than the whimsical aim of producing bedlam in the minds of his
younger readers 

vol  ii is a long treatise of 452 pages on the faculty of learning   the
author would probably reject the suggestion that he is dealing with his
subject in the spirit of the faculty psychology   learning  he would say  is
an empirical fact  which he is simply describing   so also  however  the
 faculties  are empirical phenomena  attention  memory  and all the rest 
the question is  do prof  thorndike and others like minded analyze the
phenomena in a way that reveals their mechanism  or in the unfruitful manner
of the faculty psychology  is  for instance  the mind an aggregate of the
following  functions that have been  or might be  studied   ability to spell
cat  ability to spell  knowledge that rt 289 equals 17  ability to read
english  knowledge of telegraphy         ability to give the opposites of
good  up  day  and night          fear and avoidance of snakes  misery at
being scorned   etc   etc   p  59   to the reviewer it appears that these
 functions  are cross sections of the mental life which reveal nothing of
the mind s real mechanism   this way  surely  lie the maximum of pedantry
and the minimum of scientific insight  the volume as a whole may be
recommended to those who wish to ascertain to what extent academic
psychology of to day is still dominated by the spirit of faculty psychology

sleep and sleeplessness   by h  addington bruce   little  brown   co 
boston  1915   pp  vii  219 

this book constitutes the third volume of the  mind and health  series   in
it the author has given an admirable and clear summary of the recent
psycho pathological work on sleep and sleeplessness   he begins by a
discussion of the nature of sleep and considering the difficulties involved
in making such a discussion clear to the average reader  the author has done
remarkably well in summarizing the technical work along this line  he then
passes to the problem of dreams and the part played by the unconscious
mechanism involved in dreaming  laying particular and justifiable stress
upon the point  that when problems are solved or adjusted in dreams  they
have always been previously solved by a kind of unconscious incubation
during the waking moments   the chapters on the disorders of sleep and the
causes of sleeplessness are brief but comprehensive  while in the discussion
of sleeplessness important stress is laid on the mental elements involved in
every case of insomnia  a strong plea is made for the psycho therapeutic
rather than the pharmacologica  treatment of the disorders of sleep  on the
whole the book is clearly written and can be recommended to those who wish a
brief and at the same time comprehensive account of the modern theories of
sleep and its disorders  isador h  coriat

historically speaking  dreams have always been credited with meanings  but 
in a given case  the psychologist must ask  how far does the accredited
meaning represent the mere fancy of the interpreted and how far does it
mirror actual conditions in the dreamer s mind  to seek aught beyond these
is but idle divination  for of all dreams it is true  in the words of ralph
waldo emerson   that the reason for them is always latent in the
individual    things are significant enough  heaven knows   he exclaims 
 but the seer of the sign   where is he   1 

not till the last year of the nineteenth century  did an answer come  it was
sigmund freud s work   the interpretation of dreams   which said  in effect 
 here am i  in vienna   2 



the freudian pretensions

 in the following pages   he begins   i shall prove that there exists a
psychological technique by which dreams may be interpreted and that upon the
application of this method every dream will show itself to be a senseful
psychological structure which may be introduced into an assignable place in
the psychic activities of the waking state  

the sweeping character of this pretension has not been justified  the
demonstration has succeeded only with that large class of dreams in which
there happens to be a trend of infantile reminiscence and of disguised
sexual phantasy  it fails to reveal the inner nature of other kinds of
dreams or the modus operandi of dreaming as a process of thinking  and while
it is asserted by the publishers of the english 3  edition that the main
contentions of his book have never been refuted  the fact is that his thesis
has not been accepted by the representatives of scientific psychology  as a
solution of the problem 

the exponents of freudian interpretations today are medical men associated
with the practice of so called  psychoanalysis   which means that they are
more concerned to apply freud s ideas for the treatment of nervous ailments
than to cultivate pure psychology  an examination of the methods they
exemplify in individual practice and in the large literature of the
psycho analytic movement shows sufficient reason  in my view  why the
psycho analytic theory of dreams should still be greeted with skepticism 
psycho analysts tell us that repugnance for the subject matter has delayed
acceptance of their essentially sexual interpretations  but there is also a
resistance based on sound logical criticism  judged by this standard 
freud s theory appears dangerously inaccurate and needs revision 



the two schools of psycho analysis

dr  c  g  jung  formerly a pupil and literal follower of freud  is
attempting to reform psycho analytic doctrine from within the fold  4 
incidentally  he tells us that there is nothing essentially novel about the
technique of investigating the dream in psycho analysis  it copies the
methods of historical and literary criticism and consists in collecting all
the data possible about each item of the dream  these are then called the
dream material   what seems to me novel and characteristic is the
psycho analytic method of working up this material into an interpretation by
a process of inference  freud and jung are today no longer in agreement as
to the details of this process  6  speaking of the interpretations of these
authorities  on the basis of extended investigations of dreams on my own
part  i must say that their methods do not seem to be as rigorous  as is
required today in the investigation of literary and historical problems  nor
capable of bearing comparison with experimental psychology 

it must be acknowledged  however  that freud has infinitely refined the
guesses of earlier generations of thinkers as to the relationship of
sleep fancies to the waking life  he has conferred startling precision upon
the general proposition of goethe  that these whimsical pictures  inasmuch
as they originate from us  may well have an analogy with our whole life and
fate   and he has certainly vindicated in practice that dictum of emerson 
 a skilful man reads dreams for his self knowledge   1  but he has
formulated no open sesame  as psycho analysts proclaim 

when it comes to the use of symbols  the viennese professor parts company
with the concord philosopher   the latter  as we know  decried the mystical
conception of fixed symbolism in any domain  but freud  although
theoretically agreed  falls victim in practice to the fascinations of the
dream book cipher method which he has condemned   the adjective freudian is
now justly a by word  among psychopathologists  for a stereotyped habit of
reducing each item of a dream to some cryptic allusion or roundabout
reference to the primitive demands of the infantile and sexual life  freud s
fertility in such interpretations has led one of our best known experimental
psychologists to say  in mingled admiration and impatience   his utterances
are those of a poet  not of a scientist  



jung s courageous recantation

as spokesman of the zurich group of psycho analysts  dr  jung has lately
protested against these arbitrary translations  which he calls freud s
 reductive method   6  in formulating a more scientific method of his own 
which he calls the  constructive method   jung reveals a change of views so
extensive as to suggest  on several points  almost a conversion to the ideas
that dr  morton prince expressed in 1910  as to the insecurity of the
psycho analytic ideas of symbolism  7  at that time  jung valiantly defended
the freudian preference for stereotyped meanings as against the principian
idea of highly variable meanings  8  now  in going to the other extreme from
freud s cipher like method  jung has succumbed to the attractions of that
other popular method  equally decried by his former master  the symbolical
method of joseph and daniel  9  but at least he has bravely called in
question views which he once espoused with exaggerated positiveness 

jung s principal amendment to the freudian dream analysis consists in
subjecting the literal implications of the established freudian symbols 
such as snakes and staircases  to a further  more allegorical mode of
treatment in which the sexual meaning is greatly altered  the evidence 
which freudians continually find in dreams  for a pre occupation concerning
infantile and sexual needs 10  is explained away  as merely incidental
reviewing of past experiences  in the attempt to solve problems of the
future by analogy with the past  in other ways also jung alters his views 
notably by following prince in explaining the dream on a broad biological
foundation  viewing it as part and parcel of the individual s life struggle 
yet it is difficult to see wherein the so called constructive method really
applies  to the concrete dream  those biological conceptions of which it
makes ostentation  the practical consideration of telling the patient what
is good for him  and of keeping sexuality in the background seems to
dominate the technique  6  the interpretations are no more accurate than
before  there is not much to choose between the reductive and the
constructive method from the standpoint of the application of logic 



the supposed language of dreams

these reductions and constructions of the psychoanalytic schools appear to
be rather favorite ways of guessing than rival scientific methods 
unquestionably  they must achieve a gratifying number of hits under the
easygoing conditions of the psycho analytic seance  this is obviously
satisfactory to medical practice  but the danger to psychological theory
lies in the temptation to overvalue the particular technique that seems to
bring about such successes  for instance  freud and jung  finding it
convenient to assume that the dreamer is attempting to express his latent
thoughts by the use of metaphors and figures of speech  have unfortunately
come to regard the behavior of the unconscious mind as if it were employing
a secret archaic code or language of dreams  according to freud  its symbols
have very concrete meanings  jung  more liberal  says they are only very
general  but both authors seem to abuse the language analogy as a guidance
in dream interpretation   that is why psycho analytic method today suggests
not only the free play of poetic invention  but the license of mystical
speculation 

if there is any present point in emerson s remark that  mysticism consists
in the mistake of an accidental and occasional symbol for an universal one  
then  in speaking to the psycho analyst  the psychologist should echo
emerson further  and say   let us have a little algebra instead of this
trite rhetoric   universal signs instead of these village symbols  and we
shall both be gainers   11 

the reason we shall need a little algebra  as it were  is that many
psycho analysts have fallen into confused ways of regarding their signs and
significations 

consider  for example  the reputed signs of the birth phantasy  as listed by
freud  12 

 a large number of dreams  often full of fear  which are concerned with
passing through narrow spaces or with staying in the water  are based upon
fancies about the embryonic life  about the sojourn in the mother s womb and
about the act of birth         again   there are dreams about landscapes and
localities in which the emphasis is laid upon the assurance   i have been
there before   in this case the locality is always the genital organ of the
mother  it can be asserted with such certainty of no other locality that one
has  been there before     

 what we should infer from the waking illusion of familiarity  which 
emerson said  almost every person confesses   on this basis  is too absurd
to contemplate  

statements like these  though far from syllogistic in form  are virtually
general propositions or laws to the effect that all dreams having the
designated earmarks or manifest content  possess additionally and
necessarily certain specified qualities in the latent content  in this case 
the meaning of birth phantasy  13 

freud and jung have stood sponsors for many such seemingly far fetched
interpretations   how do they come to be so sure of their ground 



examination of the language analogy 14 

let a represent the idea in the latent content and c the corresponding
 symbol  in the manifest content  suppose that in a number of cases a
correlation is observed between a  the antecedent latent idea  and c  its
consequent or sequential manifestation in the dream consciousness 
thereafter  the observer comes to interpret the re appearance of c in a
dream narrative as a sign of the presence of the affiliated idea a  in the
latent content   and  as thomas hobbes phrased the matter in 1651  the
oftener they have been observed in like connection  the less uncertain is
the sign  15  now this is precisely the way we come to recognize the verbal
signs of our mother tongue  and our confidence that a given speech c  is
significant of a meaning a   in the speaker s intent  is arrived at by
relying upon  if not consciously formulating  just such a causal connection 
where an existing language is concerned  this is a perfectly legitimate
tooling of thought   but in applying such inferences to a supposititious
language of dreams  psycho analysts are begging the question  as well as
running into other kinds of fallacy as to the powers of the unconscious 

the meanings and significations of dream items are not so simply made out as
in language   for one cannot readily make sure that the relationship or
affiliation between a and c has been observed in its purity  there is an
uncertainty coming from the possible interposition of a variable factor 
which may have vitiated the observation  as alfred sidgwick points out in
his  application of logic   10  so let us well consider the basis of any
inference of meaning in dreams  and how far the language analogy applies 



the sources of meaning

fundamentally  every dream  yours or mine  consists of certain more or less
clearly remembered images or ideas  and these are secondarily derived from
some mental disposition previously or coetaneously acting in the background 
as it were   i  e   persisting through its residual subliminal nervous
dispositions   this anterior phenomenon is properly called the primary idea
or image  the other  which appears  supraliminally  in the dream is called
the secondary image or idea  the dream is thus made up of collocations and
combinations of secondary images  to which is usually added a filling in of
fancy which may be called tertiary ideas   required  to find the primary
ideas and so  the relation of one idea to another  which is the measure of
 meaning  

each secondary or tertiary image  in the absence of any immediate stimulus
to account for it  may usually be traced back into a primary train of
thought left unfinished during the day  this is the conception of the
perseveration of the unadjusted  stated in 1891 by delage  in giving his
theory of dreams  17  its history runs back to thomas hobbes  and it has
been amplified lately by professor woodworth  to whom i am indebted for
unusually clean cut illustrations of the applicability of the theory to
dream life  the principle is a most important contribution to the study of
meaning in dreams 

more specifically  prince  through his text book on  the unconscious   is
the exponent of the idea that the elements of meaning reside in the primary
ideas and must be sought there by highly specific investigations in the
given case    the meaning is in the fringe of thought    the meaning of a
supraliminal image must be discovered in its relation to the subliminal
ideas clustering around it  this implies studying by association tests what
james called the psychic overtones  and what prince has  in his teaching 
called the unconscious settings of ideas  which determine meaning  18  care
must be taken to find the real determinants  and to set aside spurious dream
material  which is not always facilitated by the psycho analytic methods 

in order to show that one should not assume meanings by rule of thumb 
without investigations of this kind  prince has demonstrated a case in which
typical phallic symbols  in a phobia of bells and towers  had acquired their
emotional meanings  not through sexual analogies  as freudians would
suppose  but through actual contiguity experience with church bells and
belfry  quite apart from sexual matters  18  similarly  snakes  sticks 
circles do not necessarily carry the sexual meanings assumed by
psycho analysts  who are over influenced by the language analogy 



decisive value of context and apperception mass

to freudians such statements seem paradoxical  to say the least  but the
simple fact is that never is it correct to assume  as they do  a
transcendental connection between a symbol c and a signification a  as if
the unconscious mind disposed of ready made symbols of its own  barring
words used in their proper sense  and similar borrowings from waking habit 
the so called symbols in dreams are essentially impromptu fabrications  in
which the association is not a direct causal connection between a and c  but
a mediate association involving a third element  which psycho analysts
usually leave out of account 

an element of this kind  overlooked in the formulation of a supposedly
simple connection between cause a and effect c  is labeled hidden z  by
alfred sedgwick   the hidden z in this case is what james calls the
topic of thought  ebbinghaus the set of the mind  and others
apperception mass  in rhetoric it is familiar as context  it has an
important place in thought and speech   for example  when i utter the
phrase  pas de lieu rhone qne nous  the idea obtained is different according
to whether your language apperception mass is set for french or for english 
it may have happened that while i was uttering the french nonsense phrase
you were hearing it as the english saying   similarly  the traveler in egypt
may correctly apperceive the meaning of architectural forms of temples as
phallic  whereas it would be manifestly out of context to do so in
connection with churchly edifices of the gothic type  which do not represent
the generative powers of nature  as do the former 

conversely  the freudian disciple may apperceive  in error  a sexual meaning
in a dream  when the dreamer s mind contained no reference to this topic 
hence  the interpreter must make sure that his own apperception mass is
attuned to that of the dreamer in the given case  that is  one must be free
from apperceptive bias   one must reject all hastily formed causal laws to
the effect that c is the sign of a in every case  otherwise absurd
conclusions must result  as in freud s theory of the birth phantasies  for
the same  symbol  may proceed from entirely different significations
according to the set of the mind or apperception mass  the following analogy
of ebbinghaus puts the matter clearly   when a train enters a large station
there are many paths over which it might pass  but its actual path depends
on the position which was given to the switches immediately before the
train s arrival   19  that is why one needs to detect  experimentally  the
dream material that really represents the set of the mind  and thence the
significant relations called meaning 

in this connection  i published a year ago the dream of a child of six 
containing seemingly typical phallic symbols  20  not one of them could be
correlated with a sexual context  but every one was concretely shown to have
reached its position in the dream through the influence of an entirely
different set of the mind  it is  therefore  not safe to assume stereotyped
meanings in dreams 



metaphysical conceptions in psycho analysis

there are three reasons why psycho analysts do not more often encounter this
variable element  this hidden z  first  such dreams as they elect to deal
with  are mostly sexual   second  they do not apply the methods of
individual differences which have been made so familiar and so useful by
professor cattell in this country     thirdly  their type of culture leads
them to study the dream extensively rather than intensively and all the
while in apparent disregard of those conceptions of physiological psychology
which we now associate with the work of wundt  of ladd and of woodworth  and
with the psychopathology of prince 

    the writer s present psychophysiological theory of dreams was first
broached in public  at a series of meetings on the subject of individual
differences  held in honor of professor cattell  at columbia university  in
the department of psychology  in april  1914 

to be sure  jung s recent utterances before the psycho medical society of
london  demonstrate his dissatisfaction with the freudian conception of the
dream  but he is still far from those studies of specific mental and nervous
dispositions to which psychology has slowly come  and for which we now have
a tool in the shape of prince s conception of the neurogram  in
psycho analytic work a more vague use of  dream material  is preferred and
it is only by good luck that the real settings of ideas come into account 
jung  no less than freud  has forgotten that philosophy has become
mechanistic since descartes  21  famous year of 1637  and jung would throw
us back to the early seventeenth century  with his energic conception of the
libido  or the ur libido  now called horme and sometimes merely elan vital 
and this  fifty years after herbert spencer s tremendous emphasis on
specific studies in reflex action  22 

fontenelle  the wittiest of cartesians  writing in 1686  gives us a classic
tableau of this sort of speculative temper    23  he pictures worthies like
pythagoras  heraclitus  empedocles  as being invited to witness lulli s
opera  phaeton   at the paris odeon   in characteristic fashion  each in
turn tries to explain the spectacular aerial flight of the actor in the
title role  from the floor of the stage to the ceiling  one says  that
phaeton is able to fly by the potency of certain numbers of which he is
composed  another  that a secret virtue carries him aloft  still another 
that phaeton travels through the air because he abhors to leave a vacuum in
the upper corner of the stage  and so on  with a hundred and one
speculations which  as fontenelle remarks  should have ruined the reputation
of antiquity   finally  he pictures descartes coming along and saying   this
actor is able to rise from the floor because he hangs by a cord  at the
other end of which is a counterpoise  heavier than he  which is descending  
this is mechanistic       if freud and jung had been of the party  can it be
doubted that the one would have ascribed phaeton s aviation to a
wish fulfilment of the flying dream type  derived from a reminiscence of
erotic motion pleasure 24  in childhood  or that jung  for his part  would
have said phaeton was levitated by the energic force of a sublimation of the
ur libido  alias elan vital  alias horme 

     

varieties of dream interpretations

let me illustrate these points of criticism of the psychoanalytic methods 
by the analysis of a sample dream  speaking first as the dreamer giving the
simple narrative  next as freud applying the reductive method  then as jung
employing the constructive method  and finally explaining the dream  as i
would myself prefer  by the use of what i may call the reconstitutive
method   the dream itself  for reasons  that will be obvious  i call the
 scratch reflex dream  

 i was looking down upon a microscope from the right side of the lens tube 
and could see  laid upon the stage  a glass slide  under the cover glass  in
place of an ordinary specimen  there was supposed to be a new reflex   one
of those discovered by my friend the neurologist  dr  x   whose scrawly
handwriting i recognized on the label   i was anxiously trying to decipher
what he had written  and was having the same trouble with it that i had
experienced in real life with the record of some of his dreams  which i had
interpreted successfully  the handwriting on the label  as i gazed  appeared
less and less like script and more like disconnected  scratchy lines or
hachures  owing to the formation of lacunae in the inky traces  it became
scratchier and scratchier as i wakened  on coming to my senses        

 that is enough   we hear dr  freud saying   it is obvious what kind of
reflex action you have in mind   the word  slide  is of a punning nature 
and in conjunction with the easy moveability of the microscope barrel
suggests a meaning akin to that of dreams of skating and sliding  which are
usually sexual   from the standpoint of symbolics  the geometric forms and
relative positions of cover glass and microscope suggest allusions to the
generative powers of nature  like the phallicism of the ancient egyptian
religion  whose sacred emblems of sexual objects still confront the explorer
and the tourist   here  the  stage  of the microscope refers obviously to
the theatre  so often the scene of exhibitionistic activities  your dream
represents the male and the female principles in such a manner that it must
mean a survival of infantile curiosity related to the mystery of parenthood 
sir  this proves your libido to have been fixated at the  voyeur 
level   25 

 not so fast   says dr  jung  while the dreamer remains nonplussed at the
foregoing example of the reductive method    it is not good for the health
to overvalue the past  as my colleague does   nous avons change tout cela 
in zurich   your curiosity  according to the constructive method  is a
demand for satisfaction in new and better ways than those of infancy  i will
prove this to be so  by an investigation of the dream material  this dr  x  
what of him and his handwriting  

the dreamer then explains that dr  x  had consented to have his dreams
analyzed  and that the outcome had been the uncovering of his secret
intention to be married  the dreamer also states that dr  x  had written
some very original papers on periosteal reflexes 

 ah   says dr  jung  as it were  making quotations from his own writings 
 as indicated in italics   one has only to hear this dream material in order
to understand at once that the dream is not so much the fulfilment of
infantile desires as it is the expression of biological duties hitherto
neglected because of       infantilism   6   to be sure these are sexual
objects that you are looking at in the dream  as freud would have it  but
your interest in them is not so primitive as it would seem  for do you not 
symbolically speaking   look down upon  them in your fancy  and moreover 
since you are looking at these emblems of parental union  from the right
side   does it not therefore mean that you are contemplating something
legitimate  namely  marriage on your own account   not exhibitionism on the
part of others   one infers you wish to put away childish sex curiosity and
fulfil your destiny as a parent  in this case symbolical value  not concrete
value must be attached to the sexual phantasy  

at this point  the dreamer makes free to admit that he is a bachelor  and
that he would not be averse to marriage if he could manage to take a wife
and at the same time keep up his research work 

 precisely   dr  jung might say  rapidly turning these clues to account 
 your interest in future advancement is clearly reflected in your anxiety to
decipher the handwriting of dr  x   with whom you have identified yourself 
you desire to emulate his scientific achievements  his published work on
reflexes excites your ambition   the handwriting on the label  which
perplexes you  is an allusion not only to his authorship but to the
difficulties in the way of your own contribution to the science of dream
interpretation  by imitating dr  x s triumph you wish to make your marriage
possible  your horme or elan vital is pushing you to evolve new and higher
forms of the libido   you are sublimating   26 



the reconstitutive method

 no  gentlemen   the dreamer replies at last   your reductions and your
constructions are too easy going  too conjectural  too much dominated by
prepossessions and the  will to interpret   the alleged sources or
determinants for this dream may or may not have played the parts you assign
to them  the mystery of the matter must remain inscrutable   but what your
methods  so plausible in effect  certainly do show is how easy it may be to
confabulate an explanation that goes no deeper than a phrenological reading
of cranial bumps or than a seance in the cabinet of a palmist  let us turn
away from all this and consider what really happened  as by the grace of
luck i can bear witness   permit me to reconstitute the dream as an actual
event  by the employment of certain clues which i was about to give when the
ready made symbolism of dr  freud was interposed  



outline of the reconstitution

inasmuch as the dream is one of my own  i may be permitted to testify that
it was unmistakably connected with a scratching sensation at my ear  as i
distinctly perceived on awaking  this stimulation proceeded obviously from a
mouse  which i had time to observe in close proximity  as it remained
perched on the bedclothes  until my own startled movements put it to flight 
tracing the stimulation from this external source  i shall try to maintain
the following interpretation   

first  that the dream is an associative reaction to the sensation of
scratching  in the form of evocations of imagery related in experience to
this sensory element  and that the dream process was a part of the
perception  or recognition or apperception of the stimulus 

second  that this reaction  let us name it apperception of the stimulus  
took place slowly and imperfectly  owing to the state of sleep  so that the
reaction was  to begin with  only remotely relevant to the stimulus  but
improved in relevancy with successive evocations  until the mental
representation closely approximated the character of the stimulus 

third  that in and among the secondary images 27  so evoked  incidental
processes of thought  tertiary compoundings of these images  were
immediately set up  the selection and re arrangement of these secondary and
tertiary features  constituting the revelation of a significant state of
mind which had preceded the dream 

specifically  in addition to the mental response to the external stimulus 
there was a phantasy representing an imaginary wish fulfilment  namely the
desire to forsake the study of histology  with the eye straining search
through the microscope  in favor of the study of reflex action or
reflexology 

my contention is that this blended response 28  to a physical and to a
psychic cue arose very naturally and simply out of a single context 
prepared by events of the night before  and i would show that by comparing
the phantasy with this context  it is possible to reconstitute the dream in
a way that amounts to a refutation of the two other interpretations  which i
have essayed in accordance with the methods of freud and of jung 
respectively 



the real context of the dream

our constant consideration should be for the fact  emphasized by william
james  that there is  no recall without a cue   29  here we have a
scratching sensation provoked by a mouse as the immediate and demonstrated
cue   the images that followed in serial response  proved upon investigation
to have been wholly derived from a certain conversation with dr  x   the
night before   the subject had been reflex action and especially the
scratch reflex of the guinea pig 30  as investigated by sherrington  we had
discussed also the attempts of other authors to explain the higher mental
functions in terms of reflex action   31   my own preference for such
studies as applied to the explanation of dreams had been touched upon  this
preference had in turn been contrasted with the fact that i was at the time
of the dream called upon to spend much time studying histological specimens
through the microscope  incidentally  i told him that this was bad for my
eyes  and likewise  i had complained that his dreams were not written out
clearly enough to suit my purpose to study them carefully  such interest had
been aroused in the subject of reflexology  that dr  x  and i had stayed up
late that night discussing it 

a study of the dream in the light of these facts will show how perfectly the
dreaming mind appears to have  taken advantage of  them  in reality
following cues along the lines of least resistance 



the dream as a response to a cue

the scratch reflex dream is then to be reconstituted first of all as a
memory reaction determined by factors of recency  frequency and intensity in
the dreamer s experience  the operation of these factors determines the
evocation of a specific context or apperception mass  namely the
conversation in question  whose affinity with the external stimulus
 scratching  is now made evident   the course of events can be followed so
concretely as to permit the logical exclusion of other supposed
determinants  confining the explanation as stated  the principle of the
parsimony of causes is here applied   i contend that the dream is neither an
infantile nor a sexual wish fulfilment  all plausible analogies to the
contrary notwithstanding  should anyone wish to urge the more remote
interpretations which i first manufactured  then the burden of proof rests
with him  and no proof is conclusive that rests on mere precedent or on mere
reasoning by analogy   the only psychological proof of an interpretation is
fundamentally the ability of the interpreter to reconstitute the dream
beyond peradventure  this i propose to accomplish more in detail  showing
the dream to be a reaction to specific cues  through a process of
trial and error  and to a limited degree  of trial and success 



trial percepts

consider the sequence of events   the dream pictures are all related  at
least individually  to the conversation in question   microscope  slide 
reflex and  scratchiness  are all so many pictures jig sawed out from this
very context or apperception mass  the scratching sensation  we must
suppose  evoked these pictures serially  in the order stated  if these
images were what the psychologist calls  trial percepts   we would expect
from them just what we do find  namely  an increasing degree of
correspondence  relevancy  between the stimulus idea and the images  as they
appear  33  precisely so  the images of microscope  slide  reflex and
scratchy handwriting  as they successively come into focus  conform more and
more to the nature of the stimulus  until the approximation ends in the idea
of an all absorbing interest in  scratchy  marks  this visual image hardly
reaches precision before it becomes translated and transposed to the tactile
field of my ear  smoothly  as if it were one magic lantern view dissolving
into another  in fine  the presentation of each image in the dream amounts
to a groping effort of the dreamer s nervous system to find a proper
experiential equivalent for the arriving stimulus  it is a trial and error
method of perceiving or apperceiving a stimulus by marshelling associated
ideas  in this case they are serially evoked   what might be called  oniric
echelon    in other cases the trial apperceptions are blended smoothly
 oniric fusion  or heaped together in rough and tumble fashion  a kind of
confusion  conveniently called  oniric entassement   which testifies
sufficiently to the failures of the unconscious t o dispose smoothly of
arriving excitations  and so emphasizes  the theory of trial and error  as
applied to dreams 



apperceptive delay in trial and error process

the delay in arriving at the correct apperception of the stimulus may be
referred to as  finding time  or simply as apperceptive delay  it represents
time occupied with the reproduction of erroneous apperceptive
images  apperceptive errors   meanwhile the stimulus idea  that mental
element most closely connected with the original stimulus  is operating
somewhere in the brain  determining the evocation of the secondary images
that appear in the dream  33  this wire pulling is done in the dark  the
primary stimulus idea is not itself imaged  at first  neither is the context
or apperception mass which meets it half way  that is  becomes conjoined
with the stimulus idea  indeed  the images that come into the dream are only
emerging peaks of a submerged island of memory   what shall emerge is
determined by the interplay of stimulus idea and apperception mass  below
the level of consciousness   a and z are working together  

the particular  island of memory  in this case  was an impression of the
talk with dr  x   about histology  reflexology and dream interpretation  it
remained subliminal  evidently  except so far as portions of it were raised
above the threshold by the reproductive energy of the stimulus of
scratching   necessarily  a process of imageless thought had taken place 
whereby the conversation was brought into play as a sub excited
apperception mass or setting of ideas for the stimulus idea  furthermore 
another process of imageless thought must have taken place whereby the
secondary images being raised into consciousness attained to their
arrangement as a wish phantasy  without that preliminary tuning up which the
principal cue  scratching  called forth  on its own account  this remains to
be explained 



the incidental wish fulfilment

the dream  viewed as a mere wish fulfilment  is plainly a successful
allegory   while the action of the principal cue or immediate stimulus had
served to evoke the apperception mass or context out of which this
wish phantasy was constructed  at the same moment  there was an ulterior
influence at work  dictating a process of re arrangement of the secondary
images  so as to give expression to my preference for reflexology as against
histology   besides  the ground appears to have already been so well
prepared that we can readily explain the absence of evident signs of
trial and error  for in dreaming that i look away from the microscope and
turn with intensive interest to the reflex  i was still only giving effect
to a preference which had already attached the emotions of liking and
dislike  to these two objects of thought  respectively  the creative fancy
in this instance  what hobbes 34  called the fiction of the mind  has a very
simple task to work upon  achieving the imaginary satisfaction of unadjusted
feelings regarding the mental conflict between histology and reflexology 
the microscope is accordingly reproduced naively with an  endeavor fromward 
attached to it  and likewise the reflex  with an  endeavor toward  it    
thus is the expression completed of a wish which had been partially
outspoken in the conversation with dr  x 

    hobbes   leviathan   cap  vi    these small beginnings of motion  within
the body of man  before they appear in walking  speaking  striking  and
other visible actions  are commonly called endeavour   this endeavour   when
it is toward something which causes it  is called appetite  or desire       
and when the endeavour is fromward something  it is generally called
averston   these words appetite and aversion  we have from the latins  and
they both of them signify the motions  one of approaching  the other of
retiring   so do also the greek words for the same  which are horme and
aphorme  

in this connection  i beg leave to suggest that these greek terms are more
usefully applied to dreams and to the passions in general  in their
uncomplicated primitive sense  rather than in the new way that dr  c  g 
jung is suggesting for horme  as a companion word for libido or for elan
vital  for several years  i have found it useful to employ the coined
adjectives hormetic and aphormetic to characterize the tendencies fromward
or toward  as exhibited in the association of ideas  for example  in the
scratch reflex dream  there is shown an aphormetic tendency regarding the
microscope and a hormetic tendency regarding the reflex 

while the external physical stimulus  scratching  must be thought of as
being represented dynamically somewhere in the arrival platforms of the
brain  it is necessary to think of the internal psychic stimulus  or wish 
as existing in the form of facilitations  or ready made connections of ideas
and motives  as it were awaiting  in a state of mobilization  the proper
signal to discharge into consciousness  the expression of the wish thus
became accessory to the apperception of the principal cue   the accessory
wish cue wrought its effect coetaneously  during the apperceptive delay 

granted the correctness of this explanation  does it not clearly conform to
the statement of emerson that  dreams are the maturation often of opinions
not consciously carried out to statements  but whereof we already possessed
the elements     

    emerson  r  w    lectures and biographical sketches   vol  x  complete
works  p  8  houghton  mifflin   company  1904 



the perseveration of the unadjusted

in the foregoing words of emerson  there is brought to bear on dreams an
energic conception of mind action similar to that which hobbes had developed
in his leviathan in 1651  the latter  by analogy with conceptions of
mechanical inertia new in his time  had compared the persevering effect of
nervous stimuli to the continued agitation of waves of the sea after a

the delage woodworth conception that dreams are due to persevering effects
of unadjusted mental elements is not  therefore  entirely novel  but is
itself a maturing of opinions which have been more or less loosely
entertained by writers on dreams since hobbes first formulated the modern
doctrine of the association of ideas   not to go back any further  the
fertility of the conception of the  perseveration of the unadjusted  has
been emphasized in my mind by illustrations obtained by an extended study of
the dreams of normal people  and notably  by the agreement of my conclusions
with those of professor woodworth and of dr  morton prince   and i am led to
believe that a development of this conception should harmonize with accepted
principles of psychology  normal and abnormal  as formulated in ladd and
woodworth s text book  and in prince s  the unconscious  

greater precision must be conferred upon this conception by showing
specifically in what ways  and by what associative mechanisms  the
persevering and unadjusted stimuli evoke the dream images  granting that
unadjusted stimuli persist in their effects upon dream life  or in other
terms  that primary stimulus ideas may evoke secondary dream images  and so
on unto the third and fourth  generations   then  in what manner does the
process go on or come to an end  the answer to this question is an eminently
practical one  to which psycho analysis has already brought the complication
of its own still immature formulation of ab reaction and of catharsis  35 
the matter still requires further study  in particular  it is necessary to
formulate  through specific examples  a conception which shall be the
pendant or complement of the theory of the perseveration of the unadjusted 
and which i will call the  resolution of the unadjusted  

already  i have taken the preliminary steps in this direction by adopting
the physiological conception of trial percepts and applying it to dream
interpretation   as a result  i have come to regard the successive
evocations of imagery in the dream and even their reciprocal adaptations
under the influence of creative fancy  as being trial apperceptions or
attempted responses to one or more cues  either sensory or psychic 



resolution of the unadjusted

the operation of any cue  waking or sleeping  implies the endeavor of the
organism to provide a channel of escapement for the nervous excitation
emanating from the stimulus  the best channels  of course  are furnished by
those neurograms  or vestiges of previous experience  originally
constellated with the stimulus idea  indeed  as in the scratch reflex dream 
we find that the stimulus does immediately tend to pass into such channels 
but the same example shows that it takes time for the excitation to raise
into consciousness the image most closely related to  or agglutinated with 
the stimulus  this being  no doubt  due to the passive inertia in the
corresponding neurogram  meantime  during the apperceptive delay  the energy
spills over into less appropriate neurograms  albeit they are more quickly
mobilized  with the result of evoking bizarre imagery  what i have called
trial apperceptions  36  sometimes  too  this is adequate to meet the
situation  for the resolution of the unadjusted is complete so soon as the
stimulus is drained off  re distributed and dynamically absorbed  as in the
case of mechanical  lost motion   a useful and intelligent solution is by no
means requisite  mere rambling often suffices 

yet in sleep the process of trial and error may often result in highly
constructive resolutions  as in what the french call reve utile  this is
especially true in case the unadjusted cues are highly persistent psychic
stimuli   here  the excitation rises instead of seeming to wear down and can
be followed in its working up  through trial and error  to the elaboration
of a more or less logical response to the demands of the mental
situation   after which  the excitation appears to trouble the sleeper no
further  unfortunately  time does not permit my giving the examples i would
like of the varieties of resolutions in dreams  with their every degree of
relevancy and irrelevancy  of a propos and bizarrerie  instead  i will
briefly dwell on a suggestive example of mental adjustment to specific cues 
in the waking state 

a japanese poetess is asked to combine into one word picture the ideas of a
triangle  of a square and of a circle  after a short pause  taken up  as we
may believe  by what ernst mach calls the conflict of ideas  and which i
think of as imageless trials and errors  the poetess evolves the following
phantasy   detaching one corner of the mosquito netting  lo  i behold the
moon   this resolution left nothing to be desired 

all resolutions of problems  of riddles  of charades  and  according to my
experience  most dreams if not all  represent a trial and error method of
working out a reconciliation among unadjusted mental tendencies  the goal of
which is illustrated by the case of the japanese poetess  dreams  however 
usually exhibit only the preliminary efforts  those are hidden in this
example  which stands midway between the severe reasoning of euclid and the
free play of a dreamer s response to the reproductive tendencies playing
upon his memory 

as to the theory of the resolution of the unadjusted  i must resist the
temptation to dwell on its many attractive phases  in bringing this
discussion to a close   one of its neglected aspects  however  may be
indicated within the present context  by remarking upon the feeling of
incompleteness that would at this stage  be left in the mind of the hearer 
if i should make an end  abruptly  like a phonograph stopped in the middle
of a tune   my discourse would inevitably be left at loose ends  owing to
the persistency of a number of questions which have been raised  agitated 
but not fully set at rest  these would continue to act as so many persisting
and unadjusted stimulus ideas  these are embodied in the feeling we now
have  that a summary should be made of what has gone before concerning the
scratch reflex dream and the various methods of interpreting it  thus  our
 unfinished feeling  represents in itself an obscure demand for a resolution
of the unadjusted  it corresponds to that inner compulsion which operates
upon the imperfect consciousness of the dreamer  or upon the mentality of
any person seeking the solution of a problem or  perplex   either asleep  or
awake  as i trust you all still remain  the present demand for the
resolution of the unadjusted must be met without going deeper into the
theory of the matter  37 



the reconstitution summarized

accordingly  i will now point out the fact that the analysis of the
scratch reflex dream has been carried to the stage where the dream stands
reconstituted as follows   

it is an attempt of the nervous mechanism to resolve a specific sensory
stimulus idea  a  by the discharge of nervous energy into a previously
prepared or  facilitated  set of the mind or context  hidden z   this  in
the premises  happened to possess associative affinity for the stimulus  and
was therefore  by the same token  chosen  i  e   brought into play  as a
spillway for the stimulus  the secondary images  c  in the dream  evoked by
the derivation of excitement through the channels of the given context
 conversation with dr  x   are explained as forming  in the order of their
appearance   a chain of apperceptive pictures  or trial and error series 
whose links or steps approximate gradually to the characteristic features of
the primary stimulus idea  scratching sensation   but while regarding this
immediate influence as the principal cue to memory  calling it a   we must
admit an ulterior influence or motive power  itself in the nature of an
accessory cue  namely a wish  b   revived along with the memory of the
conversation   this wish  to substitute reflexology for histology 
contributes a special configuration or phantastic  wishful arrangement to
the group of successive trial apperceptions called forth by the physical
stimulus  a   the corresponding motives of desire and of aversion 
 concisely pictured as positive interest in the reflex and disinterest in
the microscope   although seeming to spring out of the system of memories
 z   which form the context  are none the less separate from it as
self acting sources of stimulus  as a wish apart from the mere brute memory
of the talk about reflexes  the wish is thus an accessory cue  b  operating
in conjunction with the external stimulus  although revived by the energy of
the latter  in this case  the imaginary wish fulfilment achieves an
immediate  though limited  success   correspondingly  it does not exhibit on
its own account the feature of trial and error which we have learnt to
recognize in the working of the unadjusted sensory stimulus  scratching  

while this dream does not exemplify trial and error processes in response to
a psychic cue  it is proper to state that the same mechanism can be
demonstrated in the more purely psychic dreams  as well as in this one 
wherein we have followed the trial apperceptions of a stimulus  from their
incipience  to the point of awaking to a conscious recognition of the source
of excitation  moreover  by a more delicate and intricate use of the
reconstitutive method it is possible to discover the stimulus ideas in those
cases where the dreamer is not able to testify to their character  as i was
in this simple instance  purposely chosen  i may add  to outline the method
in its simplest aspect 

according to the reconstitutive method  a dream is sufficiently interpreted
and explained by having formulated the operation of the several specific
factors  as in the foregoing example  that is  no preconceptions as to
content or meaning or transcendental symbols are imported into this sort of
purely mechanistic interpretation 



the psycho analytic dilemma

unfortunately  the psycho analyst  if he applies the current conceptions of
symbolism  may well doubt whether the reconstitution has gone far enough 
and whether all the stimulus ideas  or all the wish factors have been found 
this is because he does not make it a rule to check up his guesses as to
meaning  by specific investigations of the settings of ideas  by
auscultating the so called  fringe of thought   or by laying out crucial
tests for his own hypothesis in the given case  such methods  which belong
no less to general psychopathology than to the reconstitutive method  do not
leave one free to argue from analogy  a privilege which most psycho analysts
enjoy  and have been known to abuse  as freud and jung themselves have done 

it follows that one might properly expect the psychoanalyst to dwell
especially upon the seemingly phallic  symbols  in the scratch reflex dream 
which could be made out in the geometrical features of the microscope and
cover glass  he would thus  as i have shown  be led to unearth a sexual
motive  which might be a mare s nest  this searching for sexual symbolism on
a purely a priori basis  when no evidence internal or external  and no real
clues to a sex idea exist  may become a mere obsession  a habit of
interpretation which is not scientific at all   unable to distinguish the
subconscious operation of a non sexual context  from that of the more
familiar sexual context  the interpreter is at the mercy of superficial
resemblances between the properties of the dream objects and those of the
well known sexual symbols   the ambiguity which has resulted from this
condition of affairs  maintains the psychoanalytic dilemma  that of not
knowing when to stop in apperceiving sexual allusions  indeed  it is part of
the interpretative policy of psycho analysts not to exclude sexual meanings 
in case of doubt  but rather to take the sexual sense for granted 

how far this policy has been carried may perhaps be suggested by the
following instance   a well known physiological psychologist  attempting to
show the absurdity of extreme sexual interpretations  remarked to a
well known psycho analyst that even the geometry of euclid would  according
to the methods under criticism  be open to the imputation of sexual motive 
to this the psycho analyst replied that he did not feel at all sure that
euclid might not have been inspired to write his geometry by the sexual
ideas which men have  from time immemorial  embodied in circles and
triangles and diameters   this instance  be it said  implies no criticism of
psycho analysis beyond the fact that its conception of symbols in dreams and
elsewhere is transcendental and historical rather than truly psychological
as it purports to be  a state of opinion which the use of the reconstitutive
method is calculated to correct 

the difference between the psycho analytic methods and the reconstitutive
method  in a given case  is that the former assume the validity of sexual
symbolism unless it can positively be proved absent  which is rarely
attempted  whereas  the reconstitutive method assumes no symbolism and no
meaning to be present in the mind of the dreamer except as the probability
can be demonstrated by specific investigations and inferences as to the
interplay of cues and contexts or apperception masses  moreover  a special
technique is used to study the  fringe   1 

reverting for a moment to the sexual interpretations of the scratch reflex
dream that i manufactured by applying the freudian ready made symbolism 
and  again  by imitating the constructive fancy of jung  they must both be
judged as having no merit beyond  perhaps  that of coinciding with inherent
probabilities in the premises  that is  what they purport to reveal might be
made out of whole cloth to fit almost any unmarried man  barring a few
individual adaptations  to suit the known circumstances of the dreamer  as
these interpretations stand  they do not fit the psychogenesis of the dream 
they are rank confabulations on my part  yet they appear to hold water 
psychoanalytically 

enough has been said to suggest  i think  that while dr  freud may be
honored as the father of dream analysis  with dr  jung as its foster father 
yet  to neither of these gentlemen of psycho analytic fame should be
conceded the right to bring up the  child    that is a task for the
psychologist  because he can afford to go deeper into normal processes than
has so far been possible in psycho analytic practice   but he must take
pains to employ those scientific methods which comport the rigorous
application of logic even to the vagaries of dreams  and the rejection of
the argument from mere authority  of such methods  the exemplars are to be
found only among those writers who today are worthily carrying forward the
mechanistic traditions originated by descartes   in so far as
psycho analysts depart from these traditions and  relying on the authority
of their leaders  follow them into metaphysical speculations about the
libido  and transcendental notions of symbolism  they are wandering on
ground full of pitfalls to common sense 



summary

the question here considered is whether dream interpretations shall
represent the state of the dreamer s mind or the mere fancy of the
interpreter  criticism is directed at the aprioristic and oftentimes
hit or miss practices of the vienna and zurich schools of psycho analysis 

for illustration  a simple dream is interpreted by the current methods of
psycho analysis  first  according to the  reductive method  of freud  it is
made out as symbolizing an infantile and sexual wish fulfilment  expressing
a  voyeur  component of the libido   secondly  the dream is re interpreted
by jung s  constructive method  so as to gloss over the gross freudian
phallicism   it is now made to mean that the dreamer is impelled to higher
biological duties  namely marriage and professional success 

the plausibility of these interpretations once shown  they are next proved
to be wide of the mark  by the fact that the dream can be more adequately
accounted for in another way  i  e   by a proposed  reconstitutive method  
this method aims to  reconstitute  the dream thought  both imaged and
imageless  by tracing the wave of nervous excitation from its origin in
primary stimulus ideas  sensory or psychic  through a specific
apperception mass into a consequently derived system of secondary images 
which form the manifest dream content  the derivation of the secondary
images must be concretely followed through the authenticated channels of
association  not assumed on the basis of  fixed symbolism   or any other a
priori conception 

the reconstitution of this particular dream illustrates the reductio ad
absurdum of the two previous psycho analytic  solutions   the fact that
either of them would apparently have satisfied the demands of the problem 
is characterized as an artifact evolved through the interpreter s deliberate
confabulation and forcing of analogy  thus causing the scant data of the
dream to fall into artificial agreement with the preconceived notions of the
vienna and zurich schools  respectively   as a guarantee of scientific
accuracy  it is urged that the interpreter trace the process of imageless
thought  woodworth  back of the dream  and  in particular  seek the meaning
in the unconscious settings of ideas  prince   the reconstitutive method is
the extension of these two formulations from normal and abnormal psychology
into the field of dream analysis  through the study of individual
differences  cattell  and the application of logic  alfred sidgwick  

it is not denied that freud s dream theories serve very well to interpret a
considerable proportion of common dreams  but the psycho analytic technique
embodies a fallacious assumption that there is a transcendental symbolizing
activity in the unconscious  as it were a language of dreams  this gives
rise to a biased  will to interpret    the alleged meaning may thus often be
the work of the interpreter s mind although not that in the dreamer s mind 

the reconstitutive method brings into relief the trial and error character
of the dreaming process   the organism as attempting the physiological
resolution of persisting and unadjusted stimulus ideas  psychologically
speaking  the images evoked in the dream are called trial percepts or trial
apperceptions of the stimulus ideas  corresponding more or less closely to
the latter  not through analogy necessarily  but through mere contiguity  as
the case may be 

in certain cases  the erroneous apperceptions are observed to form a series
of approximations to the correct apprehension of one of the stimulus ideas
at a time   in other cases  the apperceptive errors may take the form of a
blended reaction to two or more cues  more or less perfectly achieved 

these mechanisms  when they go wrong  as they often do  produce the
incoherency and bizarrerie of the dream  but they do not preclude a
significant reconstitution of the process of which the dream is a
by product  such reconstitutions require to be validated by specific tests
and inferences  of such logical character as to bear comparison with the
methodology of other sciences  the psychoanalytic arguments from analogy 
from precedent and from authority are alike to be rejected

36   spencer s conception of the escapement of nervous excitation is
fundamental in connection with the dream theory here sketched  see the
essays on laughter and on music  also many passages in the synthetic
philosophy  biology  psychology   this conception is not to be confused with
janet s idea of  derivation   as stated in  obsessions et psychasthenie  
the present formulation of the meaning of  apperceptive delay  in dreaming
is based on the neurographic hypothesis    the unconscious   chapt  v    and
may be more precisely stated as follows   

in the given instance  the original or primary neurogram possessed a certain
passive inertia in responding to the stimulus  and it took a relatively long
time for the excitation to raise the neurogic tonus of this primary
neurogram so as to attain the level requisite for conscious imagination  but
it was otherwise with the secondary or sequential neurograms  whose inertia
had already been overcome by the facilitation  bahnung  of the recent
conversation about scratch reflexes  for these neurograms to flash their
imaged  conscious  equivalents into the dream thought  it was enough that
there should be a slight spill over of excitation from the original
neurogram 

many examples could be cited from dreams  drowsy states and lapses of
thought  showing the ways in which sequential neurograms produce trial
apperceptions  pending the final revelation  through consciousness  of the
original neurogram   the phenomenon of mental groping  here alluded to  is
familiar in certain aspects  but  as an explanation of cryptic dreams  has
not received the recognition that it deserves  hence  the trial and error
theory of dreams 

37    perplex   neologism of the writer  used to indicate a phenomenon
frequent in both normal and psychopathic subjects  to wit  a group of
delimitable stimulus ideas  persisting as such  and unadjusted  a complex of
persisting and unadjusted stimulus ideas  demanding resolution  not the same
as  complex  in psycho analysis  cf  prince s definitions of the varieties
of complexes   the unconscious   



a case of possession

by donald fraser  m  d   glasgow

the demonaic possession of the middle ages and of times nearer to our own
was largely hysterical in character  and generally occurred in epidemics 

it was associated with the more superstitious and emotional side of
religious beliefs  where a real hell fire and a personal devil with
attendant angels or demons were believed in  and feared  much more intensely
and widely than they are today even amongst the ignorant and superstitious 
while suggestion and contagion played a large part in its spread  as it did
in that other and more hateful form of it known as witchcraft 

esquirol who wrote clearly about it in his  maladies mentales  under the
heading of  demonomania   1  spoke of it as being propagated  by contagion 
and by the force of imitation   this was illustrated in the epidemic of
loudun  amongst others referred to by him   this epidemic spread to
neighbouring towns menaced all the high languedoc  but was arrested by the
wisdom of a bishop  who did this by depriving the movement of its marvellous
elements  in this epidemic form it was in its bodily and mental
manifestations really hysteria with characteristic stigmata and convulsions 
an excellent example of this religious hysteria was presented as recently as
1857 in an epidemic at morzines in upper savoy   it began with two little
girls  pious and precocious  who had convulsive attacks  it spread to other
children and then to adults   amongst the younger of those affected 
ecstasy  catalepsy  and somnambulism were seen  and later  convulsions only 
convulsive attacks returned several times a day   an attack usually began
with yawning  restless movements  the aspects of fear passing into fury with
violent and impulsive movements  with vociferations and cries that they were
lost souls in hell  the mouth piece of the devil  etc  these attacks would
last from ten minutes to half an hour  a feature of this epidemic was the
absence of coarse and erotic speech or gestures   between the convulsions
the victims were restless  idle and inattentive  being altered in character
for the worse  in our day such epidemics are represented  though in tamer
fashion  by revivalism in its more noisy and extravagant eruptions  at all
times  even when such manifestations are not much if at all out of harmony
with ordinary religious feeling and action  there is a tendency to
pathological conditions   often its subjects  in the words of professor
james 2   carry away a feeling of its being a miracle rather than a natural
process  voices are often heard  lights seen  or visions witnessed 
automatic motor phenomena occur  and it always seems after the surrender of
the personal will as if an extraneous higher power had flooded in and taken
possession   these are some of the more striking phenomena of mysticism  and
are also largely pathological being amongst the major symptoms of hysteria 
the history and course of our case illustrated very well this mixed
condition   it has been pointed out that the ecstasies  trances  etc   of
the mystic  while essentially pathological  have the evil effects of such
morbid manifestations modified or largely neutralized by the idealism behind
them  by that measure of true religious faith and feeling which dominates
the whole process in the case at least of the higher mystics  the ore may be
rough and very mixed  but the precious metal is there also  as it was in our
patient  though the divine influence for which she craved was perverted into
that of the  evil one   in the individual cases described by esquirol we
recognize a more profound mental disturbance than is shown in the epidemic
or hysterical variety   we indeed see many similar cases in our asylums
though we generally speak of them as religious melancholics rather than as
demonomaniacs   in such cases recovery is slow or may not occur  the patient
passing into a state of chronic mania  or of dementia   there are other
cases where the religious emotions and ideals are completely subordinated to
or become identified with feelings of fear or remorse  the result of fixed
ideas of a shameful  distressing or frightsome character  a good example of
this condition though essentially hysterical in its nature  is detailed by
pierre janet  3  the patient  a neurotic  respectable business man
thirty three years of age  a good husband and father  on his return from a
business journey of some weeks  duration is found to have become depressed
and taciturn  and as the days pass his melancholy deepens  at first he would
not speak  but soon when he wished to speak could not  making vain attempts
at articulation   under the influence of medical ideas suggested to him his
symptoms simulate first diabetes next heart disease and his prostration
becomes profound  by and bye he passes into a state only to be described as
acute demonomania marked by maniacal outbreaks in which he cried out and
blasphemed  lamenting in quieter intervals his powerlessness to resist the
devil who was  he believed  actually not figuratively within him  who spoke
and blasphemed through him  prevented him sleeping  etc   after some months
he was sent to the salpetriere where he came under the observation of
charcot and pierre janet   he was cured by means of suggestion by the
latter  who also ascertained by his methods that the illness was the result
of remorse for an offence committed during the business journey which
preceded the outbreak

in many ways our case differs from cases of this type   an important
difference was in the intermittent character of the symptoms  for a period
of two years the patient alternated between a condition of acute misery from
the delusion that the evil one had entered into her body  and one of
apparent sanity  at the end of two years she was dismissed cured  and has
remained well for several years   she differed also in the absence of
blasphemous  extravagant or obscene speech or action  the devil never at any
time used her as the mouthpiece for devilish words or thoughts   he was
there  and as she insisted  in bodily form within her  making her intensely
miserable by his presence  and with the feeling that she was cast away from
 grace  and the privileges of the religious life  nor were there  as in the
case above referred to shameful or remorseful complexes at the root of her
mental condition  in presenting the facts of the case  names and special
marks of identification have been altered 

mrs  a   a widow  aged fifty two years  was admitted to the paisley district
asylum in 1910 with a history of having suffered for a month previously from
mental depression said to be due to distressing delusions of a religious
character such as that she was lost  was past forgiveness and dominating and
originating all such thoughts was the belief that she was possessed by satan
or an evil spirit  who was in bodily form within her  this delusion caused
her acute misery  and so absorbed her thoughts that she had ceased to take
any interest in her household affairs  and had even talked of suicide 

her condition on admission and for two years subsequently was that of
recurring states of this acute mental distress  when she would rock to and
fro  moaning and crying out  often with tears over her lost and dreadful
state  and the presence in her inside of satan or the  evil one  whom she
said she felt within her  and who made her  repulsive   this condition was
varied with intervals of usually from one to three days of apparently
complete sanity  when though quiet and somewhat reserved in manner  she was
quite cheerful  when questioned at such times as to her delusion  she would
admit its absurdity  but refer to an uneasy sensation in the region of the
left hypochondrium  which  as she put it  surely meant that there was
something wrong there  she would be occasionally normal in this way for a
week or more  and on more than one occasion was so well as to be allowed out
on parole  but had often to be brought back next day as depressed and
delusive as ever   she was always worse in the mornings  and often improved
as the day went on  she was a stout  pleasant featured and intelligent
woman  somewhat anaemic  and with a slight bluish tinge of lips  though
beyond a lack of tone in sounds  the heart was normal  her anaemic condition
was accounted for by her having suffered from menorrhagia for the greater
part of two years  which only stopped a few months before her admission to
the asylum   it had during its continuance brought on breathlessness on
exertion  and what she called spasms or  grippings at the heart   no doubt
the basis of her uneasy feelings in left hypochondrium  there was a slight
enlargement of the thyroid gland  but no symptoms referable to it   none of
these physical conditions beyond the  grippings at the heart  it maybe 
appeared to have any appreciable influence on her mental condition  which as
has been noted above was normal until a month before her admission  an
interesting feature of the case was the relation between her blood pressure
and her varying mental states  her blood pressure was taken with a riva
rocci sphygmomanometer morning and evening  sometimes oftener  during the
greater part of 1912 13  and it was noted that her depressed or delusional
states were marked by a low pressure  while a high or relatively high
pressure marked her sane and cheerful states  contrary to what is usually
observed in melancholia  though similar to what is seen in agitated
melancholia and mania  4  thus at a pressure of 130  hgs  she was generally
very well  at or about 120  hgs she was often well  at 110  hgs or 100  hgs
she was always ill  when recovering  and few weeks before dismissal there
was a fairly steady pressure of 118  hgs to 120  hgs day after day  it had
been also noted throughout  that during a continuous period of depression 
or of well being  the pressure kept steadily high or low day after day
according to the mental condition  there was obviously then a constant and
close relationship between her blood pressure and her mental states   at
first sight it looked as though those states were directly affected by the
varying pressure as it may have influenced the nutrition and therefore the
functions of the brain  and on physiological grounds it is difficult to
exclude such an influence altogether  even though we come to the conclusion
as we did that the variations followed the emotional conditions  and did not
precede or cause them  the broad general statement has been made that  each
pleasurable emotion raises the general blood pressure and increases the
blood flow through the brain and each painful emotion  brings about the
opposite result   5  it cannot be said  however  that increased blood
pressure will give pleasurable emotion  the splanchnic area can be acted on
so as to raise the blood pressure without influencing the emotions  we know
also that when it is raised in melancholia the increased pressure is
associated with the reverse of pleasurable emotion  still on therapeutical
as well as on other grounds it appeared to us important to determine what 
if any  influence the raising of her blood pressure by drugs or otherwise
would have on her mental state   we did this by baths  by abdominal pressure
by means of a large sand bag laid over the abdomen  and by such drugs as
adrenalin and pituitrin   the results were disappointing so far as therapy
was concerned though of interest otherwise  the pressure was raised by all
these measures without any improvement following such as occurred when it
rose naturally  the rise by abdominal pressure was marked and occurred
quickly  but without any apparent effect on her mental condition  when it
was raised to 140 hgs under the influence of pituitrin there was marked
depression as is shown in the chart for july  1912  pituitrin given in m 
v   hypodermically three times a day  and after some days in larger doses by
the mouth  kept the pressure between 125  hgs and 130  hgs  but with no
corresponding mental improvement  for some days after the pituitrin was
stopped its influence seemed to persist as the pressure kept high while the
mental condition was low   one of her longest spells of continuous mental
depression which lasted for twenty seven days  occurred while her pressure
was high under the influence of adrenalin   digitalis  by the way  had no
influence in any way on either her blood pressure or her mental condition 
the only drug we found of any value was tinctopii in moderate doses three
times a day  but it gradually ceased to do any good

four charts from a very large number are given which illustrate the above
points 

it must be understood that these experiments while accurate so far as they
go  and carefully conducted under my supervision by a competent assistant 
were not made in a well appointed laboratory  but were clinical observations
made in the crowded ward of a hospital for the insane   the central
disturbance here was the result of shock from sudden and excessive fear
acting on a highly sensitive subject as will appear later   it has been
shown by cannon 6  that such major emotions as fear  rage  or pain acting
upon the adrenal glands through the autonomic nervous system are accompanied
by an increased discharge of adrenalin into the blood  and by a passing of
stored glycogen from the liver for circulation through the body as dextrose 
the object of which is the increasing and liberation of muscular energy for
the animal s successful flight or fight  this discharge takes place very
quickly  and we are told that fright exhausts the adrenal glands  a somewhat
puzzling statement at first sight  but borne out by the experience of our
case where a fall of pressure occurred under the paralyzing effect of
extreme fear and distress continued not merely for minutes but for hours at
a time  by and bye as her distress lessened and her expression of it became
more and more automatic  there was a return to the normal adrenal discharge
and consequent normal rise in pressure   it is possible  of course  that
there may be another explanation in the inhibition of metabolism caused by
fear   most of us have experienced the arrest of salivation and digestion
under the influence of fear or rage  this inhibition would affect the
products upon which the adrenal secretion depends  but the more likely cause
is where this fear  in this case really a recurring representation of the
original shock  acts through the autonomic nervous system on the adrenal
glands  the emotional disturbance here then was primarily of central origin 
and was certainly not originated by circulatory or visceral changes which
were secondary to it  and the facts do not support the james  lange theory
of the emotions as it is generally understood  in this connection we may
refer very briefly to the laboratory experiments of sherrington 7  and
bechterew  8  the former by spinal and vagal transection in a dog removed
 completely the sensation of the viscera  of all the skin and muscle behind
the shoulder  the procedure at the same time cuts from connection with the
organs of consciousness the whole of the circulatory apparatus of the body 
yet the dog exhibited rage  fear  disgust  etc   under appropriate stimuli
as a normal dog might do    the conclusion reached after admitting possible
objections to them is that   the vasomotor theory of the production of
emotion becomes  i think untenable  also that visceral presentations are
necessary to emotion   bechterew  discussing this question as to whether the
vascular changes are anterior to the other processes  which determine the
alterations of the neuropsychic tone according to the james  lange theory 
states that the experiments in his laboratory by dr  serenewsky  appear to
lead to an opposite conclusion having shown that under the effects of fear
the alteration of the neuropsychic tone is produced before the appearance of
the cardiovascular phenomena  there are no doubt objections to accepting
laboratory experiments upon inferior animals as conclusive where the psychic
part of the process in question is after all the dominant one  nor must we
forget that biochemical changes may be as important as the integrity of
nerves  we have however referred to these experiments because of their
bearing on the conclusions to be drawn from the above described clinical
facts which so far as the initiation of the emotional process is concerned
confirm them  though we feel that the bodily concomitants of the emotion are
essential to its full development  and that we owe much to james s
presentation of his theory even admitting its  slap dash  9  character to
use his own phrase  it was to be expected that the artificially raised blood
pressure would have had some effect in improving the patient s mental
condition  and in the case of adrenalin  at any rate  some such effect
should have occurred if we are to accept the recently published conclusions
of crilel 10  to the effect that  adrenalin causes increased brain action  
 that brain and adrenalin action go hand in hand  that is  that the adrenal
secretion activates the brain  and that the brain activates the adrenals  
more in harmony with the clinical experiences here is the fact according to
biedl 11   that the adrenalin affects the intracranial and the pulmonary
vessels only slightly if at all   we presume that what is true of adrenalin
in this respect will be true of all drugs which increase blood pressure  and
while the rise of the arterial pressure generally will accelerate the flow
of blood through the brain  yet we know that the cerebral circulation is in
 all physiological conditions  but slightly variable   12  besides  while
that increased flow must necessarily lead to increased cerebral activity 
that activity may be pathological as well as physiological  as in our
patient  who was quite uninfluenced mentally by the rise of blood pressure
which followed the administration of those drugs  the nature and genesis of
the emotional disturbance in this case may be understood from the following

 12  leonard hill  the cerebral circulation 

she had married happily at the age of nineteen years  had a family of eight
children  but had been a widow for about twenty years  her husband died
suddenly abroad  where she had lived with her family for two years after his
death  and acting on the advice of her friends  she came back to this
country bringing all her children with her  this involved her in years of
struggle and anxiety to bring them up creditably  which she managed to do 
during all these years of widowhood and stress she was mentally well  and
latterly she described her life as a happy one surrounded as she was by an
affectionate and well doing family   she had been brought up in a puritan
household  her father and her husband had been deeply and consistently
religious though strict in their belief and observance of the letter  this
upbringing favoured a natural tendency towards religious mysticism which was
also promoted by the creed of the church to which she latterly belonged  and
of which she was a deaconess  in this church the  gift of tongues  and of
 prophesying  was recognized as a part of its heritage  and as she informed
me in one of her normal times  she occasionally spoke or prophesied in the
public assemblies of the congregation   i gathered that her utterances were
generally but a word or two of exhortation or pious aspiration  given
expression to in a moment of exaltation  from her description of her state
at such times  she was carried out of herself  was oblivious for the moment
of the presence and actions of those about her  was in short in a state of
ecstasy when she  prophesied    a natural tendency to self depreciation  and
to ideas of unworthiness asserted themselves outside of those periods of
exaltation  which were generally followed by doubts as to her fitness to
take part in such work  and by the feeling as she expressed it  that she had
presumed as she was unworthy   and that god would be angry with her for her
presumption  throughout her religious life she had been always lacking in
 assurance   latterly this feeling had grown in her and was evidently part
of a deeper feeling of mental depression  as she began to think often  and
with a feeling of dread that she had been surely too happy these later years
which stood in such contrast to the poverty  struggles and disappointments
of the early years of her widowhood  this was her mental condition for some
little time before her attack of acute mental disturbance which began one
night a month before admission to the asylum   she went to bed feeling ill
and shivering as if from a chill   in the middle of the night she woke up in
a fright from a vivid dream the contents of which merged in a strong
sensation as of a hand being pressed on her shoulder  she described the
sensation as being that of a positive feeling of pressure  and with it came
a feeling of dread  and the conviction that it was the hand of satan  so
that she cried out aloud to him to go out of the house  as it was blessed 
referring to the fact  as is the custom in her church that the minister had
blessed the house when she went to live in it   she thought of calling to
her daughter who was asleep near her  but did not  and after a time fell
asleep again being  comforted by the feeling that the lord would take care
of her   next morning the effects of the  chill  had passed off  but there
was left a more or less constant feeling of vague dread and fear of death 
and with this a haunting idea born of this strongly felt hallucination of
external touch that satan was within her  the feelings of dread and fear
grew steadily and became too strong for her faith in the lord taking care of
her  and very quickly her obsession as to possession by satan  became the
definite delusion it was on admission to the asylum   hallucinations of what
might be termed internal touch leading to this idea of possession  are not
unknown in the annals of mysticism of the more morbid types of it  indeed
the more ecstatic the mystic becomes  the more he merges himself in his
feelings and tends to develop hallucinatory sensations  he is possessed  and
desires to be possessed  fortunately for him  by the divine and not the evil
spirit   hallucinations of external touch are as might be expected more
rare  though not uncommon we understand in the more abnormal types  and
occur in people supposed to be normal  havelock ellis tells of a  farmer s
daughter who dreamt that she saw a brother  dead some years  with blood
streaming from his fingers  she awoke in a fright and was comforting herself
with the thought that it was only a dream when she felt a hand grip her
shoulder three times in succession   there was no one in the room  the door
was locked and no explanation seemed possible to her  she was very
frightened  got up at once  dressed  and spent the rest of that night
downstairs working   she was so convinced that a real hand had touched her 
that although it seemed impossible  she asked her brothers if they had not
been playing a trick on her  the nervous shock was considerable  and she was
unable to sleep well for some weeks afterwards    the writer s 13 
explanation is    it is well recognized that involuntary muscular twitches
may occur in the shoulder  especially after it has become subject to
pressure  and that in some cases such contractions may simulate a touch   in
illustration of this he quotes from the psychical society s report on the
 census of hallucination  the case of an overworked  and overworried man
who  a few minutes after leaving a car  had the vivid feeling that someone
had touched him on the shoulder  though on turning round he had found no one
near  he then remembered that on the car he had been leaning on an iron
bolt  and therefore what he had experienced was doubtless a spontaneous
muscular contraction excited by the pressure  touches felt on awakening in
correspondence with a dream are not so very uncommon   we think as to this
likely enough explanation  that whatever the local sensation may have been 
or however slight  as it probably was  it could only give rise to an
hallucination of having been touched by some external personality when it
was absorbed into  and became a part of a considerable emotional disturbance
as in the case of the girl above referred to  and of my patient  in both
cases associated with a frightsome dream  the illness of the latter began
with a dream  and its continuance was in our opinion  largely due to dreams
of a painful character  during the whole period of her residence it was
noted that she dreamt a great deal  and that they were terrifying or
alarming dreams  and that her bad days were generally preceded by a bad
dream  notes of her dreams were regularly made  at one time for ten
consecutive nights  and only three of them were so far as she remembered
free from dreams   all of her dreams she described as  awful   many of them
were of being mixed up with objectionable people who behaved roughly and
used profane language  but  and of this she was very certain  who never
talked or acted obscenely  she frequently dreamt of being on high
precipitous places from which she was either falling  or could not get away
from  she described one vivid dream during which she suffered great misery 
and awoke from in great distress   she dreamt that she was listening to a
preacher with open bible in his hand  that he spoke about peter whom he was
accusing of disobedience  a number of people were present but she saw
particularly only one man who looked very happy  the sermon ended  and she
awoke in  agony   this feeling being due  she said  to the conviction
present with her  that the sermon  and the man s happiness were intended to
show her how much she had lost since she was cut off from  grace  by satan
dwelling in her body  again she dreamt of a near relative whom she heard
singing   and they all speak in tongues to magnify the lord    this brought
sorrow to her of which she was conscious during the dream and after she
awoke as she thought satan was putting this before her to show her what she
had lost   in another dream she saw three unpleasant looking men talking
together   the worst looking of them of jewish appearance  came close to her
face  and argued with her about the evil spirit  she said  he was in her
body   and he answered  away with him   she fell asleep and dreamt the same
dream again   these dreams were obviously governed by her dread and fear as
to her religious position  the following one is somewhat different    a big
brown beast came up to her and pressed against her face  she slept again and
dreamt she was in a big ship sailing in black and dirty water  that she
tried hard to get out of the ship  but could not  and awoke in great
distress   we presume freudians would find in the latent content of all
these dreams  particularly in this last one  evidence in favour of their
positions  though to us they reveal only  in the blurred and broken way
dreams do  the prevailing trend of thoughts governed by morbid religious
fears and garbed in the phraseology and symbolism of a judaic faith  the
sameness of their ending and meaning to her being obviously due to their
relation to the dream which ushered in her illness to which indeed most of
them were closely related in geneses and content  no doubt freudian
psychoanalysis would be able to carry her memory back into the region of
long forgotten infantile or early sex memories where  as in every normal
human being they lie  the shadowy outlines of instinctive feelings whose
roots are in a far away  phylogenetic past  having apart from suggestion no
role as factors in the production of morbid fears or fancies  the
fantastical and too often repulsive dream interpretations of this school
forcibly remind us of the words of lord bacon   with regard to the
interpretation of natural dreams it is a thing that has been laboriously
handled by many writers  but it is full of follies   all kinds of trivial
incidents of childhood and early youth are stored up by all of us  and are
recalled in sudden and unexpected ways  but not because of any relaxation of
a supposed  censor   nor necessarily because of any content of a sex nature 
but because they are more often than not associated with fear  chief of the
coarser emotions  and a more primitive and more enduring emotion than any of
those connected with reproduction  and more alien to the organism than sex
memories even of a perverse order  their resurrection being due to some
subtle association between the present and the past  generally a sensory
one  visual or auditory most frequently  in our own case the earliest
recollections of childhood are so associated and recollected   sunshine
amongst trees  and birds singing bring back to us at very long intervals a
country scene where as a child we were frightened by threats of a  bogie
man   the only childish incidents which unexpectedly recur with us were
associated with childish fears and disappointments of a usual and ordinary
character never with morbid elements or emotional complexes which were
repressed or censored in the freudian sense  and in this we are not
singular

again and again  association tests  as prescribed by jung  and repeated
examinations of a psychological character were made without our being able
to obtain the slightest indication of their being erotic or similar
influences of the slightest value as factors in the causation of her mental
disturbance   the chief value of jung s tests we have found to be the
suggestion of lines of inquiry or the confirmation of evidence obtained in
other ways  the results here were negative and in that confirmed what we
knew from the history and character of our patient as a pure minded woman of
blameless life   she was constitutionally timid  and all her life liable to
doubts and fears of a morbid type  as an instance of this she told us that
when twelve years of age while influenced by the death of her step mother 
which had just taken place  one morning early her father went out to his
work leaving her in bed  and alone in the house  immediately after he left
she heard or more likely thought she heard  someone lift the latch of the
door  as if to come in  but though no one came in she was left in a state of
great fear  so marked that for long afterwards she dreaded being left alone 
and still remembers vividly her feelings during that experience  this
temperament she carried into her religious life which as we have seen was
marked by fears and doubts   no one will deny that fear is the type of
asthenic manifestations  yet is it not the mother of phantoms of numberless
superstitions  of altogether irrational and chimerical religious
practices   14  the strength and character of her beliefs as well as the
religious teachings and influences to which she had been subjected from her
earliest years  all tended to develop the mystical in a temperament ready
for the dissociation necessary to enable the mystic to attain to that
ecstasy or absorption in something outside and beyond the self which is the
essence of that state  why the ecstasy which she knew and desired should
pass into its opposite is not difficult to understand when the above history
is considered 

 14  ribot  the creative imagination    p  34 

the shock which originated the attack gave form and reality to fears and
doubts which had been assailing her for some time  and to the influence of
which she was specially liable at this time by the lowered physiological
tension  the result of her previous menorrhagia  and by the fact that the
comparative ease and comfort of her later life had given her opportunities
for introspection absent during her previous life of struggle for and
interest in others  she was then scrupulous  timid and superstitious  a
mystical  a psychopathic temperament  taking her place all the same with
john bunyan and other chief of sinners whose self depreciation and
absorption in the struggle for salvation from sin and the power of the
devil  though morbid in character was not pathological  but when satan
became not merely a spirit influencing her  but had entered bodily into her 
the border was crossed  and she was to herself literally possessed  and
became filled with fear  a fear pathological in action  dominating her
mentally and physically during her dissociated states  once initiated it is
not difficult to see how these dissociated states which recurred so
regularly and persisted so long were kept up by her temperament  and her
constantly recurring dreams of a terrifying or depressing character  which
were  as we have already indicated  but representations of the original
shock  the following quotation applies closely to her case   on this view an
intense  sudden painful experience  especially if the significance of it can
be dimly felt  but not understood  may persist long and latently
unassimilated by the central consciousness and without fusion with it 
almost as if it were a foreign body in the psychic system   15  professor
james has termed the pathological emotion an objectless emotion  but as
professor dewey puts it  from its own standpoint it is not objectless  it
goes on at once to supply itself with an object  with a rational excuse for
being   16  here the sensations in the left hypochondrium which she had
described as  grippings at the heart   became the object which  under the
influence of the initial shock with its unusual and alarming sensations and
feelings  she interpreted as she did

her recovery was very gradual and marked by many relapses  in her treatment
as in our ideas as to the causation of the disorder  we put the accent on
the psychic rather than on the physical factors  we did not however
underrate the latter but constantly sought to improve her bodily health and
condition   when at her worst in 1911 her weight  taken monthly  was round
about one hundred and sixty pounds  in 1912 it went up from one hundred and
sixty six to one hundred and eighty eight pounds and averaged one hundred
and seventy six pounds  but as in the case of her blood pressure  the rise
was due largely to her mental improvement   it may be of interest to note
here that during and after a somewhat severe attack of diarrhoea with
hemorrhage from the bowels  her mental condition was better than usual  as
might even have been expected considering the mental distraction the attack
involved 

we were satisfied that we could have shortened materially the duration of
her illness  two years   by hypnotic suggestion  but unfortunately her
friends objected to this mode of treatment  suggestion in the waking state
had been abundantly used  but with little apparent effect of an immediate
kind

plant and flower symbolism

a number of plant and flower symbols have a different significance from that
which is generally given to them   we are all quite familiar with the grape
vine of bacchus and the association of that deity with grapes  according to
r  p  knight  this too  symbolizes a sexual attribute  speaking of bacchus 
he writes   the vine was a favorite symbol of the deity  which seems to have
been generally employed to signify the generative or preserving attribute 
intoxicating liquors were stimulative  and therefore held to be aphrodisiac 
the vase is often employed in its stead to express the same idea and is
often accompanied by the same accessory symbol  

we have often seen in sculptures and paintings  heads of barley associated
with the god of the harvest   this symbol would appear to be self
explanatory  yet we are told by more than one writer that it contains
another symbolic meaning as well  h  m  westropp  speaking of this says 
 the kites or female organ  as the symbol of the passive or productive power
of nature  generally occurs on ancient roman monuments as the concha
veneris  a fig  barley corn  and the letter delta    we are told that the
grain of barley  because of its form  was a symbol of the vulva 

a great many other female symbols might be mentioned  the pomegranate is
constantly seen in the hands of proserpine   the fig cone is carried by the
assyrian baal  and the fig in numerous processions has a similar
significance  when we add to these the various forms of tree worship
described above  we see to what an extent the products of nature were used
as symbols in the worship of sex 

among flower symbols there is one which recurs constantly throughout the art
and mythology of india  egypt  china  and many other eastern countries  this
is the lotus  of which the easter lily is the modern representative  the
lotus appears in a number of forms in the records of antiquity  we have
symbolic pictures of the lion carrying the lotus in its mouth  doubtless a
male and female symbol   the deities of india are depicted standing on the
lotus  or are spoken of as being  born of the lotus     the chinese   1 
says the author of rites and ceremonies   worship a goddess whom they call
puzza  and of whom their priests give the following account   they say that
 three nymphs came down from heaven to wash themselves in the river  but
scarce had they gotten in the water before the herb lotus appeared on one of
their garments  with its coral fruit upon it   they were surprised to think
whence it could proceed  and the nymph upon whose garment it was could not
resist the temptation of indulging herself in tasting it  but by thus eating
some of it she became pregnant  and was delivered of a boy  whom she brought
up  and then returned to heaven  he afterwards became a great man  a
conqueror and legislator  and the nymph was afterwards worshipped under the
name of puzza     puzza corresponds to the indian buddha

in egyptian architecture the lotus is a fundamental form  and indeed it is
said to he the main motive of the architecture of that civilization  the
capitals of the column are modelled after one form or other of this plant 
that of the doric column is the seed vessel pressed flat  earlier capitals
are simple copies of the bell or seed vessel  the columns consisted of
stalks of the plant grouped together  in other cases the leaves are used as
ornaments   these orders were copied by the greeks  and subsequently by
western countries 

we may ask ourselves  what is the meaning of this mystic lotus which was
held in sufficient veneration to be incorporated in all the temples of
religion  as well as in myths of the deity  this  too  refers to the
deification of sex   o brien  in the  round towers of ireland  states   the
lotus was the most sacred plant of the ancients  and typified the two
principles of the earth fecundation   the germ standing for the lingam  the
filaments and petals for the yoni  

r  p  knight states   we find it  the lotus  employed in every part of the
northern hemisphere where symbolical worship does or ever did prevail  the
sacred images of the tarters  japanese or indians  are all placed upon it
and it is still sacred in tibet and china   the upper part of the base of
the lingam also consists of the flower of it blended with the most
distinctive characteristics of the female sex  in which that of the male is
placed  in order to complete this mystic symbol of the ancient religion of
the brahmans  who  in their sacred writings  speak of brahma sitting upon
his lotus throne  

alexander wilder  2  states that the term  nymphe  and its derivations was
used to designate young women  brides  the marriage chamber  the lotus
flower  oracular temples and the labiae minores of the human female 

 2  the symbolical language of ancient art and mythology 

the lotus then  which is found throughout antiquity  in art as well as in
religion  was a sexual symbol  representing to the ancients the combination
of male and female sexual organs  it is another expression of the sex
worship of that period 

our present conventional symbols of art are very easily traced to ancient
symbols of religion   we may expect these to be phallic in their meaning  to
just the extent that phallicism was fundamental in the religions where these
symbols originated  from the designs of some of the ornamental friezes of
nineveh  we find these principles illustrated   on those bas reliefs is
found the earliest form of art  really the dawn of art upon early
civilization   here is the beginning of certain designs which were destined
to be carried to the later civilizations of greece  rome and probably of
egypt   these friezes show the pine cone alternating with a modified form of
the lotus  the significance of which symbols we have explained  there are
also shown animal representations before the sacred tree or grove  a phallic
symbol   from these forms and others were designed a number of conventional
symbols which were used throughout a much later civilization   see  nineveh
and its remains    a  layard  



animal symbolism

one sees in the religions of antiquity  especially those of india  assyria 
greece and egypt  a great number of sacred animal representations   the bull
was sacred to osiris in egypt  and one special animal was attended with all
the pomp of a god  at one time in assyria the god was always associated with
a sacred animal  often the goat  which was supposed to possess the qualities
for which the god was worshipped   out of this developed the ideal animal
creations  of which the animal body and the human head and the winged bulls
of nineveh are examples  the mystic centaurs and satyrs originated from this
source  at a later time the whole was humanized  merely the horns  ears or
hoofs remaining as relics of the animal form 

we learn that in these religions the animal was not merely worshipped as
such   it was a certain quality which was deified  the assyrian goat
attendant upon the deity  was in some bas reliefs  not only represented in
priapic attitudes  but a female sexual symbol was so placed as to signify
sexual union  we shall show later that certain male and female symbolic
animals were so placed on coins as to symbolically indicate sexual union 

an animal symbol which has probably been of universal use is that of the
snake or serpent   serpent worship has been described in almost every
country of which we have records or legends  in egypt  we find the serpent
on the headdress of many of the gods   in africa the snake is still sacred
with many tribes  the worship of the hooded snake was probably carried from
india to egypt   the dragon on the flag and porcelain of china is also a
serpent symbol   in central america were found enormous stone serpents
carved in various forms  in scandinavia divine honors were paid to serpents 
and the druids of britain carried on a similar worship 

serpent worship has been shown by many writers to be a form of sex worship 
it is often phallic  and we are told by hargrave jennings that the serpent
possibly was added to the male and female symbols to represent desire  thus 
the hindu women carried the lingam in procession between two serpents  and
in the sacred procession of bacchus the greeks carried in a sacred casket
the phallus  the egg  and a serpent 

the greeks also had a composite or ideal figure   rays were added to the
head of a serpent thereby bringing it into relation with the sun god apollo 
or the crest or comb of a cock was added with similar meaning 

many reasons have been offered to explain why the serpent has been used to
represent the male generative attribute  some have called attention to its
tenacity of life  others have spoken of its supposed mystic power of
regeneration by casting its skin  again  it seems probable that the form is
of symbolic significance  however this may be  we find that this universal
serpent worship of primitive man was a form of phallicism so prevalent in
former times 

many other animals may be mentioned   the sacred bull  so frequently met
with in egypt  assyria and greece  was a form under which bacchus was
worshipped  r  p  knight speaks as follows   the mystic bacchus  or
generative power was represented under this form  not only upon coins but
upon the temples of the greeks  sometimes simply as a bull  at other times
as a human face  and at others entirely human except the horns and ears  

we would probably be in error to interpret all these animal symbols as
exclusively phallic although many were definitely so  thus  while hermes was
a priapic deity  he was also a deity of the fields and the harvests  so the
bull may have been chosen for its strength as well as its sexual attributes 

there are many animals which were symbolic of the female generative power 
the cow is frequently so employed  the hindus have the image of a cow in
nearly every temple  the deity corresponding to the grecian venus   in the
temple of philae in egypt  isis is represented with the horns and ears of a
cow joined to a beautiful woman   the cow is still sacred in many parts of
africa   the fish symbol was a very frequent representative of woman  the
goddess of the phoenicians being represented by the head and body of a woman
terminating below in a fish  the head of proserpine is frequently surrounded
by dolphins  indeed  the female principle is regularly shown by some
representative of water  fire and water respectively being regarded as male
and female principles 

male and female attributes are often combined on coins for purposes of
sexual symbolism   r  p  knight explains these symbols as follows   it
appears therefore that the asterisk  bull  or minotaur  in the centre of a
square or labyrinth equally mean the same as the indian lingam   that is the
male personification of the productive attribute placed in the female  or
heat acting upon humidity   sometimes the bull is placed between two
dolphins  and sometimes upon a dolphin or another fish  and in other
instances the goat or the ram occupy the same situation  which are all
different modes of expressing different modifications of the same meaning in
symbolical or mystical writings  the female personifications frequently
occupy the same place  in which case the male personification is always upon
the reverse of the coin  of which numerous instances occur in those of
syracuse  naples  tarentum  and other cities    by the asterisk above
mentioned the writer refers to a circle surrounded by rays  a sun symbol of
male significance  the square or labyrinth is the lozenge shaped symbol or
yoni of india 

the above interpretations throw much light on the obscurity of the animal
worship of antiquity   this explains the partly humanized types  and the
final appearance of a human deity with only animal horns remaining  as
representing the form under which the deity was once worshipped  the satyrs 
centaurs  and other animal forms are all part of these same representations
and are similarly explained 

our main object in giving the above account of these various symbols has
been to illustrate the wide prevalence of sex worship among primitive races 
another end as well has been served  our study gives us a certain insight
into the type of mind which evolves symbolism  and so a few remarks on the
use of symbolism as here illustrated are not inappropriate 

we feel that while this symbolism may indicate a high degree of mechanical
skill in execution  it does not follow that it expresses either deep or
complicated intellectual processes  in fact  we are inclined to regard such
symbolism as the indication of a comparatively simple intellect   it appears
obscure and involved to us  because we do not understand the symbols  from
those which we do understand  the meaning is graphically but simply
expressed 

on coins  bas reliefs and monuments  we find the majority of these simple
emblems   if the desire is to express the union of male and female
principles  a male symbolic animal is simply placed upon the corresponding
female symbol   thus  a goat or bull may be placed upon the back of a
dolphin or other fish  this is a graphic presentation but certainly one of a
most simple nature   sometimes the male symbol is on one side of the coin
and then the female is always on the reverse  unions are made which do not
occur in nature  and the representation is not a subtle one 

in india  if there was a desire to express a number of attributes of the
deity  another head or face is added or additional arms are added to hold up
additional symbols  in greece  when the desire was to express the androgyne
qualities of the deity  a beard was added to the female face  or one half of
the statuette represented the male form  the other the female  such
representations do not indicate great ingenuity  however skillfully they may
be executed 



sun worship and sun myths

as is generally known  traces of sun worship are found in almost every
country of which we have a record   in egypt ra was the supreme sun god
where there was very elaborate worship conducted in his honor  in greece
apollo was attended with similar festivities  in the norse mythology  many
of the myths deal with the worship of the sun in one form or another   in
england  stonehenge and the entire system of the druids had to do with solar
worship  in central america and peru  temples to the sun were of amazing
splendor  furnished as they were with wonderful displays of gold and silver 
the north american indians have many legends relating to sun worship and
sacrifices to the sun  and china and japan give numerous instances of the
same religion   sun worship is so readily shown to be fundamental with
primitive races that we will not discuss it in detail at this time  but
rather will give the conclusions of certain writers who have explained its
meaning 

at the present day  the sun is regularly regarded as a male being  the earth
a female   we speak of mother earth  etc   in former times  the ancients
depicted the maternal characteristics of the earth in a much more material
way   likewise the sun was a male deity  being often the war god  vigorous
and all powerful   we readily see to what an extent the male sun god was
portrayed in mythology as a human being  in many myths  the god dies during
the winter  reappears in the spring  is lamented in the fall  etc   all in
keeping with the changes in the activity of the sun during the different
seasons 

the moon was associated with the female deity of the ancients  isis is
accompanied by the moon on most coins and emblems  venus has the same
symbols   indeed  the star and crescent of our modern times  of the turkish
flag and elsewhere  are in reality the sun and crescent of antiquity  male
and female symbols in conjunction   lunar ornaments of pre historic times
have been found throughout england and ireland  and doubtless explain the
superstitions about the moon in those countries  the same prehistoric
ornaments are found in italy   in the legends of the north american indians 
moon is sun s wife 

the full extent of these beliefs is pointed out by mr  john newton in
 assyrian grove worship    here we see that the ancient hindus gave a much
more literary relationship between the sun and earth than we are accustomed
to express in modern times  he states   this representative of the union of
the sexes typifies the divine sakti  or productive energy  in union with the
pro creative or generative power as seen throughout nature  the earth was
the primitive pudendum or yoni which is fecundated by the solar heat  the
sun  the primitive linga  to whose vivifying rays man and animals  plants
and the fruits of the earth  owe their being and continued existence  

it is not possible to discuss sun worship at any length without at the same
time discussing phallicism and serpent worship  hargrave jennings  who has
made careful study of these worships  points out their general identity in
the following paragraph  he states    the three most celebrated emblems
carried in the greek mysteries were the phallus  the egg  and the serpent 
or otherwise the phallus  the yoni or umbilicus  and the serpent  the first
in each case is the emblem of the sun or of fire  as the male or active
generative power   the second denotes the passive nature or female principle
or the emblem of water  the third symbol indicates the destroyer  the
reformer or the renewer   the uniter of the two  and thus the preserver or
perpetuater eternally renewing itself   the universality of serpentine
worship  or phallic adoration  is attested by emblematic sculptures or
architecture all the world over  

the author of the  round towers of ireland  in discussing the symbols of sun
worship  serpent worship and phallicism  found on the same tablet 
practically reiterates these statements  he says    i have before me the
sameness of design which belonged indifferently to solar worship and to
phallic   i shall  ere long  prove that the same characteristic extends
equally to ophiolatreia  and if they all three be identical  as it thus
necessarily follows  where is the occasion for surprise at our meeting the
sun  phallus and serpent  the constitutent symbols of each  embossed upon
the same table and grouped under the same architrave  

by a number of references  we could readily show the identity of all these
worships   the preceding paragraphs give  in summary form  the conclusions
of those writers who have made such religions their special study   we shall
not exemplify this further  but will now point out the general relationship
of sun worship to the religious festivals and mythology of the ancients 
this relationship becomes important when it is appreciated that the sun
worship expressed in the mysteries is also a part of phallicism  on some of
these festive occasions the phallus was carried in the front of the
procession and at other times the egg  the phallus and the serpent were
carried in the secret casket 



ancient festivals and mysteries

the ancients expressed their religious beliefs in a dramatic way on a number
of occasions throughout the year   the festivities were held in the spring 
autumn  or winter   these were to commemorate the activities of the sun  his
renewed activity in the spring calling forth rejoicing and his decline in
the fall being the cause of sorrow and lamentation  as well as the
festivities  there were the various mysteries  such as the eleusinia  the
dionysia and the bacchanalia   these were conducted by the priests who
moulded religious beliefs and guarded their secrets  the mysteries were of
the utmost importance and the most sacred of religious conceptions were here
dramatized 

mythology also gave expression to the religious ideas of the time and we
find that the most important myths  dramatically produced at the religious
festivals  were sun myths 

the annual festivities and mysteries will be discussed together because both
were intended to dramatize the same beliefs  both were under priestly
control and so were national institutions  the festivals were for the common
people but the mysteries were fully understood only to the initiated 

while no very clear account of the mysteries has been given  a certain theme
seems to run through them all  and this is found in the myths as well   a
drama is enacted  in which the god is lost  is lamented  and is found or
returns amid great rejoicing  3  this was enacted in egypt where the
mourning was for osiris  and in greece for adonis  and later for bacchus 
all these are  of course  sun gods  and the whole dramatization or myth is
in keeping with the activities of the sun 

 3  the enactment and rebirth 

on these occasions  the main object seems to have been to restore the lost
god  or to insure his reappearance   the women took the leading part and
mourned for osiris  adonis or bacchus   they wandered about the country at
night in the most frenzied fashion  avoided all men and sought the god  at
times  during the winter festival  the quest would be fruitless  in the
spring  when they indulged themselves in all sorts of orgies and
extravagances  adonis was found 

the underlying motive appears to have been to enact a drama in which the
deity was supposed to exercise his procreative function by sexual union with
the women   this was an ideal which they wished to express dramatically  in
order to realize this ideal obstacles were introduced that they might be
overcome  in the old myth  adonis was emasculated under a pine tree  and in
egypt osiris was similarly mutilated  his sex organs being lost  but at the
festivals it was portrayed that adonis was found  and in the myth  osiris
was restored to isis in the form of horus  the morning sun   in a number of
myths  the god is said to have visited the earth to cohabitate with the
women  an occurrence which was doubtless desired  in order that the deistic
attributes might be continued in the race  thus  judging from what we have
been able to learn of this subject  the worship expressed in the mysteries
revolved about sexual union  the desire being to dramatize the continued
activity of deistic qualities 

this character of many of the festivals and mysteries is very evident  in
the eleusinian mysteries the rape of persephone by pluto  the winter god  is
portrayed   the mother  demeter  mourns for her daughter  her mourning is
dramatically carried out by a large procession  and this enactment requires
several days   finally persephone is restored  the earlier part of the
festival was for dramatic interest  and the real object was the union of
persephone with bacchus    the union of persephone with bacchus  i e   with
the sun god  whose work is to promote fruitfulness  is an idea special to
the mysteries and means the union of humanity with the godhead  the
consummation aimed at in the mystic rites   hence  in all probability the
central teaching of the mysteries was personal immortality  analogue of the
return of the bloom to plants in spring   4 

 4  dr  otto rhyn  mysteria 

the mysteries of samothrace were probably simpler  here the phallus was
carried in procession as the emblem of hermes   in the dionysian mysteries
which were held in mid winter  the quest of the women was unsuccessful and
the festival was repeated in the spring   the roman mysteries of bacchus
were of much later development  and consequently became very debased  men as
well as women eventually came to take part in the ceremony  and the whole
affair degenerated into the grossest of sexual excesses and perversions 

we have stated what appears to us to have been the underlying motives of the
religious festivals and mysteries  namely  the enactment of a drama in which
the reproductive qualities of the deity were portrayed  the phallus was
carried in procession for this purpose and the women dramatized the motive
as searching for the god  our account can be regarded as little more than an
outline  but it is sufficient for our present purposes   it indicates that
the mysteries give an expression of phallic worship  just as do the various
monuments of art and religion to which we have referred   it may also be
said that this same worship is represented in what may be termed early
literature  for much of the early mythology deals with the same subject  the
study of origins in mythology  however  cannot be dealt with adequately in
our present communication 



conclusion

we have now traced the worship of sex  as recorded by the monuments of
antiquity  through its various phases   in its simplest form  the generative
organs are worshipped without disguise  the sexual act also forms a part of
religious ceremonies   later  a rude symbolism develops  as the race becomes
more advanced  this becomes more elaborate  until finally a considerable
degree of ingenuity and skill are evidenced  the worship of sex is not only
expressed in religious usages  but comes to dominate early art as well  it
is also expressed in mythology  and so we find the same symbolical and
allegorical expressions in early literature  in fact  the deepest thoughts
of primitive races  as expressed in their religion  eventually dominate most
of the customs and usages of every day life 

we may appropriately ask  why did primitive people deify the sexual organs 
this question may be answered when we understand the religious ceremonies of
primitive tribes  the earliest objects worshipped were those which were of
known benefit to man   the aborigines of australia have very elaborate
ceremonies which superficially seem meaningless but when understood have a
very definite meaning   this aim is to ensure some certain product of the
earth   if it is a yam 5  ceremony  an elaborate procedure is carried out
which is supposed to make yams grow  there is a secret ceremonial object
which is a symbol of the yam and which bears to it more or less resemblance 
other ceremonies are carried out for similar purposes  the meaning of all
these semi religious performances  as clearly shown by spencer baldwin  is
to ensure the benfits which nature gives   this  in brief  explains nature
worship  and were it our object at present  it would be most interesting to
show the peculiar resemblance of these ceremonies to those carried on in sex
worship 

 5  a kind of sweet potato 

as the early races advanced in knowledge  they came to know that the
perpetuation of the race depended upon generative attributes  for this
reason human generative attributes were deified and appropriate ceremonies
were held  just as in the case of nature worship  these are not  lewd
practices   as they are not infrequently called  it is indeed regrettable
that the subject of sex worship has been disregarded by many historians  as
thereby erroneous impressions are given  the facts of nature worship have
always been much better understood and its importance has been realized 
those of sex worship have been less carefully recorded 

the literature and philosophy which we are accustomed to associate with
greek thought are of a later date  once such abstract reasoning is possible 
sex worship is no longer seriously entertained   the symbolism remains  but
is  associated now  not so much with religion as with art  likewise in
india  the early buddhism  which was sex worship  has changed to the present
day buddhistic philosophy  the symbols alone remaining 

from all this we are inclined to believe that in sex worship we are dealing
with important motives in the development of the race  we make no presence
of having exhausted the subject in this communication  the decadence of this
religion  as observed in the early christian period  and in fact well
through the middle ages  forms a very interesting history  it is not our
purpose  however  to deal with it at present  likewise  it should be
understood that the motives which we have been discussing are not
necessarily the earliest manifested in racial development  we have a record
of a time in the history of man when the worship of sex had not yet made its
appearance but this period also is not a part of our present topic 

the influence of early racial motives upon present day civilization is a
topic of great interest   its importance is  in fact  the main object of
studies of this kind   however  we wish our account to be mainly an
historical one  and so will not at present make reference to a number of
applications which arise  we have also refrained from making use of the
modern writings on matters of sex  as we thereby avoid criticism to the
effect that our findings have been drawn from biased sources  we feel that
while the reader may disagree in certain details as here set forth  the
universal appearance of sex worship at a certain stage of racial development
is scarcely to be denied  the writers whom we have cited are all of a former
generation  and they were searching for origins in religion  not in sexual
life  inadvertently they found the latter  in fact could not avoid it  and
so their conclusions are all the more valuable to us

reviews

the meaning of dreams   by isador h  coriat   little  brown and company 
boston  1915  pages xiv plus 194 

this concise and well written little book hardly needs reviewing for the
readers of the journal of abnormal psychology as all who have followed dr 
coriat s writings for the last few years will know at once the nature of the
book and what it contains  his purpose is evidently to give a simple clear
statement of the position of the freudian school and he accomplishes this
with more than ordinary success   he is lavish in his praises of freud and
seemingly accepts unquestionably the whole mass of freudian doctrines   one
searches in vain for the least question or the slightest suggestion that
some of the freudian concepts might possibly be wrong   everywhere the words
of freud and the beliefs of the author are given as absolute  eternal and
unquestionable   he incorporates some of the recent additions to the
freudian teachings  such as brill s treatment of the  artificial dream   but
concerning the fundamentals he leaves the original doctrines without
noticeable modification  in discussing the mechanisms of dreams he adds a
fifth to the original four  calling his addition  reinforcement  
reinforcement is the mechanism by which  the prominent or primary wish of
the dream is reinforced  expressed anew for the purpose of emphasis by means
of a second dream following the first  really a dream within a dream   with
this exception he leaves the original freudian teachings intact and
unchanged   he says that a dream is the fulfilment of a wish and no
modifications of the statement follow that could possibly make one think he
meant anything else  his definite position is stated as follows    the term
 wish  in psycho analysis is very comprehensive and connotes in a broad
sense all our desires  ambitions or strivings    he illustrates his points
by numerous dreams which he has himself analyzed  he will probably meet some
objection from those who are not ardent freudians concerning some of these
dreams as the interpretation is not always  perfectly clear  as he says it
is to him  some may say that at least a dozen other interpretations might
just as well and just as logically have been given  but this is the
objection that is raised concerning all freudian literature  the best
characterization of the book is to say that it is typically freudian 

 as a side issue  it is interesting to notice how many of the dreams given
relate to the european war   some one has said that america shows her
concern over the war by the way americans dream  

there are two characteristics of the book which are worthy of special
mention and for which dr  coriat needs special praise  one of these is that
it is so simply written that the general public can read it and understand
it   no other freudian publication which the reviewer has seen can boast of
the same simplicity  the other point is that absolutely everything
concerning sex which could possibly be objectionable has been ruled out 
there is not a word or a sentence in the book that a precise maiden lady
need hesitate to read to her sunday school class or at a pink tea   in doing
this dr  coriat has indeed achieved the impossible as all will readily
agree  this book is probably too elementary for the majority of the readers
of the journal of abnormal psychology but it is destined to fill a place
which no previous freudian publication could ever fill  it is a book for the
general public and the beginner in psychology and for this purpose it is
truly a little gem  raymond bellamy   emory and henry college 



the psychoneuroses and their treatment by psychotherapy  by professor j 
dejerine and dr  e  gauckler   authorized translation by smith ely jelliffe

this book is another instance of the lack of a common nomenclature in
psychopathology   psychological mechanisms are penetratingly discussed  and
important syntheses are made regarding categories which many american
psychopathologists name differently not to speak of the nomenclature of the
repressionist of vienna   it seems to the reviewer indeed  that what the
authors call neurasthenia is merely a somewhat complex elaboration of the
psychosis by induction to which babinski has restricted the name hysteria 
it is true that certain manifestations of this  especially a false
gastropathy  may lead to an increased fatigue  and to this the name
neurasthenic might appropriately be given  but still more often one sees the
appearance of increased fatigue on account of the patient s faulty notion 
and to this the name neurasthenic should certainly not be given 

to place in the same rubric a simple somatic hysteria like a paralysis and
the complications of what are comprised in psychological neurasthenia as so
lucidly described in this book  seems at first sight irrational  but so at
first appeared the placing together of clinical pictures as unlike as
cervical struma  phthisis pulmonalis and ossious caries under the rubric of
tuberculosis  and in a nearer field the synthesis of catatonia  hebephrenia
and cementing paranoia into the rubric of dementia precox   so  recognizing
the accuracy of the beautiful analysis of professor dejerine of what he
calls neurasthenia  we venture to assimilate it with the equally true
analysis which babinski has made of the immediate mechanism of what he
wishes to call pithiatism  it is the condition which we personally term
hysteria  and the mechanism of which we have more especially studied in the
traumatic neuroses and the occupational dyskinesias and some other disorders
incident to the exercise of trade or profession   indeed  the authors
say    one can see that the helmet headache  the pain in the nape of the
neck  and the pain in the spine are frequent among cultivated people and
educated neurasthenics  but much rarer among the others  and he explains
this by saying that these disturbances  are due to the diffusion of the
attention towards obsessions or preoccupations   and he gives as an example
the reply of a patient  i think of my illness or such vicissitude by which
it was brought about   indeed  in one place  professor dejerine goes so far
as to permit himself to say that the hypochondriac preoccupation itself
constitutes originally a purely intellectual conception  a propos of which 
but secondarily to it the patient really may work up an emotion  but which
is really not of emotional origin  a position first taken and long insisted
upon by the reviewer 

what is this when traced to its source but the mechanism of suggestion  the
portion of the book describing the functional manifestations of the
digestive system is charged with most illuminating instances of
associational mechanism typifying the induction of morbid reactions by
suggestion  no one perusing them can fail to perceive that the psychological
process at work does not differ in principle from that found in the somatic
hysterias  from which therefore their separation seems unjustifiable  and at
the hands of so eminent an author is likely to maintain rather than diminish
present psychological misunderstanding 

the dissimilarity of terms and resemblances of ideas has another
illustration in the reference to energy and the will  here it is clearly
pointed out that the apparent aboulia of the  neurasthenic  is not a lack 
but an unfruitful directing of the will while the viennese school imply the
same idea in their doctrine of sublimation 

the authors believe that neurasthenia differs from the psychasthenia of
janet in that the latter is constitutional  and that the obsessions are
secondary  when analysed profoundly  to some pain bearing contingency which
by the mechanism of association has pervaded the mind and which henceforth
distorts it with subsequent realities  and yet when dejerine lays stress
upon the fact that badly organized moral hygiene conduces to the emotional
preoccupations which lead to obsessions and which he regards as the
essential characteristics of the neurasthenic constitution  he leaves no
apparent distinction from the psychasthenia of janet 

 the fundamental distinction of neurasthenia is causation by emotion   but
the authors have not extricated this factor from the role played by
induction either of idea or its secondary emotion  in such a fundamental
matter as anaesthesia for instance  they say   in our opinion there exist
three classes of hysterical anesthesia  in the first series of facts one may
place the cases due to simulation  in the second group of cases we shall
range the patients in whom the disturbances of sensibility are directly due
to suggestion  finally there remains a third class of patients in whom the
disturbances of sensibility seem to us to be residual emotional phenomena  

 emotion is able to suppress sensibility entirely by producing absolute
side tracking  and that under such circumstances it was really a question of
total anesthesia and not purely psychoanesthesia  when the state has passed
and the emotional cause has disappeared the sensibility may return  but
anesthesia which is preserved may also persist  either by auto suggestion or
as in the case of the individual who remarks that he felt none of the
various injuries which he has experienced  or it is a question of simple
residual phenomenon independent of all suggestion   and yet  further on  the
authors say that the phenomena of auto suggestion cannot be separated from
the emotion  all this lacks clarity  and except in the instances of failure
of perception or of auto suggestion  the mechanism is not intelligibly set
forth 

the authors  however  although under the deplorable classification of
neurasthenia or hysteria  depart from the usual therapeutic methods and seek
the cause of the patient s disease outside of the objective symptoms and
declare that the  element of diagnosis lies chiefly in the origin of the
symptoms  

they make much of the assertion that dr  weir mitchell s method of treatment
is based practically upon isolation  rest in bed  over feeding  douches 
massage and electricity  in fact on purely physical measures and professor
dejerine adds   i was not long in discovering that unless the patient s
state of mind improved  the therapeutic results were far from satisfactory  
and he gives examples 

but in spite of the objections to the nosology and psychopathological theory
of the authors  there remains nothing but the highest praise for the
presentation of the clinical facts and of the sound advice regarding the
therapy of various functional manifestations  and concerning the role of the
physician in the prophylaxis of the psychogenic neuroses  it is most
desirable that every physician should be aware of the clinical facts which
professor dejerine has accumulated in his vast experience  in gynaecology 
gastroenterology  cardiology   and genitounary disease the psychogenetic
affections are ignored by most physicians 

this book will give a better understanding of what every practitioner of
those specialities should be familiar with
