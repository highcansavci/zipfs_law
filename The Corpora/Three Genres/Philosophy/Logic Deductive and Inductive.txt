preface


in this edition of my  logic   the text has been revised throughout 
several passages have been rewritten  and some sections added  the chief
alterations and additions occur in cc 

the work may be considered  on the whole  as attached to the school of
mill  to whose  system of logic   and to bain s  logic   it is deeply
indebted  amongst the works of living writers  the  empirical logic  of
dr  venn and the  formal logic  of dr  keynes have given me most
assistance  to some others acknowledgments have been made as occasion
arose 

for the further study of contemporary opinion  accessible in english 
one may turn to such works as mr  bradley s  principles of logic   dr 
bosanquet s  logic  or the morphology of knowledge   prof  hobhouse s
 theory of knowledge   jevon s  principles of science   and sigwart s
 logic   ueberweg s  logic  and history of logical doctrine  is
invaluable for the history of our subject  the attitude toward logic of
the pragmatists or humanists may best be studied in dr  schiller s
 formal logic   and in mr  alfred sidgwick s  process of argument  and
recent  elementary logic   the second part of this last work  on the
 risks of reasoning   gives an admirably succinct account of their
position  i agree with the humanists that  in all argument  the
important thing to attend to is the meaning  and that the most serious
difficulties of reasoning occur in dealing with the matter reasoned
about  but i find that a pure science of relation has a necessary place
in the system of knowledge  and that the formul√¶ known as laws of
contradiction  syllogism and causation are useful guides in the framing
and testing of arguments and experiments concerning matters of fact 
incisive criticism of traditionary doctrines  with some remarkable
reconstructions  may be read in dr  mercier s  new logic  

in preparing successive editions of this book  i have profited by the
comments of my friends  mr  thomas whittaker  prof  claude thompson  dr 
armitage smith  mr  alfred sidgwick  dr  schiller  prof  spearman  and
prof  sully  have made important suggestions  and i might have profited
more by them  if the frame of my book  or my principles  had been more
elastic 

as to the present edition  useful criticisms have been received from mr 
s c  dutt  of cotton college  assam  and from prof  m a  roy  of
midnapore  and  especially  i must heartily thank my colleague  dr 
wolf  for communications that have left their impress upon nearly every
chapter

transition to induction

formal consistency and material truth                  
real general propositions assert more than has been
       directly observed                                             
hence  formally  a syllogism s premises seem to beg the
       conclusion                                                    
materially  a syllogism turns upon the resemblance of the
       minor to the middle term    and thus extends the
       major premise to new cases

       formal ground of all reasoning                              
grounds of our belief in uniformity                       


causation

the most important aspect of uniformity in relation to
       induction is causation                                      
definition of  cause  explained  five marks of causation        
how strictly the conception of cause can be applied
       depends upon the subject under investigation              
scientific conception of effect     plurality of causes         
some condition  but not the whole cause  may long precede
       the effect  and some co effect  but not the whole effect 
       may long survive the cause                                    
mechanical causes and the homogeneous intermixture of effects 
       chemical causes and the heteropathic intermixture of effects

perfect induction                                              
imperfect induction methodical or immethodical                 
observation and experiment  the material ground of
       induction  compared                                           
the principle of causation is the formal ground of induction   
the inductive canons are derived from the principle of
       causation  the more readily to detect it in facts observed    


the canons of direct induction

the canon of agreement

the canon of agreement in presence and in absence             
       it tends to disprove a plurality of causes 
the canon of difference                                   
       may be applied to observations  
the canon of variations

proof of hypotheses                                             
         must an hypothetical agent be directly observable   
          vera causa  
        an hypothesis must be adequate to its pretensions  
          exceptio probat regulam    
         every competing hypothesis must be excluded 
         crucial instance  
         hypotheses must agree with the laws of nature

logic




chapter i

introductory


  1  logic is the science that explains what conditions must be
fulfilled in order that a proposition may be proved  if it admits of
proof  not  indeed  every such proposition  for as to those that declare
the equality or inequality of numbers or other magnitudes  to explain
the conditions of their proof belongs to mathematics  they are said to
be  quantitative   but as to all other propositions  called
 qualitative   like most of those that we meet with in conversation  in
literature  in politics  and even in sciences so far as they are not
treated mathematically  say  botany and psychology   propositions that
merely tell us that something happens  as that  salt dissolves in
water    or that something has a certain property  as that  ice is
cold    as to these  it belongs to logic to show how we may judge
whether they are true  or false  or doubtful  when propositions are
expressed with the universality and definiteness that belong to
scientific statements  they are called laws  and laws  so far as they
are not laws of quantity  are tested by the principles of logic  if they
at all admit of proof 

but it is plain that the process of proving cannot go on for ever 
something must be taken for granted  and this is usually considered to
be the case  1  with particular facts that can only be perceived and
observed  and  2  with those highest laws that are called  axioms  or
 first principles   of which we can only say that we know of no
exceptions to them  that we cannot help believing them  and that they
are indispensable to science and to consistent thought  logic  then  may
be briefly defined as the science of proof with respect to  qualitative 
laws and propositions  except those that are axiomatic 

  2  proof may be of different degrees or stages of completeness 
absolute proof would require that a proposition should be shown to agree
with all experience and with the systematic explanation of experience 
to be a necessary part of an all embracing and self consistent
philosophy or theory of the universe  but as no one hitherto has been
able to frame such a philosophy  we must at present put up with
something less than absolute proof  logic  assuming certain principles
to be true of experience  or at least to be conditions of consistent
discourse  distinguishes the kinds of propositions that can be shown to
agree with these principles  and explains by what means the agreement
can best be exhibited  such principles are those of contradiction  chap 
vi    the syllogism  chap  ix    causation  chap  xiv    and
probabilities  chap  xx    to bring a proposition or an argument under
them  or to show that it agrees with them  is logical proof 

the extent to which proof is requisite  again  depends upon the present
purpose  if our aim be general truth for its own sake  a systematic
investigation is necessary  but if our object be merely to remove some
occasional doubt that has occurred to ourselves or to others  it may be
enough to appeal to any evidence that is admitted or not questioned 
thus  if a man doubts that  some acids are compounds of oxygen   but
grants that  some compounds of oxygen are acids   he may agree to the
former proposition when you point out that it has the same meaning as
the latter  differing from it only in the order of the words  this is
called proof by immediate inference 

again  suppose that a man holds in his hand a piece of yellow metal 
which he asserts to be copper  and that we doubt this  perhaps
suggesting that it is really gold  then he may propose to dip it in
vinegar  whilst we agree that  if it then turns green  it is copper and
not gold  on trying this experiment the metal does turn green  so that
we may put his argument in this way   

     whatever yellow metal turns green in vinegar is copper 
    this yellow metal turns green in vinegar 
    therefore  this yellow metal is copper  

such an argument is called proof by mediate inference  because one
cannot see directly that the yellow metal is copper  but it is admitted
that any yellow metal is copper that turns green in vinegar  and we are
shown that this yellow metal has that property 

now  however  it may occur to us  that the liquid in which the metal was
dipped was not vinegar  or not pure vinegar  and that the greenness was
due to the impurity  our friend must thereupon show by some means that
the vinegar was pure  and then his argument will be that  since nothing
but the vinegar came in contact with the metal  the greenness was due to
the vinegar  or  in other words  that contact with that vinegar was the
cause of the metal turning green 

still  on second thoughts  we may suspect that we had formerly conceded
too much  we may reflect that  although it had often been shown that
copper turned green in vinegar  whilst gold did not  yet the same might
not always happen  may it not be  we might ask  that just at this
moment  and perhaps always for the future gold turns  and will turn
green in vinegar  whilst copper does not and never will again  he will
probably reply that this is to doubt the uniformity of causation  he may
hope that we are not serious  he may point out to us that in every
action of our life we take such uniformity for granted  but he will be
obliged to admit that  whatever he may say to induce us to assent to the
principle of nature s uniformity  his arguments will not amount to
logical proof  because every argument in some way assumes that
principle  he has come  in fact  to the limits of logic  just as euclid
does not try to prove that  two magnitudes equal to the same third are
equal to one another   so the logician  as such  does not attempt to
prove the uniformity of causation and the other principles of his
science 

even when our purpose is to ascertain some general truth  the results of
systematic inquiry may have various degrees of certainty  if logic were
confined to strict demonstration  it would cover a narrow field  the
greater part of our conclusions can only be more or less probable  it
may  indeed  be maintained  not unreasonably  that no judgments
concerning matters of fact can be more than probable  some say that all
scientific results should be considered as giving the average of cases 
from which deviations are to be expected  many matters can only be
treated statistically and by the methods of probability  our ordinary
beliefs are adopted without any methodical examination  but it is the
aim  and it is characteristic  of a rational mind to distinguish degrees
of certainty  and to hold each judgment with the degree of confidence
that it deserves  considering the evidence for and against it  it takes
a long time  and much self discipline  to make some progress toward
rationality  for there are many causes of belief that are not good
grounds for it  have no value as evidence  evidence consists of  1 
observation   2  reasoning checked by observation and by logical
principles   3  memory  often inaccurate   4  testimony  often
untrustworthy  but indispensable  since all we learn from books or from
other men is taken on testimony   5  the agreement of all our results 
on the other hand  belief is caused by many influences that are not
evidence at all  such are  1  desire  which makes us believe in whatever
serves our purpose  fear and suspicion  which  paradoxically  make us
believe in whatever seems dangerous   2  habit  which resists whatever
disturbs our prejudices   3  vanity  which delights to think oneself
always right and consistent and disowns fallibility   4  imitativeness 
suggestibility  fashion  which carry us along with the crowd  all these 
and nobler things  such as love and fidelity  fix our attention upon
whatever seems to support our prejudices  and prevent our attending to
any facts or arguments that threaten to overthrow them 

  3  two departments of logic are usually recognised  deduction and
induction  that is  to describe them briefly  proof from principles  and
proof from facts  classification is sometimes made a third department 
sometimes its topics are distributed amongst those of the former two  in
the present work the order adopted is  deduction in chaps  ii  to xiii  
induction in chaps  xiii  to xx   and  lastly  classification  but such
divisions do not represent fundamentally distinct and opposed aspects of
the science  for although  in discussing any question with an opponent
who makes admissions  it may be possible to combat his views with merely
deductive arguments based upon his admissions  yet in any question of
general truth  induction and deduction are mutually dependent and imply
one another 

this may be seen in one of the above examples  it was argued that a
certain metal must be copper  because every metal is copper that turns
green when dipped in vinegar  so far the proof appealed to a general
proposition  and was deductive  but when we ask how the general
proposition is known to be true  experiments or facts must be alleged 
and this is inductive evidence  deduction then depends on induction  but
if we ask  again  how any number of past experiments can prove a general
proposition  which must be good for the future as well as for the past 
the uniformity of causation is invoked  that is  appeal is made to a
principle  and that again is deductive proof  induction then depends
upon deduction 

we may put it in this way  deduction depends on induction  if general
propositions are only known to us through the facts  induction depends
on deduction  because one fact can never prove another  except so far as
what is true of the one is true of the other and of any other of the
same kind  and because  to exhibit this resemblance of the facts  it
must be stated in a general proposition 

  4  the use of logic is often disputed  those who have not studied it 
often feel confident of their ability to do without it  those who have
studied it  are sometimes disgusted with what they consider to be its
superficial analysis of the grounds of evidence  or needless
technicality in the discussion of details  as to those who  not having
studied logic  yet despise it  there will be time enough to discuss its
utility with them  when they know something about it  and as for those
who  having studied it  turn away in disgust  whether they are justified
every man must judge for himself  when he has attained to equal
proficiency in the subject  meanwhile  the following considerations may
be offered in its favour 

logic states  and partly explains and applies  certain abstract
principles which all other sciences take for granted  namely  the axioms
above mentioned  the principles of contradiction  of the syllogism and
of causation  by exercising the student in the apprehension of these
truths  and in the application of them to particular propositions  it
educates the power of abstract thought  every science is a model of
method  a discipline in close and consecutive thinking  and this merit
logic ought to possess in a high degree 

for ages logic has served as an introduction to philosophy that is  to
metaphysics and speculative ethics  it is of old and honourable
descent  a man studies logic in very good company  it is the warp upon
which nearly the whole web of ancient  medi√¶val and modern philosophy is
woven  the history of thought is hardly intelligible without it 

as the science of proof  logic gives an account of the  general  nature
of evidence deductive and inductive  as applied in the physical and
social sciences and in the affairs of life  the  general  nature of such
evidence  it would be absurd of the logician to pretend to instruct the
chemist  economist and merchant  as to the  special  character of the
evidence requisite in their several spheres of judgment  still  by
investigating the general conditions of proof  he sets every man upon
his guard against the insufficiency of evidence 

one application of the science of proof deserves special mention 
namely  to that department of rhetoric which has been the most
developed  relating to persuasion by means of oratory  leader writing 
or pamphleteering  it is usually said that logic is useful to convince
the judgment  not to persuade the will  but one way of persuading the
will is to convince the judgment that a certain course is advantageous 
and although this is not always the readiest way  it is the most
honourable  and leads to the most enduring results  logic is the
backbone of rhetoric 

it has been disputed whether logic is a science or an art  and  in fact 
it may be considered in both ways  as a statement of general truths  of
their relations to one another  and especially to the first principles 
it is a science  but it is an art when  regarding truth as an end
desired  it points out some of the means of attaining it  namely  to
proceed by a regular method  to test every judgment by the principles of
logic  and to distrust whatever cannot be made consistent with them 
logic does not  in the first place  teach us to reason  we learn to
reason as we learn to walk and talk  by the natural growth of our powers
with some assistance from friends and neighbours  the way to develop
one s power of reasoning is  first  to set oneself problems and try to
solve them  secondly  since the solving of a problem depends upon one s
ability to call to mind parallel cases  one must learn as many facts as
possible  and keep on learning all one s life  for nobody ever knew
enough  thirdly one must check all results by the principles of logic 
it is because of this checking  verifying  corrective function of logic
that it is sometimes called a regulative or normative science  it cannot
give any one originality or fertility of invention  but it enables us to
check our inferences  revise our conclusions  and chasten the vagaries
of ambitious speculation  it quickens our sense of bad reasoning both in
others and in ourselves  a man who reasons deliberately  manages it
better after studying logic than he could before  if he is sincere about
it and has common sense 

  5  the relation of logic to other sciences 

 a  logic is regarded by spencer as co ordinate with mathematics  both
being abstract sciences  that is  sciences of the  relations  in which
things stand to one another  whatever the particular things may be that
are so related  and this view seems to be  on the whole  just  subject 
however  to qualifications that will appear presently 

mathematics treats of the relations of all sorts of things considered as
quantities  namely  as equal to  or greater or less than  one another 
things may be quantitatively equal or unequal in  degree   as in
comparing the temperature of bodies  or in  duration   or in  spatial
magnitude   as with lines  superficies  solids  or in  number   and it
is assumed that the equality or inequality of things that cannot be
directly compared  may be proved indirectly on the assumption that
 things equal to the same thing are equal   etc 

logic also treats of the relations of all sorts of things  but not as to
their quantity  it considers  i  that one thing may be like or unlike
another in certain attributes  as that iron is in many ways like tin or
lead  and in many ways unlike carbon or sulphur   ii  that attributes
co exist or coinhere  or do not  in the same subject  as metallic
lustre  hardness  a certain atomic weight and a certain specific gravity
coinhere in iron  and  iii  that one event follows another  or is the
effect of it   as that the placing of iron in water causes it to rust 
the relations of likeness and of coinherence are the ground of
classification  for it is by resemblance of coinhering attributes that
things form classes  coinherence is the ground of judgments concerning
substance and attribute  as that iron is metallic  and the relation of
succession  in the mode of causation  is the chief subject of the
department of induction  it is usual to group together these relations
of attributes and of order in time  and call them qualitative  in order
to contrast them with the quantitative relations which belong to
mathematics  and it is assumed that qualitative relations of things 
when they cannot be directly perceived  may be proved indirectly by
assuming the axiom of the syllogism  chap  ix   and the law of causation
 chap  xiv   

so far  then  logic and mathematics appear to be co ordinate and
distinct sciences  but we shall see hereafter that the satisfactory
treatment of that special order of events in time which constitutes
causation  requires a combination of logic with mathematics  and so does
the treatment of probability  and  again  logic may be said to be  in a
certain sense   prior to  or  above  mathematics as usually treated  for
the mathematics assume that one magnitude must be either equal or
unequal to another  and that it cannot be both equal and unequal to it 
and thus take for granted the principles of contradiction and excluded
middle  but the statement and elucidation of these principles are left
to logic  chap  vi    the mathematics also classify and define
magnitudes  as  in geometry  triangles  squares  cubes  spheres  but the
principles of classification and definition remain for logic to
discuss 

 b  as to the concrete sciences  such as astronomy  chemistry  zoology 
sociology  logic  as well as mathematics  is implied in them all  for
all the propositions of which they consist involve causation 
co existence  and class likeness  logic is therefore said to be prior to
them or above them  meaning by  prior  not that it should be studied
earlier  for that is not a good plan  meaning by  above  not in dignity 
for distinctions of dignity amongst liberal studies are absurd  but it
is a philosophical idiom to call the abstract  prior to   or  higher
than   the concrete  see porphyry s tree  chap  xxii    8   and logic is
more abstract than astronomy or sociology  philosophy may thank that
idiom for many a foolish notion 

 c  but  as we have seen  logic does not investigate the truth 
trustworthiness  or validity of its own principles  nor does
mathematics  this task belongs to metaphysics  or epistemology  the
criticism of knowledge and beliefs 

logic assumes  for example  that things are what to a careful scrutiny
they seem to be  that animals  trees  mountains  planets  are bodies
with various attributes  existing in space and changing in time  and
that certain principles  such as contradiction and causation  are true
of things and events  but metaphysicians have raised many plausible
objections to these assumptions  it has been urged that natural objects
do not really exist on their own account  but only in dependence on some
mind that contemplates them  and that even space and time are only our
way of perceiving things  or  again  that although things do really
exist on their own account  it is in an entirely different way from that
in which we know them  as to the principle of contradiction  that if an
object has an attribute  it cannot at the same time and in the same way
be without it  e g   if an animal is conscious  it is false that it is
not conscious   it has been contended that the speciousness of this
principle is only due to the obtuseness of our minds  or even to the
poverty of language  which cannot make the fine distinctions that exist
in nature  and as to causation  it is sometimes doubted whether events
always have physical causes  and it is often suggested that  granting
they have physical causes  yet these are such as we can neither perceive
nor conceive  belonging not to the order of nature as we know it  but to
the secret inwardness and reality of nature  to the wells and reservoirs
of power  not to the spray of the fountain that glitters in our
eyes   occult causes   in short  now these doubts and surmises are
metaphysical spectres which it remains for metaphysics to lay  logic has
no direct concern with them  although  of course  metaphysical
discussion is expected to be logical   but keeps the plain path of plain
beliefs  level with the comprehension of plain men  metaphysics  as
examining the grounds of logic itself  is sometimes regarded as  the
higher logic   and  certainly  the study of metaphysics is necessary to
every one who would comprehend the nature and functions of logic  or the
place of his own mind and of reason in the world 

 d  the relation of logic to psychology will be discussed in the next
section 

 e  as a regulative science  pointing out the conditions of true
inference  within its own sphere   logic is co ordinate with  i  ethics 
considered as assigning the conditions of right conduct  and with  ii 
√¶sthetics  considered as determining the principles of criticism and
good taste 

  6  three principal schools of logicians are commonly recognised 
nominalist  conceptualist  and materialist  who differ as to what it is
that logic really treats of  the nominalists say   of language   the
conceptualists   of thought   the materialists   of relations of fact  
to illustrate these positions let us take authors who  if some of them
are now neglected  have the merit of stating their contrasted views with
a distinctness that later refinements tend to obscure 

 a  whately  a well known nominalist  regarded logic as the science and
art of reasoning  but at the same time as  entirely conversant about
language   that is to say  it is the business of logic to discover those
modes of statement which shall ensure the cogency of an argument  no
matter what may be the subject under discussion  thus   all fish are
cold blooded   ‚à¥  some cold blooded things are fish   this is a sound
inference by the mere manner of expression  and equally sound is the
inference   all fish are warm blooded   ‚à¥  some warm blooded things are
fish   the latter proposition may be false  but it follows  and
 according to this doctrine  logic is only concerned with the consistent
use of words  the truth or falsity of the proposition itself is a
question for zoology  the short coming of extreme nominalism lies in
speaking of language as if its meaning were unimportant  but whately did
not intend this  he was a man of great penetration and common sense 

 b  hamilton  our best known conceptualist  defined logic as the science
of the  formal laws of thought   and  of thought as thought   that is 
without regard to the matter thought about  just as whately regarded
logic as concerned merely with cogent forms of statement  so hamilton
treated it as concerned merely with the necessary relations of thought 
this doctrine is called conceptualism  because the simplest element of
thought is the concept  that is  an abstract idea  such as is signified
by the word  man  planet  colour  virtue   not a representative or
generic image  but the thought of all attributes common to any class of
things  men  planets  colours  virtuous actions or characters  have 
severally  something in common on account of which they bear these
general names  and the thought of what they have in common  as the
ground of these names  is a concept  to affirm or deny one concept of
another  as  some men are virtuous   or  no man is perfectly virtuous  
is to form a judgment  corresponding to the proposition of which the
other schools of logic discourse  conceptualism  then  investigates the
conditions of consistent judgment 

to distinguish logic from psychology is most important in connection
with conceptualism  concepts and judgments being mental acts  or
products of mental activity  it is often thought that logic must be a
department of psychology  it is recognised of course  that psychology
deals with much more than logic does  with sensation  pleasure and pain 
emotion  volition  but in the region of the intellect  especially in its
most deliberate and elaborate processes  namely  conception  judgment 
and reasoning  logic and psychology seem to occupy common ground  in
fact  however  the two sciences have little in common except a few
general terms  and even these they employ in different senses  it is
usual to point out that psychology tries to explain the subjective
 processes  of conception  judgment and reasoning  and to give their
natural history  but that logic is wholly concerned with the  results 
of such processes  with concepts  judgments and reasonings  and merely
with the validity of the results  that is  with their truth or
consistency  whilst psychology has nothing to do with their validity 
but only with their causes  besides  the logical judgment  in formal
logic at least  is quite a different thing from the psychological  the
latter involves feeling and belief  whereas the former is merely a given
relation of concepts   s is p   that is a model logical judgment  there
can be no question of believing it  but it is logically valid if  m is
p  and  s is m   when  again  in logic  one deals with belief  it
depends upon evidence  whereas  in psychology belief is shown to depend
upon causes which may have evidentiary value or may not  for psychology
explains quite impartially the growth of scientific insight and the
growth of prejudice 

 c  mill  bain  and venn are the chief materialist logicians  and to
guard against the error of confounding materialism in logic with the
ontological doctrine that nothing exists but matter  it may suffice to
remember that in metaphysics all these philosophers are idealists 
materialism in logic consists in regarding propositions as affirming or
denying relations   cf     5  between matters of fact in the widest
sense  not only physical facts  but ideas  social and moral relations 
it consists  in short  in attending to the meaning of propositions  it
treats the first principles of contradiction and causation as true of
things so far as they are known to us  and not merely as conditions or
tendencies of thought  and it takes these principles as conditions of
right thinking  because they seem to hold good of nature and human life 

to these differences of opinion it will be necessary to recur in the
next chapter    4   but here i may observe that it is easy to exaggerate
their importance in logic  there is really little at issue between
schools of logicians as such  and as far as their doctrines run
parallel  it is on the metaphysical grounds of their study  or as to its
scope and comprehension  that they find a battle field  the present work
generally proceeds upon the third  or materialist doctrine  if deduction
and induction are regarded as mutually dependent parts of one science 
uniting the discipline of consistent discourse with the method of
investigating laws of physical phenomena  the materialist doctrine  that
the principles of logic are founded on fact  seems to be the most
natural way of thinking  but if the unity of deduction and induction is
not disputed by the other schools  the materialist may regard them as
allies exhibiting in their own way the same body of truths  the
nominalist may certainly claim that his doctrine is indispensable 
consistently cogent forms of statement are necessary both to the
conceptualist and to the materialist  neither the relations of thought
nor those of fact can be arrested or presented without the aid of
language or some equivalent system of signs  the conceptualist may urge
that the nominalist s forms of statement and argument exist for the sake
of their meaning  namely  judgments and reasonings  and that the
materialist s laws of nature are only judgments founded upon our
conceptions of nature  that the truth of observations and experiments
depends upon our powers of perception  that perception is inseparable
from understanding  and that a system of induction may be constructed
upon the axiom of causation  regarded as a principle of reason  just as
well as by considering it as a law of nature  and upon much the same
lines  the materialist  admitting all this  may say that a judgment is
only the proximate meaning of a proposition  and that the ultimate
meaning  the meaning of the judgment itself  is always some
matter of fact  that the other schools have not hitherto been eager to
recognise the unity of deduction and induction or to investigate the
conditions of trustworthy experiments and observations within the limits
of human understanding  that thought is itself a sort of fact  as
complex in its structure  as profound in its relations  as subtle in its
changes as any other fact  and therefore at least as hard to know  that
to turn away from the full reality of thought in perception  and to
confine logic to artificially limited concepts  is to abandon the effort
to push method to the utmost and to get as near truth as possible  and
that as to causation being a principle of reason rather than of nature 
the distinction escapes his apprehension  since nature seems to be that
to which our private minds turn upon questions of causation for

general analysis of propositions


  1  since logic discusses the proof or disproof  or  briefly  the
testing of propositions  we must begin by explaining their nature  a
proposition  then  may first be described in the language of grammar as
 a sentence indicative   and it is usually expressed in the present
tense 

it is true that other kinds of sentences  optative  imperative 
interrogative  exclamatory  if they express or imply an assertion  are
not beyond the view of logic  but before treating such sentences  logic 
for greater precision  reduces them to their equivalent sentences
indicative  thus   i wish it were summer  may be understood to mean 
 the coming of summer is an object of my desire    thou shalt not kill 
may be interpreted as  murderers are in danger of the judgment  
interrogatories  when used in argument  if their form is affirmative 
have negative force  and affirmative force if their form is negative 
thus   do hypocrites love virtue   anticipates the answer   no    are
not traitors the vilest of mankind   anticipates the answer   yes   so
that the logical form of these sentences is   hypocrites are not lovers
of virtue    traitors are the vilest of mankind   impersonal
propositions  such as  it rains   are easily rendered into logical forms
of equivalent meaning  thus   rain is falling   or  if that be
tautology    the clouds are raining   exclamations may seem capricious 
but are often part of the argument   shade of chatham   usually means
 chatham  being aware of our present foreign policy  is much
disgusted   it is in fact  an appeal to authority  without the
inconvenience of stating what exactly it is that the authority declares 

  2  but even sentences indicative may not be expressed in the way most
convenient to logicians   salt dissolves in water  is a plain enough
statement  but the logician prefers to have it thus   salt is soluble in
water   for he says that a proposition is analysable into three
elements   1  a subject  as  salt   about which something is asserted or
denied   2  a predicate  as  soluble in water   which is asserted or
denied of the subject  and  3  the copula   is  or  are   or  is not  or
 are not    the sign of relation between the subject and predicate  the
subject and predicate are called the terms of the proposition  and the
copula may be called the sign of predication  using the verb  to
predicate  indefinitely for either  to affirm  or  to deny   thus  s is
p  means that the term  p  is given as related in some way to the term
 s   we may  therefore  further define a proposition as  a sentence in
which one term is predicated of another  

in such a proposition as  salt dissolves   the copula   is   is
contained in the predicate  and  besides the subject  only one element
is exhibited  it is therefore said to be  secundi adjacentis   when all
three parts are exhibited  as in  salt is soluble   the proposition is
said to be  tertii adjacentis  

for the ordinary purposes of logic  in predicating attributes of a thing
or class of things  the copula  is   or  is not   sufficiently
represents the relation of subject and predicate  but when it is
desirable to realise fully the nature of the relation involved  it may
be better to use a more explicit form  instead of saying
 salt  is  soluble   we may say  solubility  coinheres with  the nature
of salt   or  the putting of salt in water  is a cause of  its
dissolving   thus expanding the copula into a full expression of the
relation we have in view  whether coinherence or causation 

  3  the sentences of ordinary discourse are  indeed  for the most
part  longer and more complicated than the logical form of propositions 
it is in order to prove them  or to use them in the proof of other
propositions  that they are in logic reduced as nearly as possible to
such simple but explicit expressions as the above   tertii adjacentis   
a compound proposition  reducible to two or more simple ones  is said to
be exponible 

the modes of compounding sentences are explained in every grammar book 
one of the commonest forms is the copulative  such as  salt is both
savoury and wholesome   equivalent to two simple propositions   salt is
savoury  salt is wholesome  pure water is neither sapid nor odorous  
equivalent to  water is not sapid  water is not odorous   or  again 
 tobacco is injurious  but not when used in moderation   equivalent to
 much tobacco is injurious  a little is not  

another form of exponible is the exceptive  as  kladderadatsch is
published daily  except on week days   equivalent to  kladderadatsch is
published on sunday  it is not published any other day   still another
exponible is the exclusive  as  only men use fire   equivalent to  men
are users of fire  no other animals are   exceptive and exclusive
sentences are  however  equivalent forms  for we may say 
 kladderadatsch is published only on sunday   and  no animals use fire 
except men  

there are other compound sentences that are not exponible  since  though
they contain two or more verbal clauses  the construction shows that
these are inseparable  thus   if cats are scarce  mice are plentiful  
contains two verbal clauses  but  if cats are scarce  is conditional 
not indicative  and  mice are plentiful  is subject to the condition
that  cats are scarce   hence the whole sentence is called a conditional
proposition  for the various forms of conditional propositions see chap 
v    4 

but  in fact  to find the logical force of recognised grammatical forms
is the least of a logician s difficulties in bringing the discourses of
men to a plain issue  metaphors  epigrams  innuendoes and other figures
of speech present far greater obstacles to a lucid reduction whether for
approval or refutation  no rules can be given for finding everybody s
meaning  the poets have their own way of expressing themselves 
sophists  too  have their own way  and the point often lies in what is
unexpressed  thus   barbarous nations make  the civilised write
history   means that civilised nations do not make history  which none
is so brazen as openly to assert  or  again   alcibiades is dead  but x
is still with us   the whole meaning of this  exponible  is that x would
be the lesser loss to society  even an epithet or a suffix may imply a
proposition   this personage  may mean  x is a pretentious nobody  

how shall we interpret such illusive predications except by cultivating
our literary perceptions  by reading the most significant authors until
we are at home with them  but  no doubt  to disentangle the compound
propositions  and to expand the abbreviations of literature and
conversation  is a useful logical exercise  and if it seem a laborious
task thus to reduce to its logical elements a long argument in a speech
or treatise  it should be observed that  as a rule  in a long discourse
only a few sentences are of principal importance to the reasoning  the
rest being explanatory or illustrative digression  and that a close
scrutiny of these cardinal sentences will frequently dispense us from
giving much attention to the rest 

  4  but now  returning to the definition of a proposition given in   2 
that it is  a sentence in which one term is predicated of another   we
must consider what is the import of such predication  for the
definition  as it stands  seems to be purely nominalist  is a
proposition nothing more than a certain synthesis of words  or  is it
meant to correspond with something further  a synthesis of ideas  or a
relation of facts 

conceptualist logicians  who speak of judgments instead of
propositions  of course define the judgment in their own language 
according to hamilton  it is  a recognition of the relation of
congruence or confliction in which two concepts stand to each other   to
lighten the sentence  i have omitted one or two qualifications
 hamilton s  lectures on logic   xiii     thus   he goes on  if we
compare the thoughts  water    iron   and  rusting   we find them
congruent  and connect them into a single thought  thus   water rusts
iron   in that case we form a judgment   when a judgment is expressed in
words  he says  it is called a proposition 

but has a proposition no meaning beyond the judgment it expresses  mill 
who defines it as  a portion of discourse in which a predicate is
affirmed or denied of a subject    logic   book 1   chap  iv    1   
proceeds to inquire into the import of propositions  book 1   chap  v   
and finds three classes of them   a  those in which one proper name is
predicated of another  and of these hobbes s nominalist definition is
adequate  namely  that a proposition asserts or denies that the
predicate is a name for the same thing as the subject  as  tully is
cicero  

 b  propositions in which the predicate means a part  or the whole  of
what the subject means  as  horses are animals    man is a rational
animal   these are verbal propositions  see below  chap  v    6   and
their import consists in affirming or denying a coincidence between the
meanings of names  as  the meaning of  animal  is part of the meaning of
 horse    they are partial or complete definitions 

but  c  there are also real propositions  whose predicates do not mean
the same as their subjects  and whose import consists in affirming or
denying one of five different kinds of matter of fact   1  that the
subject exists  or does not  as if we say  the bison exists    the great
auk is extinct    2  co existence  as  man is mortal   that is   the
being subject to death coinheres with the qualities on account of which
we call certain objects men    3  succession  as  night follows day  
 4  causation  a particular kind of succession   as  water rusts iron  
 5  resemblance  as  the colour of this geranium is like that of a
soldier s coat   or  a = b  

on comparing this list of real predications with the list of logical
relations given above  chap  i    5  a    it will be seen that the two
differ only in this  that i have there omitted simple existence  nothing
simply exists  unrelated either in nature or in knowledge  such a
proposition as  the bison exists  may  no doubt  be used in logic
 subject to interpretation  for the sake of custom or for the sake of
brevity  but it means that some specimens are still to be found in n 
america  or in zoological gardens 

controversy as to the import of propositions really turns upon a
difference of opinion as to the scope of logic and the foundations of
knowledge  mill was dissatisfied with the  congruity  of concepts as the
basis of a judgment  clearly  mere congruity does not justify belief  in
the proposition  water rusts iron   the concepts  water    rust  and
 iron  may be congruous  but does any one assert their connection on
that ground  in the proposition  murderers are haunted by the ghosts of
their victims   the concepts  victim    murderer    ghost  have a high
degree of congruity  yet  unfortunately  i cannot believe it  there
seems to be no such cheap defence of innocence  now  mill held that
logic is concerned with the grounds of belief  and that the scope of
logic includes induction as well as deduction  whereas  according to
hamilton  induction is only modified logic  a mere appendix to the
theory of the  forms of thought as thought   indeed  mill endeavoured in
his  logic  to probe the grounds of belief deeper than usual  and
introduced a good deal of metaphysics  either too much or not
enough  concerning the ground of axioms  but  at any rate  his great
point was that belief  and therefore  for the most part  the real
proposition  is concerned not merely with the relations of words  or
even of ideas  but with matters of fact  that is  both propositions and
judgments point to something further  to the relations of things which
we can examine  not merely by thinking about them  comparing them in
thought   but by observing them with the united powers of thought and
perception  this is what convinces us that  water rusts iron   and the
difficulty of doing this is what prevents our feeling sure that
 murderers are haunted by the ghosts of their victims   hence  although
mill s definition of a proposition  given above  is adequate for
propositions in general  yet that kind of proposition  the real  with
regard to which logic  in mill s view  investigates the conditions of
proof  may be more explicitly and pertinently defined as  a predication
concerning the relation of matters of fact  

  5  this leads to a very important distinction to which we shall often
have to refer in subsequent pages  namely  the distinction between the
form and the matter of a proposition or of an argument  the distinction
between form and matter  as it is ordinarily employed  is easily
understood  an apple growing in the orchard and a waxen apple on the
table may have the same shape or form  but they consist of different
materials  two real apples may have the same shape  but contain distinct
ounces of apple stuff  so that after one is eaten the other remains to
be eaten  similarly  tables may have the same shape  though one be made
of marble  another of oak  another of iron  the form is common to
several things  the matter is peculiar to each  metaphysicians have
carried the distinction further  apples  they say  may have not only the
same outward shape  but the same inward constitution  which  therefore 
may be called the form of apple stuff itself  namely  a certain
pulpiness  juiciness  sweetness  etc   qualities common to all dessert
apples  yet their matter is different  one being here  another
there  differing in place or time  if in nothing else  the definition of
a species is the form of every specimen of it 

to apply this distinction to the things of logic  it is easy to see how
two propositions may have the same form but different matter  not using
 form  in the sense of  shape   but for that which is common to many
things  in contrast with that which is peculiar to each  thus   all male
lions are tawny  and  all water is liquid at 50¬∞ fahrenheit   are two
propositions that have the same form  though their matter is entirely
different  they both predicate something of the whole of their subjects 
though their subjects are different  and so are the things predicated of
them  again   all male lions have tufted tails  and  all male lions have
manes   are two propositions having the same form and  in their
subjects  the same matter  but different matter in their predicates  if 
however  we take two such propositions as these   all male lions have
manes  and  some male lions have manes   here the matter is the same in
both  but the form is different  in the first  predication is made
concerning  every  male lion  in the second of only  some  male lions 
the first is  universal   the second is  particular   or  again  if we
take  some tigers are man eaters  and  some tigers are not man eaters  
here too the matter is the same  but the form is different  for the
first proposition is  affirmative   whilst the second is  negative  

  6  now  according to hamilton and whately  pure logic has to do only
with the form of propositions and arguments  as to their matter  whether
they are really true in fact  that is a question  they said  not for
logic  but for experience  or for the special sciences  but mill desired
so to extend logical method as to test the material truth of
propositions  he thought that he could expound a method by which
experience itself and the conclusions of the special sciences may be
examined 

to this method it may be objected  that the claim to determine material
truth takes for granted that the order of nature will remain unchanged 
that  for example  water not only at present is a liquid at 50¬∞
fahrenheit  but will always be so  whereas  although we have no reason
to expect such a thing  the order of nature may alter  it is at least
supposable  and in that event water may freeze at such a temperature 
any matter of fact  again  must depend on observation  either directly 
or by inference  as when something is asserted about atoms or ether  but
observation and material inference are subject to the limitations of our
faculties  and however we may aid observation by microscopes and
micrometers  it is still observation  and however we may correct our
observations by repetition  comparison and refined mathematical methods
of making allowances  the correction of error is only an approximation
to accuracy  outside of formal reasoning  suspense of judgment is your
only attitude 

but such objections imply that nothing short of absolute truth has any
value  that all our discussions and investigations in science or social
affairs are without logical criteria  that logic must be confined to
symbols  and considered entirely as mental gymnastics  in this book
prominence will be given to the character of logic as a formal science 
and it will also be shown that induction itself may be treated formally 
but it will be assumed that logical forms are valuable as representing
the actual relations of natural and social phenomena 

  7  symbols are often used in logic instead of concrete terms  not only
in symbolic logic where the science is treated algebraically  as by dr 
venn in his  symbolic logic    but in ordinary manuals  so that it may
be well to explain the use of them before going further 

it is a common and convenient practice to illustrate logical doctrines
by examples  to show what is meant by a proposition we may give  salt is
soluble   or  water rusts iron   the copulative exponible is exemplified
by  salt is savoury and wholesome   and so on  but this procedure has
some disadvantages  it is often cumbrous  and it may distract the
reader s attention from the point to be explained by exciting his
interest in the special fact of the illustration  clearly  too  so far
as logic is formal  no particular matter of fact can adequately
illustrate any of its doctrines  accordingly  writers on logic employ
letters of the alphabet instead of concrete terms   say   x  instead of
 salt  or instead of  iron   and  say   y  instead of  soluble  or
instead of  rusted by water   and then a proposition may be represented
by  x is y   it is still more usual to represent a proposition by  s is
 or is not  p  s  being the initial of subject and  p  of predicate 
though this has the drawback that if we argue   s is p   therefore  p is
s   the symbols in the latter proposition no longer have the same
significance  since the former subject is now the predicate 

again  negative terms frequently occur in logic  such as  not water   or
 not iron   and then if  water  or  iron  be expressed by  x   the
corresponding negative may be expressed by  x   or  generally  if a
capital letter stand for a positive term  the corresponding small letter
represents the negative  the same device may be adopted to express
contradictory terms  either of them being  x   the other is  x   see
chap  iv      7 8   or the contradictory terms may be expressed by  x 
and  xÃÑ    y  and  yÃÑ  

and as terms are often compounded  it may be convenient to express them
by a combination of letters  instead of illustrating such a case by
 boiling water  or  water that is boiling   we may write  xy   or since
positive and negative terms may be compounded  instead of illustrating
this by  water that is not boiling   we may write  xy  

the convenience of this is obvious  but it is more than convenient  for 
if one of the uses of logic be to discipline the power of abstract
thought  this can be done far more effectually by symbolic than by
concrete examples  and if such discipline were the only use of logic it
might be best to discard concrete illustrations altogether  at least in
advanced text books  though no doubt the practice would be too severe
for elementary manuals  on the other hand  to show the practical
applicability of logic to the arguments and proofs of actual life  or
even of the concrete sciences  merely symbolic illustration may be not
only useless but even misleading  when we speak of politics  or poetry 
or species  or the weather  the terms that must be used can rarely have
the distinctness and isolation of x and y  so that the perfunctory use
of symbolic illustration makes argument and proof appear to be much
simpler and easier matters than they really are  our belief in any
proposition never rests on the proposition itself  nor merely upon one
or two others  but upon the immense background of our general knowledge
and beliefs  full of circumstances and analogies  in relation to which
alone any given proposition is intelligible  indeed  for this reason  it
is impossible to illustrate logic sufficiently  the reader who is in
earnest about the cogency of arguments and the limitation of proofs  and
is scrupulous as to the degrees of assent that they require  must
constantly look for illustrations in his own knowledge and experience
and rely at last upon his own sagacity 




chapter iii

of terms and their denotation


  1  in treating of deductive logic it is usual to recognise three
divisions of the subject  first  the doctrine of terms  words  or other
signs used as subjects or predicates  secondly  the doctrine of
propositions  analysed into terms related  and  thirdly  the doctrine of
the syllogism in which propositions appear as the grounds of a
conclusion 

the terms employed are either letters of the alphabet  or the words of
common language  or the technicalities of science  and since the words
of common language are most in use  it is necessary to give some account
of common language as subserving the purposes of logic  it has been
urged that we cannot think or reason at all without words  or some
substitute for them  such as the signs of algebra  but this is an
exaggeration  minds greatly differ  and some think by the aid of
definite and comprehensive picturings  especially in dealing with
problems concerning objects in space  as in playing chess blindfold 
inventing a machine  planning a tour on an imagined map  most people
draw many simple inferences by means of perceptions  or of mental
imagery  on the other hand  some men think a good deal without any
continuum of words and without any imagery  or with none that seems
relevant to the purpose  still the more elaborate sort of thinking  the
grouping and concatenation of inferences  which we call reasoning 
cannot be carried far without language or some equivalent system of
signs  it is not merely that we need language to express our reasonings
and communicate them to others  in solitary thought we often depend on
words   talk to ourselves   in fact  though the words or sentences that
then pass through our minds are not always fully formed or articulated 
in logic  moreover  we have carefully to examine the grounds  at least
the proximate grounds  of our conclusions  and plainly this cannot be
done unless the conclusions in question are explicitly stated and
recorded 

conceptualists say that logic deals not with the process of thinking
 which belongs to psychology  but with its results  not with conceiving
but with concepts  not with judging but with judgments  is the concept
self consistent or adequate  logic asks  is the judgment capable of
proof  now  it is only by recording our thoughts in language that it
becomes possible to distinguish between the process and the result of
thought  without language  the act and the product of thinking would be
identical and equally evanescent  but by carrying on the process in
language and remembering or otherwise recording it  we obtain a result
which may be examined according to the principles of logic 

  2  as logic  then  must give some account of language  it seems
desirable to explain how its treatment of language differs from that of
grammar and from that of rhetoric 

grammar is the study of the words of some language  their classification
and derivation  and of the rules of combining them  according to the
usage at any time recognised and followed by those who are considered
correct writers or speakers  composition may be faultless in its
grammar  though dull and absurd 

rhetoric is the study of language with a view to obtaining some special
effect in the communication of ideas or feelings  such as
picturesqueness in description  vivacity in narration  lucidity in
exposition  vehemence in persuasion  or literary charm  some of these
ends are often gained in spite of faulty syntax or faulty logic  but
since the few whom bad grammar saddens or incoherent arguments divert
are not carried away  as they else might be  by an unsophisticated
orator  grammar and logic are necessary to the perfection of rhetoric 
not that rhetoric is in bondage to those other sciences  for foreign
idioms and such figures as the ellipsis  the anacoluthon  the oxymoron 
the hyperbole  and violent inversions have their place in the
magnificent style  but authors unacquainted with grammar and logic are
not likely to place such figures well and wisely  indeed  common idioms 
though both grammatically and rhetorically justifiable  both correct and
effective  often seem illogical   to fall asleep   for example  is a
perfect english phrase  yet if we examine severally the words it
consists of  it may seem strange that their combination should mean
anything at all 

but logic only studies language so far as necessary in order to state 
understand  and check the evidence and reasonings that are usually
embodied in language  and as long as meanings are clear  good logic is
compatible with false concords and inelegance of style 

  3  terms are either simple or composite  that is to say  they may
consist either of a single word  as  chaucer    civilisation   or of
more than one  as  the father of english poetry   or  modern civilised
nations   logicians classify words according to their uses in forming
propositions  or  rather  they classify the uses of words as terms  not
the words themselves  for the same word may fall into different classes
of terms according to the way in which it is used   cf  mr  alfred
sidgwick s  distinction and the criticism of beliefs   chap  xiv  

thus words are classified as categorematic or syncategorematic  a word
is categorematic if used singly as a term without the support of other
words  it is syncategorematic when joined with other words in order to
constitute the subject or predicate of a proposition  if we say  venus
is a planet whose orbit is inside the earth s   the subject   venus  
is a word used categorematically as a simple term  the predicate is a
composite term whose constituent words  whether substantive  relative 
verb  or preposition  are used syncategorematically 

prepositions  conjunctions  articles  adverbs  relative pronouns  in
their ordinary use  can only enter into terms along with other words
having a substantive  adjectival or participial force  but when they are
themselves the things spoken of and are used substantively   suppositio
materialis    they are categorematic  in the proposition    of  was used
more indefinitely three hundred years ago than it is now    of  is
categorematic  on the other hand  all substantives may be used
categorematically  and the same self sufficiency is usually recognised
in adjectives and participles  some  however  hold that the
categorematic use of adjectives and participles is due to an ellipsis
which the logician should fill up  that instead of  gold is heavy   he
should say  gold is a heavy metal   instead of  the sun is shining  
 the sun is a body shining   but in these cases the words  metal  and
 body  are unmistakable tautology  since  metal  is implied in gold and
 body  in sun  but  as we have seen  any of these kinds of word 
substantive  adjective  or participle  may occur syncategorematically in
connection with others to form a composite term 

  4  most terms  the exceptions and doubtful cases will be discussed
hereafter  have two functions  a denotative and a connotative  a term s
denotative function is  to be the name or sign of something or some
multitude of things  which are said to be called or denoted by the term 
its connotative function is  to suggest certain qualities and
characteristics of the things denoted  so that it cannot be used
literally as the name of any other things  which qualities and
characteristics are said to be implied or connoted by the term  thus
 sheep  is the name of certain animals  and its connotation prevents its
being used of any others  that which a term directly indicates  then 
is its  denotation   that sense or customary use of it which limits the
denotation is its  connotation   ch  iv    hamilton and others use
 extension  in the sense of denotation  and  intension  or
 comprehension  in the sense of connotation  now  terms may be
classified  first according to what they stand for or denote  that is 
according to their  denotation   in this respect  the use of a term is
said to be either concrete or abstract 

a term is concrete when it denotes a  thing   that is  any person 
object  fact  event  feeling or imagination  considered as capable of
having  or consisting of  qualities and a determinate existence  thus
 cricket ball  denotes any object having a certain size  weight  shape 
colour  etc   which are its qualities   and being at any given time in
some place and related to other objects  in the bowler s hands  on the
grass  in a shop window  any  feeling of heat  has a certain intensity 
is pleasurable or painful  occurs at a certain time  and affects some
part or the whole of some animal  an imagination  indeed  say  of a
fairy   cannot be said in the same sense to have locality  but it
depends on the thinking of some man who has locality  and is definitely
related to his other thoughts and feelings 

a term is abstract  on the other hand  when it denotes a quality  or
qualities   considered by itself and without determinate existence in
time  place  or relation to other things   size    shape    weight  
 colour    intensity    pleasurableness   are terms used to denote such
qualities  and are then abstract in their denotation   weight  is not
something with a determinate existence at a given time  it exists not
merely in some particular place  but wherever there is a heavy thing 
and  as to relation  at the same moment it combines in iron with
solidity and in mercury with liquidity  in fact  a quality is a point of
agreement in a multitude of different things  all heavy things agree in
weight  all round things in roundness  all red things in redness  and an
abstract term denotes such a point  or points  of agreement among the
things denoted by concrete terms  abstract terms result from the
analysis of concrete things into their qualities  and conversely a
concrete term may be viewed as denoting the synthesis of qualities into
an individual thing  when several things agree in more than one quality 
there may be an abstract term denoting the union of qualities in which
they agree  and omitting their peculiarities  as  human nature  denotes
the common qualities of men   civilisation  the common conditions of
civilised peoples 

every general name  if used as a concrete term  has  or may have  a
corresponding abstract term  sometimes the concrete term is modified to
form the abstract  as  greedy  greediness   sometimes a word is adapted
from another language  as  man  humanity   sometimes a composite term is
used  as  mercury  the nature of mercury   etc  the same concrete may
have several abstract correlatives  as  man  manhood  humanity  human
nature    heavy  weight  gravity  ponderosity   but in such cases the
abstract terms are not used quite synonymously  that is  they imply
different ways of considering the concrete 

whether a word is used as a concrete or abstract term is in most
instances plain from the word itself  the use of most words being pretty
regular one way or the other  but sometimes we must judge by the
context   weight  may be used in the abstract for  gravity   or in the
concrete for a measure  but in the latter sense it is syncategorematic
 in the singular   needing at least the article  a  or the  weight  
 government  may mean  supreme political authority   and is then
abstract  or  the men who happen to be ministers  and is then concrete 
but in this case  too  the article is usually prefixed   the life  of
any man may mean his vitality  abstract   as in  thus following life in
creatures we dissect   or  the series of events through which he passes
 concrete   as in  the life of nelson as narrated by southey  

it has been made a question whether the denotation of an abstract term
may itself be the subject of qualities  apparently  weight  may be
greater or less   government  good or bad   vitality  intense or dull 
but if every subject is modified by a quality  a quality is also
modified by making it the subject of another  and  if so  it seems then
to become a new quality  the compound terms  great weight    bad
government    dull vitality   have not the same denotation as the simple
terms  weight   government    vitality   they imply  and may be said to
connote  more special concrete experience  such as the effort felt in
lifting a trunk  disgust at the conduct of officials  sluggish movements
of an animal when irritated  it is to such concrete experiences that we
have always to refer in order fully to realise the meaning of abstract
terms  and therefore  of course  to understand any qualification of
them 

  5  concrete terms may be subdivided according to the number of things
they denote and the way in which they denote them  a term may denote one
thing or many  if one  it is called singular  if many  it may do so
distributively  and then it is general  or  as taken all together  and
then it is collective  one  then  any one of many  many in one 

among singular terms  each denoting a single thing  the most obvious are
proper names  such as gibraltar or george washington  which are merely
marks of individual things or persons  and may form no part of the
common language of a country  they are thus distinguished from other
singular terms  which consist of common words so combined as to restrict
their denotation to some individual  such as   the strongest man on
earth  

proper terms are often said to be arbitrary signs  because their use
does not depend upon any reason that may be given for them  gibraltar
had a meaning among the moors when originally conferred  but no one now
knows what it was  unless he happens to have learned it  yet the name
serves its purpose as well as if it were  rooke s nest   every newton
or newport year by year grows old  but to alter the name would cause
only confusion  if such names were given by mere caprice it would make
no difference  and they could not be more cumbrous  ugly  or absurd than
many of those that are given  for reasons  

the remaining kinds of singular terms are drawn from the common
resources of the language  thus the pronouns  he    she    it   are
singular terms  whose present denotation is determined by the occasion
and context of discourse  so with demonstrative phrases   the man  
 that horse   descriptive names may be more complex  as  the wisest man
of gotham   which is limited to some individual by the superlative
suffix  or  the german emperor   which is limited by the definite
article  the general term  german emperor  being thereby restricted
either to the reigning monarch or to the one we happen to be discussing 
instead of the definite  the indefinite article may be used to make
general terms singular  as  a german emperor was crowned at versailles 
  individua vaga   

abstract terms are ostensively singular   whiteness   e g   is one
quality  but their full meaning is general   whiteness  stands for all
white things  so far as white  abstract terms  in fact  are only
formally singular 

general terms are words  or combinations of words  used to denote any
one of many things that resemble one another in certain respects 
 george iii   is a singular term denoting one man  but  king  is a
general term denoting him and all other men of the same rank  whilst the
compound  crowned head  is still more general  denoting kings and also
emperors  it is the nature of a general term  then  to be used in the
same sense of whatever it denotes  and its most characteristic form is
the class name  whether of objects  such as  king    sheep    ghost   or
of events  such as  accession    purchase    manifestation   things and
events are known by their qualities and relations  and every such
aspect  being a point of resemblance to some other things  becomes a
ground of generalisation  and therefore a ground for the need and use of
general terms  hence general terms are far the most important sort of
terms in logic  since in them general propositions are expressed and 
moreover  with rare exceptions   all predicates are general  for 
besides these typical class names  attributive words are general terms 
such as  royal    ruling    woolly    bleating    impalpable  
 vanishing  

infinitives may also be used as general terms  as   to err is human   
but for logical purposes they may have to be translated into equivalent
substantive forms  as  foolish actions are characteristic of mankind  
abstract terms  too  are  as i observed  equivalent to general terms 
 folly  is abstract for  foolish actions     honesty is the best
policy   means  people who are honest may hope to find their account in
being so   that is  in the effects of their honest actions  provided
they are wise in other ways  and no misfortunes attend them  the
abstract form is often much the more succinct and forcible  but for
logical treatment it needs to be interpreted in the general form 

by antonomasia proper names may become general terms  as if we say   a
johnson  would not have written such a book   i e   any man of his
genius for elaborate eloquence 

a collective term denotes a multitude of similar things considered as
forming one whole  as  regiment    flock    nation   not distributively 
that is  not the similar things severally  to denote them we must say
 soldiers of the regiment    sheep of the flock   and so on  if in a
multitude of things there is no resemblance  except the fact of being
considered as parts of one whole  as  the world   or  the town of
nottingham   meaning its streets and houses  open spaces  people  and
civic organisation   the term denoting them as a whole is singular  but
 the world  or  town of nottingham   meaning the inhabitants only  is
collective 

in their strictly collective use  all such expressions are equivalent to
singular terms  but many of them may also be used as general terms  as
when we speak of  so many regiments of the line   or discuss the
 plurality of worlds   and in this general use they denote any of a
multitude of things of the same kind  regiments  or habitable worlds 

names of substances  such as  gold    air    water   may be employed as
singular  collective  or general terms  though  perhaps  as singular
terms only figuratively  as when we say  gold is king   if we say with
thales    water is the source of all things     water  seems to be used
collectively  but substantive names are frequently used as general
terms  for example   gold is heavy  means  in comparison with other
things   such as water  and  plainly  it does not mean that the
aggregate of gold is heavier than the aggregate of water  but only that
its specific gravity is greater  that is  bulk for bulk  any piece of
gold is heavier than water 

finally  any class name may be used collectively if we wish to assert
something of the things denoted by it  not distributively but
altogether  as that  sheep are more numerous than wolves  




chapter iv

the connotation of terms


  1  terms are next to be classified according to their
connotation  that is  according to what they imply as characteristic of
the things denoted  we have seen that general names are used to denote
many things in the same sense  because the things denoted resemble one
another in certain ways  it is this resemblance in certain points that
leads us to class the things together and call them by the same name 
and therefore the points of resemblance constitute the sense or meaning
of the name  or its connotation  and limit its applicability to such
things as have these characteristic qualities   sheep  for example  is
used in the same sense  to denote any of a multitude of animals that
resemble one another  their size  shape  woolly coats  cloven hoofs 
innocent ways and edibility are well known  when we apply to anything
the term  sheep   we imply that it has these qualities   sheep  
denoting the animal  connotes its possessing these characteristics  and 
of course  it cannot  without a figure of speech or a blunder  be used
to denote anything that does not possess all these qualities  it is by a
figure of speech that the term  sheep  is applied to some men  and to
apply it to goats would be a blunder 

most people are very imperfectly aware of the connotation of the words
they use  and are guided in using them merely by the custom of the
language  a man who employs a word quite correctly may be sadly posed by
a request to explain or define it  moreover  so far as we are aware of
the connotation of terms  the number and the kind of attributes we
think of  in any given case  vary with the depth of our interest  and
with the nature of our interest in the things denoted   sheep  has one
meaning to a touring townsman  a much fuller one to a farmer  and yet a
different one to a zoologist  but this does not prevent them agreeing in
the use of the word  as long as the qualities they severally include in
its meaning are not incompatible 

all general names  and therefore not only class names  like  sheep   but
all attributives  have some connotation   woolly  denotes anything that
bears wool  and connotes the fact of bearing wool   innocent  denotes
anything that habitually and by its disposition does no harm  or has not
been guilty of a particular offence   and connotes a harmless character
 or freedom from particular guilt    edible  denotes whatever can be
eaten with good results  and connotes its suitability for mastication 
deglutition  digestion  and assimilation 

  2  but whether all terms must connote as well as denote something  has
been much debated  proper names  according to what seems the better
opinion  are  in their ordinary use  not connotative  to say that they
have no meaning may seem violent  if any one is called john doe  this
name  no doubt  means a great deal to his friends and neighbours 
reminding them of his stature and physiognomy  his air and gait  his wit
and wisdom  some queer stories  and an indefinite number of other
things  but all this significance is local or accidental  it only exists
for those who know the individual or have heard him described  whereas a
general name gives information about any thing or person it denotes to
everybody who understands the language  without any particular knowledge
of the individual 

we must distinguish  in fact  between the peculiar associations of the
proper name and the commonly recognised meaning of the general name 
this is why proper names are not in the dictionary  such a name as
london  to be sure  or napoleon buonaparte  has a significance not
merely local  still  it is accidental  these names are borne by other
places and persons than those that have rendered them famous  there are
londons in various latitudes  and  no doubt  many napoleon buonapartes
in louisiana  and each name has in its several denotations an altogether
different suggestiveness  for its suggestiveness is in each application
determined by the peculiarities of the place or person denoted  it is
not given to the different places  or to the different persons  because
they have certain characteristics in common 

however  the scientific grounds of the doctrine that proper names are
non connotative  are these  the peculiarities that distinguish an
individual person or thing are admitted to be infinite  and anything
less than a complete enumeration of these peculiarities may fail to
distinguish and identify the individual  for  short of a complete
enumeration of them  the description may be satisfied by two or more
individuals  and in that case the term denoting them  if limited by such
a description  is not a proper but a general name  since it is
applicable to two or more in the same sense  the existence of other
individuals to whom it applies may be highly improbable  but  if it be
logically possible  that is enough  on the other hand  the enumeration
of infinite peculiarities is certainly impossible  therefore proper
names have no assignable connotation  the only escape from this
reasoning lies in falling back upon time and place  the principles of
individuation  as constituting the connotation of proper names  two
things cannot be at the same time in the same place  hence  the man who
was at a certain spot on the bridge of lodi at a certain instant in a
certain year  suffices to identify napoleon buonaparte for that instant 
supposing no one else to have borne the name  then  is this its
connotation  no one has ever thought so  and  at any rate  time and
place are only extrinsic determinations  suitable indeed to events like
the battle of lodi  or to places themselves like london   whereas the
connotation of a general term  such as  sheep   consists of intrinsic
qualities  hence  then  the scholastic doctrine  that individuals have
no essence   see chap  xxii    9   and hamilton s dictum  that every
concept is inadequate  sic  to the individual   are justified 

general names  when used as proper names  lose their connotation  as
euxine or newfoundland 

singular terms  other than proper  have connotation  either in
themselves  like the singular pronouns  he    she    it   which are
general in their applicability  though singular in application  or 
derivatively  from the general names that combine to form them  as in
 the first emperor of the french  or the  capital of the british
empire  

  3  whether abstract terms have any connotation is another disputed
question  we have seen that they denote a quality or qualities of
something  and that is precisely what general terms connote   honesty 
denotes a quality of some men   honest  connotes the same quality 
whilst denoting the men who have it 

the denotation of abstract terms thus seems to exhaust their force or
meaning  it has been proposed  however  to regard them as connoting the
qualities they directly stand for  and not denoting anything  but surely
this is too violent  to denote something is the same as to be the name
of something  whether real or unreal   which every term must be  it is a
better proposal to regard their denotation and connotation as
coinciding  though open to the objection that  connote  means  to mark
along with  something else  and this plan leaves nothing else  mill
thought that abstract terms are connotative when  besides denoting a
quality  they suggest a quality of that quality  as  fault  implies
 hurtfulness    but against this it may be urged that one quality cannot
bear another  since every qualification of a quality constitutes a
distinct quality in the total   milk whiteness  is distinct from
 whiteness    cf   chap  iii    4   after all  if it is the most
consistent plan  why not say that abstract  like proper  terms have no
connotation 

but if abstract terms must be made to connote something  should it not
be those things  indefinitely suggested  to which the qualities belong 
thus  whiteness  may be considered to connote either snow or vapour  or
any white thing  apart from one or other of which the quality has no
existence  whose existence therefore it implies  by this course the
denotation and connotation of abstract and of general names would be
exactly reversed  whilst the denotation of a general name is limited by
the qualities connoted  the connotation of an abstract name includes all
the things in which its denotation is realised  but the whole difficulty
may be avoided by making it a rule to translate  for logical purposes 
all abstract into the corresponding general terms 

  4  if we ask how the connotation of a term is to be known  the answer
depends upon how it is used  if used scientifically  its connotation is
determined by  and is the same as  its definition  and the definition is
determined by examining the things to be denoted  as we shall see in
chap  xxii  if the same word is used as a term in different sciences  as
 property  in law and in logic  it will be differently defined by them 
and will have  in each use  a correspondingly different connotation  but
terms used in popular discourse should  as far as possible  have their
connotations determined by classical usage  i e   by the sense in
which they are used by writers and speakers who are acknowledged masters
of the language  such as dryden and burke  in this case the classical
connotation determines the definition  so that to define terms thus used
is nothing else than to analyse their accepted meanings 

it must not  however  be supposed that in popular use the connotation
of any word is invariable  logicians have attempted to classify
terms into univocal  having only one meaning  and √¶quivocal  or
ambiguous   and no doubt some words  like  civil    natural    proud  
 liberal    humorous   are more manifestly liable to ambiguous use than
some others  but in truth all general terms are popularly and
classically used in somewhat different senses 

figurative or tropical language chiefly consists in the transfer of
words to new senses  as by metaphor or metonymy  in the course of years 
too  words change their meanings  and before the time of dryden our
whole vocabulary was much more fluid and adaptable than it has since
become  such authors as bacon  milton  and sir thomas browne often used
words derived from the latin in some sense they originally had in latin 
though in english they had acquired another meaning  spenser and
shakespeare  besides this practice  sometimes use words in a way that
can only be justified by their choosing to have it so  whilst their
contemporaries  beaumont and fletcher  write the perfect modern
language  as dryden observed  lapse of time  however  is not the chief
cause of variation in the sense of words  the matters which terms are
used to denote are often so complicated or so refined in the assemblage 
interfusion  or gradation of their qualities  that terms do not exist in
sufficient abundance and discriminativeness to denote the things and  at
the same time  to convey by connotation a determinate sense of their
agreements and differences  in discussing politics  religion  ethics 
√¶sthetics  this imperfection of language is continually felt  and the
only escape from it  short of coining new words  is to use such words as
we have  now in one sense  now in another somewhat different  and to
trust to the context  or to the resources of the literary art  in order
to convey the true meaning  against this evil the having been born since
dryden is no protection  it behoves us  then  to remember that terms are
not classifiable into univocal and √¶quivocal  but that all terms are
susceptible of being used √¶quivocally  and that honesty and lucidity
require us to try  as well as we can  to use each term univocally in the
same context 

the context of any proposition always proceeds upon some assumption or
understanding as to the scope of the discussion  which controls the
interpretation of every statement and of every word  this was called by
de morgan the  universe of discourse   an older name for it  revived by
dr  venn  and surely a better one  is  suppositio   if we are talking of
children  and  play  is mentioned  the  suppositio  limits the
suggestiveness of the word in one way  whilst if monaco is the subject
of conversation  the same word  play   under the influence of a
different  suppositio   excites altogether different ideas  hence to
ignore the  suppositio  is a great source of fallacies of equivocation 
 man  is generally defined as a kind of animal  but  animal  is often
used as opposed to and excluding man   liberal  has one meaning under
the  suppositio  of politics  another with regard to culture  and still
another as to the disposal of one s private means  clearly  therefore 
the connotation of general terms is relative to the  suppositio   or
 universe of discourse  

  5  relative and absolute terms   some words go in couples or groups 
like  up down    former latter    father mother children  
 hunter prey    cause effect   etc  these are called relative terms 
and their nature  as explained by mill  is that the connotations of the
members of such a pair or group are derived from the same set of facts
 the  fundamentum relationis    there cannot be an  up  without a
 down   a  father  without a  mother  and  child   there cannot be a
 hunter  without something hunted  nor  prey  without a pursuer  what
makes a man a  hunter  is his activities in pursuit  and what turns a
chamois into  prey  is its interest in these activities  the meaning of
both terms  therefore  is derived from the same set of facts  neither
term can be explained without explaining the other  because the relation
between them is connoted by both  and neither can with propriety be used
without reference to the other  or to some equivalent  as  game  for
 prey  

in contrast with such relative terms  others have been called absolute
or non relative  whilst  hunter  and  prey  are relative   man  and
 chamois  have been considered absolute  as we may use them without
thinking of any special connection between their meanings  however  if
we believe in the unity of nature and in the relativity of knowledge
 that is  that all knowledge depends upon comparison  or a perception of
the resemblances and differences of things   it follows that nothing can
be completely understood except through its agreements or contrasts with
everything else  and that all terms derive their connotation from the
same set of facts  namely  from general experience  thus both man and
chamois are animals  this fact is an important part of the meaning of
both terms  and to that extent they are relative terms   five yards  and
 five minutes  are very different notions  yet they are profoundly
related  for their very difference helps to make both notions distinct 
and their intimate connection is shown in this  that five yards are
traversed in a certain time  and that five minutes are measured by the
motion of an index over some fraction of a yard upon the dial 

the distinction  then  between relative and non relative terms must
rest  not upon a fundamental difference between them  since  in fact 
all words are relative   but upon the way in which words are used  we
have seen that some words  such as  up down    cause effect   can only
be used relatively  and these may  for distinction  be called
correlatives  but other words  whose meanings are only partially
interdependent  may often be used without attending to their relativity 
and may then be considered as absolute  we cannot say  the hunter
returned empty handed   without implying that  the prey escaped   but we
may say  the man went supperless to bed   without implying that  the
chamois rejoiced upon the mountain   such words as  man  and  chamois 
may  then  in their use  be  as to one another  non relative 

to illustrate further the relativity of terms  we may mention some of
the chief classes of them 

numerical order  1st  2nd  3rd  etc   1st implies 2nd  and 2nd 1st 
and 3rd implies 1st and 2nd  but these do not imply 3rd  and so on 

order in time or place  before after  early punctual late 
right middle left  north south  etc 

as to extent  volume  and degree  greater equal less 
large medium small  whole and part 

genus and species are a peculiar case of whole and part   cf   chaps 
xxi  ii  iii    sometimes a term connotes all the attributes that
another does  and more besides  which  as distinguishing it  are called
differential  thus  man  connotes all that  animal  does  and also  as
 differenti√¶   the erect gait  articulate speech  and other attributes 
in such a case as this  where there are well marked classes  the term
whose connotation is included in the others  is called a genus of that
species  we have a genus  triangle  and a species  isosceles  marked off
from all other triangles by the differential quality of having two equal
sides  again  genus  book  species  quarto  difference  having each
sheet folded into four leaves 

there are other cases where these expressions  genus  and  species 
cannot be so applied without a departure from usage  as  e g   if we
call snow a species of the genus  white   for  white  is not a
recognised class  the connotation of white  i e   whiteness  is 
however  part of the connotation of snow  just as the qualities of
 animal  are amongst those of  man   and for logical purposes it is
desirable to use  genus and species  to express that relativity of
terms which consists in the connotation of one being part of the
connotation of the other 

two or more terms whose connotations severally include that of another
term  whilst at the same time exceeding it  are  in relation to that
other term  called co ordinate  thus in relation to  white   snow and
silver are co ordinate  in relation to colour  yellow and red and blue
are co ordinate  and when all the terms thus related stand for
recognised natural classes  the co ordinate terms are called co ordinate
species  thus man and chamois are  in logic  co ordinate species of the
genus animal 

  6  from such examples of terms whose connotations are related as whole
and part  it is easy to see the general truth of the doctrine that as
connotation decreases  denotation increases  for  animal   with less
connotation than man or chamois  denotes many more objects   white  
with less connotation than snow or silver  denotes many more things  it
is not  however  certain that this doctrine is always true in the
concrete  since there may be a term connoting two or more qualities  all
of which qualities are peculiar to all the things it denotes  and  if
so  by subtracting one of the qualities from its connotation  we should
not increase its denotation  if  man   for example  has among mammals
the two peculiar attributes of erect gait and articulate speech  then 
by omitting  articulate speech  from the connotation of man  we could
not apply the name to any more of the existing mammalia than we can at
present  still we might have been able to do so  there might have been
an erect inarticulate ape  and perhaps there once was one  and  if so 
to omit  articulate  from the connotation of man would make the term
 man  denote that animal  supposing that there was no other difference
to exclude it   hence  potentially  an increase of the connotation of
any term implies a decrease of its denotation  and  on the other hand 
we can only increase the denotation of a term  or apply it to more
objects  by decreasing its connotation  for  if the new things denoted
by the term had already possessed its whole connotation  they must
already have been denoted by it  however  we may increase the  known 
denotation without decreasing the connotation  if we can discover the
full connotation in things not formerly supposed to have it  as when
dolphins were discovered to be mammals  or if we can impose the
requisite qualities upon new individuals  as when by annexing some
millions of africans we extend the denotation of  british subject 
without altering its connotation 

many of the things noticed in this chapter  especially in this section
and the preceding  will be discussed at greater length in the chapters
on classification and definition 

  7  contradictory relative terms   every term has  or may have  another
corresponding with it in such a way that  whatever differential
qualities    5  it connotes  this other connotes merely their absence 
so that one or the other is always formally predicable of any subject 
but both these terms are never predicable of the same subject in the
same relation  such pairs of terms are called contradictories  whatever
subject we take  it is either visible or invisible  but not both  either
human or non human  but not both 

this at least is true formally  though in practice we should think
ourselves trifled with if any one told us that  a mountain is either
human or non human  but not both   it is symbolic terms  such as x and
x  that are properly said to be contradictories in relation to any
subject whatever  s or m  for  as we have seen  the ordinary use of
terms is limited by some  suppositio   and this is true of
contradictories   human  and  non human  may refer to zoological
classification  or to the scope of physical  mental  or moral powers  as
if we ask whether to flourish a dumbbell of a ton weight  or to know the
future by intuition  or impeccability  be human or non human  similarly 
 visible  and  invisible  refer either to the power of emitting or
reflecting light  so that the words have no hold upon a sound or a
scent  or else to power of vision and such qualifications as  with the
naked eye  or  with a microscope  

again  the above definition of contradictories tells us that they cannot
be predicated of the same subject  in the same relation   that is  at
the same time or place  or under the same conditions  the lamp is
visible to me now  but will be invisible if i turn it out  one side of
it is now visible  but the other is not  therefore without this
restriction   in the same relation   few or no terms would be
contradictory 

if a man is called wise  it may mean  on the whole  or  in a certain
action   and clearly a man may for once be wise  or act wisely  who  on
the whole  is not wise  so that here again  by this ambiguity  terms
that seem contradictory are predicable of the same subject  but not  in
the same relation   in order to avoid the ambiguity  however  we have
only to construct the term so as to express the relation  as  wise on
the whole   and this immediately generates the contradictory  not wise
on the whole   similarly  at one age a man may have black hair  at
another not black hair  but the difficulty is practically removable by
stating the age referred to 

still  this case easily leads us to a real difficulty in the use of
contradictory terms  a difficulty arising from the continuous change or
 flux  of natural phenomena  if things are continually changing  it may
be urged that contradictory terms are always applicable to the same
subject  at least as fast as we can utter them  for if we have just said
that a man s hair is black  since  like everything else  his hair is
changing  it must now be not black  though  to be sure  it may still
seem black  the difficulty  such as it is  lies in this  that the human
mind and its instrument language are not equal to the subtlety of
nature  all things flow  but the terms of human discourse assume a
certain fixity of things  everything at every moment changes  but for
the most part we can neither perceive this change nor express it in
ordinary language 

this paradox  however  may  i suppose  be easily over stated  the change
that continually agitates nature consists in the movements of masses or
molecules  and such movements of things are compatible with a
considerable persistence of their qualities  not only are the molecular
changes always going on in a piece of gold compatible with its remaining
yellow  but its persistent yellowness depends on the continuance of some
of those changes  similarly  a man s hair may remain black for some
years  though  no doubt  at a certain age its colour may begin to be
problematical  and the applicability to it of  black  or  not black  may
become a matter of genuine anxiety  whilst being on our guard  then 
against fallacies of contradiction arising from the imperfect
correspondence of fact with thought and language  we shall often have to
put up with it  candour and humility having been satisfied by the above
acknowledgment of the subtlety of nature  we may henceforward proceed
upon the postulate  that it is possible to use contradictory terms such
as cannot both be predicated of the same subject in the same relation 
though one of them may be  that  for example  it may be truly said of a
man for some years that his hair is black  and  if so  that during those
years to call it not black is false or extremely misleading 

the most opposed terms of the literary vocabulary  however  such as
 wise foolish    old young    sweet bitter   are rarely true
contradictories  wise and foolish  indeed  cannot be predicated of the
same man in the same relation  but there are many middling men  of whom
neither can be predicated on the whole  for the comparison of
quantities  again  we have three correlative terms 
 greater  equal  less   and none of these is the contradictory of either
of the others  in fact  the contradictory of any term is one that
denotes the sum of its co ordinates    6   and to obtain a
contradictory  the surest way is to coin one by prefixing to the given
term the particle  not  or  sometimes   non   as  wise  not wise  
 human  non human    greater  not greater  

the separate word  not  is surer to constitute a contradictory than the
usual prefixes of negation   un   or  in    or even  non   since
compounds of these are generally warped by common use from a purely
negative meaning  thus   nonconformist  does not denote everybody who
fails to conform   unwise  is not equivalent to  not wise   but means
 rather foolish   a very foolish action is not wise  but can only be
called unwise by meiosis or irony  still  negatives formed by  in  or
 un  or  non  are sometimes really contradictory of their positives  as
 visible  invisible    equal  unequal  

  8  the distinction between positive and negative terms is not of much
value in logic  what importance would else attach to it being absorbed
by the more definite distinction of contradictories  for contradictories
are positive and negative in essence and  when least ambiguously stated 
also in form  and  on the other hand  as we have seen  when positive and
negative terms are not contradictory  they are misleading  as with
 wise unwise   so with many others  such as  happy unhappy   which are
not contradictories  since a man may be neither happy nor unhappy  but
indifferent  or  again  so miserable that he can only be called unhappy
by a figure of speech  in fact  in the common vocabulary a formal
negative often has a limited positive sense  and this is the case with
unhappy  signifying the state of feeling in the milder shades of
purgatory 

when a negative term is fully contradictory of its positive it is said
to be infinite  because it denotes an unascertained multitude of things 
a multitude only limited by the positive term and the  suppositio   thus
 not wise  denotes all except the wise  within the  suppositio  of
 intelligent beings   formally  disregarding any  suppositio    such a
negative term stands for all possible terms except its positive  x
denotes everything but x  and  not wise  may be taken to include stones 
triangles and hippogriffs  and even in this sense  a negative term has
some positive meaning  though a very indefinite one  not a specific
positive force like  unwise  or  unhappy   it denotes any and everything
that has not the attributes connoted by the corresponding positive term 

privative terms connote the absence of a quality that normally belongs
to the kind of thing denoted  as  blind  or  deaf   we may predicate
 blind  or  deaf  of a man  dog or cow that happens not to be able to
see or hear  because the powers of seeing and hearing generally belong
to those species  but of a stone or idol these terms can only be used
figuratively  indeed  since the contradictory of a privative carries
with it the privative limitation  a stone is strictly  not blind   that
is  it is  not something that normally having sight wants it  

contrary terms are those that  within a certain genus or  suppositio  
severally connote differential qualities that are  in fact  mutually
incompatible in the same relation to the same thing  and therefore
cannot be predicated of the same subject in the same relation  and  so
far  they resemble contradictory terms  but they differ from
contradictory terms in this  that the differential quality connoted by
each of them is definitely positive  no contrary term is infinite  but
is limited to part of the  suppositio  excluded by the others  so that 
possibly  neither of two contraries is truly predicable of a given
subject  thus  blue  and  red  are contraries  for they cannot both be
predicated of the same thing in the same relation  but are not
contradictories  since  in a given case  neither may be predicable  if a
flower is blue in a certain part  it cannot in the same part be red  but
it may be neither blue nor red  but yellow  though it is certainly
either blue or not blue  all co ordinate terms are formal contraries 
but if  in fact  a series of co ordinates comprises only two  as
male female   they are empirical contradictories  since each includes
all that area of the  suppositio  which the other excludes 

the extremes of a series of co ordinate terms are opposites  as  in a
list of colours  white and black  the most strongly contrasted  are said
to be opposites  or as among moods of feeling  rapture and misery are
opposites  but this distinction is of slight logical importance 
imperfect positive and negative couples  like  happy and unhappy   which
 as we have seen  are not contradictories  are often called opposites 

the members of any series of contraries are all included by any one of
them and its contradictory  as all colours come under  red  and
 not red   all moods of feeling under  happy  and  not happy  




chapter v

the classification of propositions


  1  logicians classify propositions according to quantity  quality 
relation and modality 

as to quantity  propositions are either universal or particular  that is
to say  the predicate is affirmed or denied either of the whole subject
or of a part of it  of  all  or of  some s  

     all s is p   that is   p  is predicated of  all s   
     some s is p   that is   p  is predicated of  some s   

an universal proposition may have for its subject a singular term  a
collective  a general term distributed  or an abstract term 

 1  a proposition having a singular term for its subject  as  the queen
has gone to france   is called a singular proposition  and some
logicians regard this as a third species of proposition with respect to
quantity  distinct from the universal and particular  but that is
needless 

 2  a collective term may be the subject  as  the black watch is ordered
to india   in this case  as well as in singular propositions  a
predication is made concerning the whole subject as a whole 

 3  the subject may be a general term taken in its full denotation  as
 all apes are sagacious   and in this case a predication is made
concerning the whole subject distributively  that is  of each and
everything the subject stands for 

 4  propositions whose subjects are abstract terms  though they may
seem to be formally singular  are really as to their meaning
distributive universals  since whatever is true of a quality is true of
whatever thing has that quality so far as that quality is concerned 
 truth will prevail  means that  all true propositions are accepted at
last   by sheer force of being true  in spite of interests  prejudices 
ignorance and indifference   to bear this in mind may make one cautious
in the use of abstract terms 

in the above paragraphs a distinction is implied between singular and
distributive universals  but  technically  every term  whether subject
or predicate  when taken in its full denotation  or universally   is
said to be  distributed   although this word  in its ordinary sense 
would be directly applicable only to general terms  in the above
examples  then   queen    black watch    apes   and  truth  are all
distributed terms  indeed  a simple definition of the universal
proposition is  one whose subject is distributed  

a particular proposition is one that has a general term for its subject 
whilst its predicate is not affirmed or denied of everything the subject
denotes  in other words  it is one whose subject is not distributed  as
 some lions inhabit africa  

in ordinary discourse it is not always explicitly stated whether
predication is universal or particular  it would be very natural to say
 lions inhabit africa   leaving it  as far as the words go  uncertain
whether we mean  all  or  some  lions  propositions whose quantity is
thus left indefinite are technically called  preindesignate   their
quantity not being stated or designated by any introductory expression 
whilst propositions whose quantity is expressed  as  all
foundling hospitals have a high death rate   or  some wine is made from
grapes   are said to be  predesignate   now  the rule is that
preindesignate propositions are  for logical purposes  to be treated as
particular  since it is an obvious precaution of the science of proof 
in any practical application   not to go beyond the evidence   still 
the rule may be relaxed if the universal quantity of a preindesignate
proposition is well known or admitted  as in  planets shine with
reflected light   understood of the planets of our solar system at the
present time  again  such a proposition as  man is the paragon of
animals  is not a preindesignate  but an abstract proposition  the
subject being elliptical for  man according to his proper nature   and
the translation of it into a predesignate proposition is not  all men
are paragons   nor can  some men  be sufficient  since an abstract can
only be adequately rendered by a distributed term  but we must say   all
men who approach the ideal   universal real propositions  true without
qualification  are very scarce  and we often substitute for them
 general  propositions  saying perhaps   generally  though not
universally  s is p   such general propositions are  in strictness 
particular  and the logical rules concerning universals cannot be
applied to them without careful scrutiny of the facts 

the marks or predesignations of quantity commonly used in logic are  for
universals   all    any    every    whatever   in the negative  no  or
 no one   see next     for particulars   some  

now  some   technically used  does not mean  some only   but  some at
least   it may be one  or more  or all   if it meant   some only   
every particular proposition would be an exclusive exponible  chap  ii 
  3   since  only some men are wise  implies that  some men are not
wise   besides  it may often happen in an investigation that all the
instances we have observed come under a certain rule  though we do not
yet feel justified in regarding the rule as universal  and this
situation is exactly met by the expression  some    it may be all   

the words  many    most    few  are generally interpreted to mean
 some   but as  most  signifies that exceptions are known  and  few 
that the exceptions are the more numerous  propositions thus
predesignate are in fact exponibles  mounting to  some are  and  some
are not   if to work with both forms be too cumbrous  so that we must
choose one  apparently  few are  should be treated as  some are not  
the scientific course to adopt with propositions predesignate by  most 
or  few   is to collect statistics and determine the percentage  thus 
 few men are wise   say 2 per cent 

the quantity of a proposition  then  is usually determined entirely by
the quantity of the subject  whether  all  or  some   still  the
quantity of the predicate is often an important consideration  and
though in ordinary usage the predicate is seldom predesignate  logicians
agree that in every negative proposition  see   2  the predicate is
 distributed   that is to say  is denied altogether of the subject  and
that this is involved in the form of denial  to say  some men are not
brave   is to declare that the quality for which men may be called brave
is not found in any of the  some men  referred to  and to say  no men
are proof against flattery   cuts off the being  proof against flattery 
entirely from the list of human attributes  on the other hand  every
affirmative proposition is regarded as having an undistributed
predicate  that is to say  its predicate is not affirmed exclusively of
the subject   some men are wise  does not mean that  wise  cannot be
predicated of any other beings  it is equivalent to  some men are wise 
  whoever else may be    and  all elephants are sagacious  does not
limit sagacity to elephants  regarding  sagacious  as possibly denoting
many animals of many species that exhibit the quality  this proposition
is equivalent to   all elephants are  some  sagacious animals    the
affirmative predication of a quality does not imply exclusive possession
of it as denial implies its complete absence  and  therefore  to regard
the predicate of an affirmative proposition as distributed would be to
go beyond the evidence and to take for granted what had never been
alleged 

some logicians  seeing that the quantity of predicates  though not
distinctly expressed  is recognised  and holding that it is the part of
logic  to make explicit in language whatever is implicit in thought  
have proposed to exhibit the quantity of predicates by predesignation 
thus   some men are  some  wise  beings     some men are not  any  brave
 beings    etc  this is called the quantification of the predicate 
and leads to some modifications of deductive logic which will be
referred to hereafter   see   3  chap  vii    4  and chap  viii    3  

  2  as to quality  propositions are either affirmative or negative  an
affirmative proposition is  formally  one whose copula is affirmative
 or  has no negative sign   as  s  is  p  all men  are  partial to
themselves   a negative proposition is one whose copula is negative  or 
has a negative sign   as  s  is not  p  some men  are not  proof against
flattery   when  indeed  a negative proposition is of universal
quantity  it is stated thus   no s is p  no men are proof against
flattery   but  in this case  the detachment of the negative sign from
the copula and its association with the subject is merely an accident of
our idiom  the proposition is the same as  all men  are not  proof
against flattery   it must be distinguished  therefore  from such an
expression as  not every man is proof against flattery   for here the
negative sign really restricts the subject  so that the meaning
is   some men at most   it may be  none  are proof against flattery  
and thus the proposition is particular  and is rendered   some men  are
not  proof against flattery  

when the negative sign is associated with the predicate  so as to make
this an infinite term  chap  iv    8   the proposition is called an
infinite proposition  as  s is not p   or  p   all men are  incapable of
resisting flattery   or  are  not proof against flattery  

infinite propositions  when the copula is affirmative  are formally 
themselves affirmative  although their force is chiefly negative  for 
as the last example shows  the difference between an infinite and a
negative proposition may depend upon a hyphen  it has been proposed 
indeed  with a view to superficial simplification  to turn all
negatives into infinites  and thus render all propositions affirmative
in quality  but although every proposition both affirms and denies
something according to the aspect in which you regard it  as  snow is
white  denies that it is any other colour  and  snow is not blue 
affirms that it is some other colour   yet there is a great difference
between the definite affirmation of a genuine affirmative and the vague
affirmation of a negative or infinite  so that materially an affirmative
infinite is the same as a negative 

generally mill s remark is true  that affirmation and denial stand for
distinctions of fact that cannot be got rid of by manipulation of words 
whether granite sinks in water  or not  whether the rook lives a hundred
years  or not  whether a man has a hundred dollars in his pocket  or
not  whether human bones have ever been found in pliocene strata  or
not  such alternatives require distinct forms of expression  at the same
time  it may be granted that many facts admit of being stated with
nearly equal propriety in either quality  as  no man is proof against
flattery   or  all men are open to flattery  

but whatever advantage there is in occasionally changing the quality of
a proposition may be gained by the process of obversion  chap  vii   
5   whilst to use only one quality would impair the elasticity of
logical expression  it is a postulate of logic that the negative sign
may be transferred from the copula to the predicate  or from the
predicate to the copula  without altering the sense of a proposition 
and this is justified by the experience that not to have an attribute
and to be without it are the same thing 

  3  a  i  e  o   combining the two kinds of quantity  universal and
particular  with the two kinds of quality  affirmative and negative  we
get four simple types of proposition  which it is usual to symbolise by
the letters a  i  e  o   thus 

a    universal affirmative      all s is p 
i    particular affirmative     some s is p 
e    universal negative         no s is p 
o    particular negative        some s is not p 

as an aid to the remembering of these symbols we may observe that a  and
i  are the first two vowels in  affirmo  and that e  and o  are the
vowels in  nego  

it must be acknowledged that these four kinds of proposition recognised
by formal logic constitute a very meagre selection from the list of
propositions actually used in judgment and reasoning 

those logicians who explicitly quantify the predicate obtain  in all 
eight forms of proposition according to quantity and quality 

u    toto total affirmative         all x is all y 
a    toto partial affirmative       all x is some y 
y    parti total affirmative        some x is all y 
i    parti partial affirmative      some x is some y 
e    toto total negative            no x is any y 
Œ∑    toto partial negative          no x is some y 
o    parti total negative           some x is not any y 
œâ    parti partial negative         some x is not some y 

here a  i  e  o  correspond with those similarly symbolised in the usual
list  merely designating in the predicates the quantity which was
formerly treated as implicit 

  4  as to relation  propositions are either categorical or conditional 
a categorical proposition is one in which the predicate is directly
affirmed or denied of the subject without any limitation of time  place 
or circumstance  extraneous to the subject  as  all men in england are
secure of justice   in which proposition  though there is a limitation
of place   in england    it is included in the subject  of this kind are
nearly all the examples that have yet been given  according to the form
 s is p  

a conditional proposition is so called because the predication is made
under some limitation or condition not included in the subject  as  if a
man live in england  he is secure of justice   here the limitation
 living in england  is put into a conditional sentence extraneous to the
subject   he   representing any man 

conditional propositions  again  are of two kinds  hypothetical and
disjunctive  hypothetical propositions are those that are limited by an
explicit conditional sentence  as above  or thus   if joe smith was a
prophet  his followers have been unjustly persecuted   or in symbols
thus 

    if a is  b is 
    if a is b  a is c 
    if a is b  c is d 

disjunctive propositions are those in which the condition under which
predication is made is not explicit but only implied under the disguise
of an alternative proposition  as  joe smith was either a prophet or an
impostor   here there is no direct predication concerning joe smith  but
only a predication of one of the alternatives conditionally on the other
being denied  as   if joe smith was not a prophet he was an impostor  
or   if he was not an impostor  he was a prophet   symbolically 
disjunctives may be represented thus 

    a is either b or c 
    either a is b or c is d 

formally  every conditional may be expressed as a categorical  for our
last example shows how a disjunctive may be reduced to two hypotheticals
 of which one is redundant  being the contrapositive of the other  see
chap  vii    10   and a hypothetical is reducible to a categorical thus 
 if the sky is clear  the night is cold  may be read   the case of the
sky being clear is a case of the night being cold   and this  though a
clumsy plan  is sometimes convenient  it would be better to say  the sky
being clear is a sign of the night being cold   or a condition of it 
for  as mill says  the essence of a hypothetical is to state that one
clause of it  the indicative  may be inferred from the other  the
conditional   similarly  we might write   proof of joe smith s not being
a prophet is a proof of his being an impostor  

this turning of conditionals into categoricals is called a change of
relation  and the process may be reversed   all the wise are virtuous 
may be written   if any man is wise he is virtuous   or  again   either
a man is not wise or he is virtuous   but the categorical form is
usually the simplest 

if  then  as substitutes for the corresponding conditionals 
categoricals are formally adequate  though sometimes inelegant  it may
be urged that logic has nothing to do with elegance  or that  at any
rate  the chief elegance of science is economy  and that therefore  for
scientific purposes  whatever we may write further about conditionals
must be an ugly excrescence  the scientific purpose of logic is to
assign the conditions of proof  can we  then  in the conditional form
prove anything that cannot be proved in the categorical  or does a
conditional require to be itself proved by any method not applicable to
the categorical  if not  why go on with the discussion of conditionals 
for all laws of nature  however stated  are essentially categorical   if
a straight line falls on another straight line  the adjacent angles are
together equal to two right angles    if a body is unsupported  it
falls    if population increases  rents tend to rise   here  if  means
 whenever  or  all cases in which   for to raise a doubt whether a
straight line is ever conceived to fall upon another  whether bodies are
ever unsupported  or population ever increases  is a superfluity of
scepticism  and plainly the hypothetical form has nothing to do with the
proof of such propositions  nor with inference from them 

still  the disjunctive form is necessary in setting out the relation of
contradictory terms  and in stating a division  chap  xxi    whether
formal   as a is b or not b   or material  as  cats are white  or black 
or tortoiseshell  or tabby    and in some cases the hypothetical form is
useful  one of these occurs where it is important to draw attention to
the condition  as something doubtful or especially requiring
examination   if there is a resisting medium in space  the earth will
fall into the sun  if the corn laws are to be re enacted  we had better
sell railways and buy land   here the hypothetical form draws attention
to the questions whether there is a resisting medium in space  whether
the corn laws are likely to be re enacted  but as to methods of
inference and proof  the hypothetical form has nothing to do with them 
the propositions predicate causation   a resisting medium in space is a
condition of the earth s falling into the sun  a corn law is a condition
of the rise of rents  and of the fall of railway profits  

a second case in which the hypothetical is a specially appropriate form
of statement occurs where a proposition relates to a particular matter
and to future time  as  if there be a storm to morrow  we shall miss our
picnic   such cases are of very slight logical interest  it is as
exercises in formal thinking that hypotheticals are of most value 
inasmuch as many people find them more difficult than categoricals to
manipulate 

in discussing conditional propositions  the conditional sentence of a
hypothetical  or the first alternative of a disjunctive  is called the
antecedent  the indicative sentence of a hypothetical  or the second
alternative of a disjunctive  is called the consequent 

hypotheticals  like categoricals  have been classed according to
quantity and quality  premising that the quantity of a hypothetical
depends on the quantity of its antecedent  which determines its
limitation   whilst its quality depends on the quality of its consequent
 which makes the predication   we may exhibit four forms 

    a   if a is b  c is d  
    i   sometimes when a is b  c is d  
    e   if a is b  c is not d  
    o   sometimes when a is b  c is not d  

but i  and o  are rarely used 

as for disjunctives  it is easy to distinguish the two quantities thus 

    a   either a is b  or c is d  
    i   sometimes either a is b or c is d  

but i  is rarely used  the distinction of quality  however  cannot be
made  there are no true negative forms  for if we write  

     neither is a b  nor c d  

there is here no alternative predication  but only an exponible
equivalent to  no a is b  and no c is d   and if we write  

     either a is not b  or c is not d  

this is affirmative as to the alternation  and is for all methods of
treatment equivalent to a 

logicians are divided in opinion as to the interpretation of the
conjunction  either  or   some holding that it means  not both   others
that it means  it may be both   grammatical usage  upon which the
question is sometimes argued  does not seem to be established in favour
of either view  if we say  a man so precise in his walk and conversation
is either a saint or a consummate hypocrite   or  again   one who is
happy in a solitary life is either more or less than man   we cannot in
such cases mean that the subject may be both  on the other hand  if it
be said that  the author of  a tale of a tub  is either a misanthrope or
a dyspeptic   the alternatives are not incompatible  or  again  given
that  x  is a lunatic  or a lover  or a poet   the three predicates have
much congruity 

it has been urged that in logic  language should be made as exact and
definite as possible  and that this requires the exclusive
interpretation  not both   but it seems a better argument  that logic
 1  should be able to express all meanings  and  2   as the science of
evidence  must not assume more than is given  to be on the safe side  it
must in doubtful cases assume the least  just as it generally assumes a
preindesignate term to be of particular quantity  and  therefore
 either  or  means  one  or the other  or both  

however  when both the alternative propositions have the same subject 
as  either a is b  or a is c   if the two predicates are contrary or
contradictory terms  as  saint  and  hypocrite   or  saint  and
 not saint    they cannot in their nature be predicable in the same way
of the same subject  and  therefore  in such a case  either  or  means
one or the other  but not both in the same relation  hence it seems
necessary to admit that the conjunction  either  or  may sometimes
require one interpretation  sometimes the other  and the rule is that it
implies the further possibility  or both   except when both alternatives
have the same subject whilst the predicates are contrary or
contradictory terms 

if  then  the disjunctive  a is either b or c    b  and  c  being
contraries  implies that both alternatives cannot be true  it can only
be adequately rendered in hypotheticals by the two forms   1   if a is
b  it is not c   and  2  if a is not b  it is c   but if the disjunctive
 a is either b or c    b  and  c  not being contraries  implies that
both may be true  it will be adequately translated into a hypothetical
by the single form   if a is not b  it is c   we cannot translate it
into   if a is b  it is not c   for  by our supposition  if   a is b  
is true  it does not follow that   a is c   must be false 

logicians are also divided in opinion as to the function of the
hypothetical form  some think it expresses doubt  for the consequent
depends on the antecedent  and the antecedent  introduced by  if   may
or may not be realised  as in  if the sky is clear  the night is cold  
whether the sky is  or is not  clear being supposed to be uncertain  and
we have seen that some hypothetical propositions seem designed to draw
attention to such uncertainty  as   if there is a resisting medium in
space   etc  but other logicians lay stress upon the connection of the
clauses as the important matter  the statement is  they say  that the
consequent may be inferred from the antecedent  some even declare that
it is given as a necessary inference  and on this ground sigwart rejects
particular hypotheticals  such as  sometimes when a is b  c is d   for
if it happens only sometimes the connexion cannot be necessary  indeed 
it cannot even be probably inferred without further grounds  but this is
also true whenever the antecedent and consequent are concerned with
different matter  for example   if the soul is simple  it is
indestructible   how do you know that  because  every simple substance
is indestructible   without this further ground there can be no
inference  the fact is that conditional forms often cover assertions
that are not true complex propositions but a sort of euthymemes  chap 
xi    2   arguments abbreviated and rhetorically disguised  thus   if
patience is a virtue there are painful virtues   an example from dr 
keynes  expanding this we have  

      patience is painful 
      patience is a virtue 
    ‚à¥ some virtue is painful 

and then we see the equivocation of the inference  for though patience
be painful  to learn   it is not painful  as a virtue  to the patient
man 

the hypothetical    if plato was not mistaken poets are dangerous
citizens    may be considered as an argument against the laureateship 
and may be expanded  informally  thus   all plato s opinions deserve
respect  one of them was that poets are bad citizens  therefore it
behoves us to be chary of encouraging poetry   or take this
disjunctive    either bacon wrote the works ascribed to shakespeare  or
there were two men of the highest genius in the same age and country   
this means that it is not likely there should be two such men  that we
are sure of bacon  and therefore ought to give him all the glory  now 
if it is the part of logic  to make explicit in language all that is
implicit in thought   or to put arguments into the form in which they
can best be examined  such propositions as the above ought to be
analysed in the way suggested  and confirmed or refuted according to
their real intention 

we may conclude that no single function can be assigned to all
hypothetical propositions  each must be treated according to its own
meaning in its own context 

  5  as to modality  propositions are divided into pure and modal  a
modal proposition is one in which the predicate is affirmed or denied 
not simply but  cum modo   with a qualification  and some logicians have
considered any adverb occurring in the predicate  or any sign of past or
future tense  enough to constitute a modal  as  petroleum is
 dangerously  inflammable    english  will be  the universal language  
but far the most important kind of modality  and the only one we need
consider  is that which is signified by some qualification of the
predicate as to the degree of certainty with which it is affirmed or
denied  thus   the bite of the cobra is  probably  mortal   is called a
contingent or problematic modal   water is  certainly  composed of
oxygen and hydrogen  is an assertory or certain modal   two straight
lines  cannot  enclose a space  is a necessary or apodeictic modal  the
opposite being inconceivable   propositions not thus qualified are
called pure 

modal propositions have had a long and eventful history  but they have
not been found tractable by the resources of ordinary logic  and are now
generally neglected by the authors of text books  no doubt such
propositions are the commonest in ordinary discourse  and in some rough
way we combine them and draw inferences from them  it is understood
that a combination of assertory or of apodeictic premises may warrant an
assertory or an apodeictic conclusion  but that if we combine either of
these with a problematic premise our conclusion becomes problematic 
whilst the combination of two problematic premises gives a conclusion
less certain than either  but if we ask  how much less certain   there
is no answer  that the modality of a conclusion follows the less certain
of the premises combined  is inadequate for scientific guidance  so
that  as deductive logic can get no farther than this  it has abandoned
the discussion of modals  to endeavour to determine the degree of
certainty attaching to a problematic judgment is not  however  beyond
the reach of induction  by analysing circumstantial evidence  or by
collecting statistics with regard to it  thus  instead of  the cobra s
bite is  probably  fatal   we might find that it is fatal 80 times in
100  then  if we know that of those who go to india 3 in 1000 are
bitten  we can calculate what the chances are that any one going to
india will die of a cobra s bite  chap  xx   

  6  verbal and real propositions   another important division of
propositions turns upon the relation of the predicate to the subject in
respect of their connotations  we saw  when discussing relative terms 
that the connotation of one term often implies that of another 
sometimes reciprocally  like  master  and  slave   or by inclusion  like
species and genus  or by exclusion  like contraries and contradictories 
when terms so related appear as subject and predicate of the same
proposition  the result is often tautology  e g    the master has
authority over his slave  a horse is an animal  red is not blue  british
is not foreign   whoever knows the meaning of  master    horse    red  
 british   learns nothing from these propositions  hence they are called
verbal propositions  as only expounding the sense of words  or as if
they were propositions only by satisfying the forms of language  not by
fulfilling the function of propositions in conveying a knowledge of
facts  they are also called  analytic  and  explicative   when they
separate and disengage the elements of the connotation of the subject 
doubtless  such propositions may be useful to one who does not know the
language  and definitions  which are verbal propositions whose
predicates analyse the whole connotations of their subjects  are
indispensable instruments of science  see chap  xxii   

of course  hypothetical propositions may also be verbal  as  if the soul
be material it is extended   for  extension  is connoted by  matter  
and  therefore  the corresponding disjunctive is verbal   either the
soul is not material  or it is extended   but a true divisional
disjunctive can never be verbal  chap  xxi    4  rule 1  

on the other hand  when there is no such direct relation between subject
and predicate that their connotations imply one another  but the
predicate connotes something that cannot be learnt from the connotation
of the subject  there is no longer tautology  but an enlargement of
meaning  e g    masters are degraded by their slaves  the horse is the
noblest animal  red is the favourite colour of the british army  if the
soul is simple  it is indestructible   such propositions are called
real  synthetic  or ampliative  because they are propositions for which
a mere understanding of their subjects would be no substitute  since the
predicate adds a meaning of its own concerning matter of fact 

to any one who understands the language  a verbal proposition can never
be an inference or conclusion from evidence  nor can a verbal
proposition ever furnish grounds for an inference  except as to the
meaning of words  the subject of real and verbal propositions will
inevitably recur in the chapters on definition  but tautologies are such
common blemishes in composition  and such frequent pitfalls in argument 
that attention cannot be drawn to them too early or too often 




chapter vi

conditions of immediate inference


  1  the word inference is used in two different senses  which are often
confused but should be carefully distinguished  in the first sense  it
means a process of thought or reasoning by which the mind passes from
facts or statements presented  to some opinion or expectation  the data
may be very vague and slight  prompting no more than a guess or surmise 
as when we look up at the sky and form some expectation about the
weather  or from the trick of a man s face entertain some prejudice as
to his character  or the data may be important and strongly significant 
like the footprint that frightened crusoe into thinking of cannibals  or
as when news of war makes the city expect that consols will fall  these
are examples of the act of inferring  or of inference as a process  and
with inference in this sense logic has nothing to do  it belongs to
psychology to explain how it is that our minds pass from one perception
or thought to another thought  and how we come to conjecture  conclude
and believe   cf   chap  i    6  

in the second sense   inference  means not this process of guessing or
opining  but the result of it  the surmise  opinion  or belief when
formed  in a word  the conclusion  and it is in this sense that
inference is treated of in logic  the subject matter of logic is an
inference  judgment or conclusion concerning facts  embodied in a
proposition  which is to be examined in relation to the evidence that
may be adduced for it  in order to determine whether  or how far  the
evidence amounts to proof  logic is the science of reasoning in the
sense in which  reasoning  means giving reasons  for it shows what sort
of reasons are good  whilst psychology explains how the mind goes
forward from data to conclusions  logic takes a conclusion and goes back
to the data  inquiring whether those data  together with any other
evidence  facts or principles  that can be collected  are of a nature to
warrant the conclusion  if we think that the night will be stormy  that
john doe is of an amiable disposition  that water expands in freezing 
or that one means to national prosperity is popular education  and wish
to know whether we have evidence sufficient to justify us in holding
these opinions  logic can tell us what form the evidence should assume
in order to be conclusive  what  form  the evidence should assume  logic
cannot tell us what kinds of fact are proper evidence in any of these
cases  that is a question for the man of special experience in life  or
in science  or in business  but whatever facts constitute the evidence 
they must  in order to prove the point  admit of being stated in
conformity with certain principles or conditions  and of these
principles or conditions logic is the science  it deals  then  not with
the subjective process of inferring  but with the objective grounds that
justify or discredit the inference 

  2  inferences  in the logical sense  are divided into two great
classes  the immediate and the mediate  according to the character of
the evidence offered in proof of them  strictly  to speak of inferences 
in the sense of conclusions  as immediate or mediate  is an abuse of
language  derived from times before the distinction between inference as
process and inference as result was generally felt  no doubt we ought
rather to speak of immediate and mediate evidence  but it is of little
use to attempt to alter the traditional expressions of the science 

an immediate inference  then  is one that depends for its proof upon
only one other proposition  which has the same  or more extensive 
terms  or matter   thus that  one means to national prosperity is
popular education  is an immediate inference  if the evidence for it is
no more than the admission that  popular education is a means to
national prosperity   similarly  it is an immediate inference that  some
authors are vain   if it be granted that  all authors are vain  

an immediate inference may seem to be little else than a verbal
transformation  some logicians dispute its claims to be called an
inference at all  on the ground that it is identical with the pretended
evidence  if we attend to the meaning  say they  an immediate inference
does not really express any new judgment  the fact expressed by it is
either the same as its evidence  or is even less significant  if from
 no men are gods  we prove that  no gods are men   this is nugatory  if
we prove from it that  some men are not gods   this is to emasculate the
sense  to waste valuable information  to lose the commanding sweep of
our universal proposition 

still  in logic  it is often found that an immediate inference expresses
our knowledge in a more convenient form than that of the evidentiary
proposition  as will appear in the chapter on syllogisms and elsewhere 
and by transforming an universal into a particular proposition  as  no
men are gods   therefore   some men are not gods    we get a statement
which  though weaker  is far more easily proved  since a single instance
suffices  moreover  by drawing all possible immediate inferences from a
given proposition  we see it in all its aspects  and learn all that is
implied in it 

a mediate inference  on the other hand  depends for its evidence upon a
plurality of other propositions  two or more  which are connected
together on logical principles  if we argue  

      no men are gods 
      alexander the great is a man 
    ‚à¥ alexander the great is not a god 

this is a mediate inference  the evidence consists of two propositions
connected by the term  man   which is common to both  a middle term  
mediating between  gods  and  alexander   mediate inferences comprise
syllogisms with their developments  and inductions  and to discuss them
further at present would be to anticipate future chapters  we must now
deal with the principles or conditions on which immediate inferences are
valid  commonly called the  laws of thought  

  3  the laws of thought are conditions of the logical statement and
criticism of all sorts of evidence  but as to immediate inference  they
may be regarded as the only conditions it need satisfy  they are often
expressed thus   1  the principle of identity    whatever is  is     2 
the principle of contradiction    it is impossible for the same thing to
be and not be     3  the principle of excluded middle    anything must
either be or not be    these principles are manifestly not  laws  of
thought in the sense in which  law  is used in psychology  they do not
profess to describe the actual mental processes that take place in
judgment or reasoning  as the  laws of association of ideas  account for
memory and recollection  they are not natural laws of thought  but  in
relation to thought  can only be regarded as laws when stated as
precepts  the observance of which  consciously or not  is necessary to
clear and consistent thinking  e g   never assume that the same thing
can both be and not be 

however  treating logic as the science of thought only as embodied in
propositions  in respect of which evidence is to be adduced  or which
are to be used as evidence of other propositions  the above laws or
principles must be restated as the conditions of consistent argument in
such terms as to be directly applicable to propositions  it was shown in
the chapter on the connotation of terms  that terms are assumed by
logicians to be capable of definite meaning  and of being used
univocally in the same context  if  or in so far as  this is not the
case  we cannot understand one another s reasons nor even pursue in
solitary meditation any coherent train of argument  we saw  too  that
the meanings of terms were related to one another  some being full
correlatives  others partially inclusive one of another  as species of
genus  others mutually incompatible  as contraries  or alternatively
predicable  as contradictories  we now assume that propositions are
capable of definite meaning according to the meaning of their component
terms and of the relation between them  that the meaning  the fact
asserted or denied  is what we are really concerned to prove or
disprove  that a mere change in the words that constitute our terms  or
of construction  does not affect the truth of a proposition as long as
the meaning is not altered  or  rather  as long as no fresh meaning is
introduced  and that if the meaning of any proposition is true  any
other proposition that denies it is false  this postulate is plainly
necessary to consistency of statement and discourse  and consistency is
necessary  if our thought or speech is to correspond with the unity and
coherence of nature and experience  and the laws of thought or
conditions of immediate inference are an analysis of this postulate 

  4  the principle of identity is usually written symbolically thus   a
is a  not a is not a   it assumes that there is something that may be
represented by a term  and it requires that  in any discussion   every
relevant term  once used in a definite sense  shall keep that meaning
throughout   socrates in his father s workshop  at the battle of delium 
and in prison  is assumed to be the same man denotable by the same name 
and similarly   elephant   or  justice   or  fairy   in the same
context  is to be understood of the same thing under the same
 suppositio  

but  further  it is assumed that of a given term another term may be
predicated again and again in the same sense under the same conditions 
that is  we may speak of the identity of meaning in a proposition as
well as in a term  to symbolise this we ought to alter the usual
formula for identity and write it thus   if b is a  b is a  if b is
not a  b is not a   if socrates is wise  he is wise  if fairies frequent
the moonlight  they do  if justice is not of this world  it is not 
 whatever affirmation or denial we make concerning any subject  we are
bound to adhere to it for the purposes of the current argument or
investigation   of course  if our assertion turns out to be false  we
must not adhere to it  but then we must repudiate all that we formerly
deduced from it 

again   whatever is true or false in one form of words is true or false
in any other   this is undeniable  for the important thing is identity
of meaning  but in formal logic it is not very convenient  if socrates
is wise  is it an identity to say  therefore the master of plato is
wise   or  further that he  takes enlightened views of life   if  every
man is fallible   is it an identical proposition that  every man is
liable to error   it seems pedantic to demand a separate proposition
that  fallible is liable to error   but  on the other hand  the
insidious substitution of one term for another speciously identical  is
a chief occasion of fallacy  how if we go on to argue  therefore   every
man is apt to blunder  prone to confusion of thought  inured to
self contradiction   practically  the substitution of identities must be
left to candour and good sense  and may they increase among us  formal
logic is  no doubt  safest with symbols  should  perhaps  content itself
with a and b  or  at least  hardly venture beyond y and z 

  5  the principle of contradiction is usually written symbolically 
thus   a is not not a   but  since this formula seems to be adapted to a
single term  whereas we want one that is applicable to propositions  it
may be better to write it thus   b is not both a and not a   that is to
say   if any term may be affirmed of a subject  the contradictory term
may  in the same relation  be denied of it   a leaf that is green on one
side of it may be not green on the other  but it is not both green and
not green on the same surface  at the same time  and in the same light 
if a stick is straight  it is false that it is at the same time
not straight  having granted that two angles are equal  we must deny
that they are unequal 

but is it necessarily false that the stick is  crooked   must we deny
that either angle is  greater or less  than the other  how far is it
permissible to substitute any other term for the formal contradictory 
clearly  the principle of contradiction takes for granted the principle
of identity  and is subject to the same difficulties in its practical
application  as a matter of fact and common sense  if we affirm any term
of a subject  we are bound to deny of that subject  in the same
relation  not only the contradictory but all synonyms for this  and also
all contraries and opposites  which  of course  are included in the
contradictory  but who shall determine what these are  without an
authoritative logical dictionary to refer to  where all contradictories 
synonyms  and contraries may be found on record  formal logic will
hardly sanction the free play of common sense 

the principle of excluded middle may be written   b is either a or
not a   that is   if any term be denied of a subject  the contradictory
term may  in the same relation  be affirmed   of course  we may deny
that a leaf is green on one side without being bound to affirm that it
is not green on the other  but in the same relation a leaf is either
green or not green  at the same time  a stick is either bent or
not bent  if we deny that a is greater than b  we must affirm that it is
not greater than b 

whilst  then  the principle of contradiction  that  of contradictory
predicates  one being affirmed  the other is denied    might seem to
leave open a third or middle course  the denying of both
contradictories  the principle of excluded middle derives its name from
the excluding of this middle course  by declaring that the one or the
other must be affirmed  hence the principle of excluded middle does not
hold good of mere contrary terms  if we deny that a leaf is green  we
are not bound to affirm it to be yellow  for it may be red  and then we
may deny both contraries  yellow and green  in fact  two contraries do
not between them cover the whole predicable area  but contradictories
do  the form of their expression is such that  within the  suppositio  
each includes all that the other excludes  so that the subject  if
brought within the  suppositio   must fall under the one or the other 
it may seem absurd to say that mont blanc is either wise or not wise 
but how comes any mind so ill organised as to introduce mont blanc into
this strange company  being there  however  the principle is inexorable 
mont blanc is not wise 

in fact  the principles of contradiction and excluded middle are
inseparable  they are implicit in all distinct experience  and may be
regarded as indicating the two aspects of negation  the principle of
contradiction says   b is not both a and not a   as if  not a  might be
nothing at all  this is abstract negation  but the principle of excluded
middle says   granting that b is not a  it is still something   namely 
 not a   thus bringing us back to the concrete experience of a continuum
in which the absence of one thing implies the presence of something
else  symbolically  to deny that b is a is to affirm that b is not a 
and this only differs by a hyphen from b is not a 

these principles  which were necessarily to some extent anticipated in
chap  iv    7  the next chapter will further illustrate 

  6  but first we must draw attention to a maxim  also already
mentioned   which is strictly applicable to immediate inferences  though
 as we shall see  in other kinds of proof it may be only a formal
condition  this is the general caution  not to go beyond the evidence  
an immediate inference ought to contain nothing that is not contained
 or formally implied  in the proposition by which it is proved  with
respect to quantity in denotation  this caution is embodied in the rule
 not to distribute any term that is not given distributed   thus  if
there is a predication concerning  some s   or  some men   as in the
forms i  and o   we cannot infer anything concerning  all s   or  all
men   and  as we have seen  if a term is given us preindesignate  we are
generally to take it as of particular quantity  similarly  in the case
of affirmative propositions  we saw that this rule requires us to assume
that their predicates are undistributed 

as to the grounds of this maxim  not to go beyond the evidence  not to
distribute a term that is given as undistributed  it is one of the
things so plain that to try to justify is only to obscure them  still 
we must here state explicitly what formal logic assumes to be contained
or implied in the evidence afforded by any proposition  such as  all s
is p   if we remember that in chap  iv    7  it was assumed that every
term may have a contradictory  and if we bear in mind the principles of
contradiction and excluded middle  it will appear that such a
proposition as  all s is p  tells us something not only about the
relations of  s  and  p   but also of their relations to  not s  and
 not p   as  for example  that  s is not not p   and that  not p is
not s   it will be shown in the next chapter how logicians have
developed these implications in series of immediate inferences 

if it be asked whether it is true that every term  itself significant 
has a significant contradictory  and not merely a formal contradictory 
generated by force of the word  not   it is difficult to give any better
answer than was indicated in    3 5  without venturing further into
metaphysics  i shall merely say  therefore  that  granting that some
such term as  universe  or  being  may have no significant
contradictory  if it stand for  whatever can be perceived or thought
of   yet every term that stands for less than  universe  or  being  has 
of course  a contradictory which denotes the rest of the universe  and
since every argument or train of thought is carried on within a special
 universe of discourse   or under a certain  suppositio   we may say
that  within the given suppositio every term has a contradictory   and
that every predication concerning a term implies some predication
concerning its contradictory  but the name of the  suppositio  itself
has no contradictory  except with reference to a wider and inclusive
 suppositio  

the difficulty of actual reasoning  not with symbols  but about matters
of fact  does not arise from the principles of logic  but sometimes from
the obscurity or complexity of the facts  sometimes from the ambiguity
or clumsiness of language  sometimes from the deficiency of our own
minds in penetration  tenacity and lucidity  one must do one s best to
study the facts  and not be too easily discouraged 




chapter vii

immediate inferences


  1  under the general title of immediate inference logicians discuss
three subjects  namely  opposition  conversion  and obversion  to which
some writers add other forms  such as whole and part in connotation 
contraposition  inversion  etc  of opposition  again  all recognise
four modes  subalternation  contradiction  contrariety and
sub contrariety  the only peculiarities of the exposition upon which we
are now entering are  that it follows the lead of the three laws of
thought  taking first those modes of immediate inference in which
identity is most important  then those which plainly involve
contradiction and excluded middle  and that this method results in
separating the modes of opposition  connecting subalternation with
conversion  and the other modes with obversion  to make up for this
departure from usage  the four modes of opposition will be brought
together again in   9 

  2  subalternation   opposition being the relation of propositions that
have the same matter and differ only in form  as a   e   i   o   
propositions of the forms a  and i  are said to be subalterns in
relation to one another  and so are e  and o   the universal of each
quality being distinguished as  subalternans   and the particular as
 subalternate  

it follows from the principle of identity that  the matter of the
propositions being the same  if a  is true i  is true  and that if e  is
true o  is true  for a  and e  predicate something of  all s  or  all
men   and since i  and o  make the same predication of  some s  or
 some men   the sense of these particular propositions has already been
predicated in a  or e  if  all s is p  some s is p   if  no s is p  some
s is not p   or  if  all men are fond of laughing  some men are   if  no
men are exempt from ridicule  some men are not  

similarly  if i  is false a  is false  if o  is false e  is false  if we
deny any predication about  some s   we must deny it of  all s   since
in denying it of  some   we have denied it of at least part of  all  
and whatever is false in one form of words is false in any other 

on the other hand  if i  is true  we do not know that a  is  nor if o 
is true  that e  is  for to infer from  some  to  all  would be going
beyond the evidence  we shall see in discussing induction that the great
problem of that part of logic is  to determine the conditions under
which we may in reality transcend this rule and infer from  some  to
 all   though even there it will appear that  formally  the rule is
observed  for the present it is enough that i  is an immediate inference
from a   and o  from e   but that a  is not an immediate inference from
i   nor e  from o 

  3  connotative subalternation   we have seen  chap  iv    6  that if
the connotation of one term is only part of another s its denotation is
greater and includes that other s  hence genus and species stand in
subaltern relation  and whatever is true of the genus is true of the
species  if  all animal life is dependent on vegetation  all human life
is dependent on vegetation   on the other hand  whatever is not true of
the species or narrower term  cannot be true of the whole genus  if it
is false that   all human life is happy    it is false that   all animal
life is happy   

similar inferences may be drawn from the subaltern relation of
predicates  affirming the species we affirm the genus  to take mill s
example  if  socrates is a man  socrates is a living creature   on the
other hand  denying the genus we deny the species  if  socrates is not
vicious  socrates is not drunken  

such cases as these are recognised by mill and bain as immediate
inferences under the principle of identity  but some logicians might
treat them as imperfect syllogisms  requiring another premise to
legitimate the conclusion  thus 

       all animal life is dependent on vegetation 
      all human life is animal life 
    ‚à¥ all human life is dependent on vegetation  

or again 

       all men are living creatures 
      socrates is a man 
    ‚à¥ socrates is a living creature  

the decision of this issue turns upon the question   cf   chap  vi    3 
how far a logician is entitled to assume that the terms he uses are
understood  and that the identities involved in their meanings will be
recognised  and to this question  for the sake of consistency  one of
two answers is required  failing which  there remains the rule of thumb 
first  it may be held that no terms are understood except those that are
defined in expounding the science  such as  genus  and  species  
 connotation  and  denotation   but very few logicians observe this
limitation  few would hesitate to substitute  not wise  for  foolish  
yet by what right  malvolio being foolish  to prove that he is not wise 
we may construct the following syllogism 

       foolish is not wise 
      malvolio is foolish 
    ‚à¥ malvolio is not wise  

is this necessary  why not 

secondly  it may be held that all terms may be assumed as understood
unless a definition is challenged  this principle will justify the
substitution of  not wise  for  foolish   but it will also legitimate
the above cases  concerning  human life  and  socrates   as immediate
inferences  with innumerable others that might be based upon the
doctrine of relative terms  for example   the hunter missed his aim  
therefore   the prey escaped   and from this principle it will further
follow that all apparent syllogisms  having one premise a verbal
proposition  are immediate inferences   cf   chap  ix    4  

closely connected with such cases as the above are those mentioned by
archbishop thomson as  immediate inferences by added determinants 
  laws of thought     87   he takes the case    a negro is a
fellow creature   therefore   a negro in suffering is a fellow creature
in suffering    this rests upon the principle that to increase the
connotations of two terms by the same attribute or determinant does not
affect the relationship of their denotations  since it must equally
diminish  if at all  the denotations of both classes  by excluding the
same individuals  if any want the given attribute  but this principle is
true only when the added attribute is not merely the same verbally  but
has the same significance in qualifying both terms  we cannot argue  a
mouse is an animal   therefore   a large mouse is a large animal   for
 large  is an attribute relative to the normal magnitude of the thing
described 

  4  conversion is immediate inference by transposing the terms of a
given proposition without altering its quality  if the quantity is also
unaltered  the inference is called  simple conversion   but if the
quantity is changed from universal to particular  it is called
 conversion by limitation  or   per accidens    the given proposition is
called the  convertend   that which is derived from it  the  converse  

departing from the usual order of exposition  i have taken up conversion
next to subalternation  because it is generally thought to rest upon the
principle of identity  and because it seems to be a good method to
exhaust the forms that come only under identity before going on to those
that involve contradiction and excluded middle  some  indeed  dispute
the claims of conversion to illustrate the principle of identity  and
if the sufficient statement of that principle be  a is a   it may be a
question how conversion or any other mode of inference can be referred
to it  but if we state it as above  chap  vi    3   that whatever is
true in one form of words is true in any other  there is no difficulty
in applying it to conversion 

thus  to take the simple conversion of i  

     some s is p  ‚à¥ some p is s  
     some poets are business like  ‚à¥ some business like men are poets  

here the convertend and the converse say the same thing  and this is
true if that is 

we have  then  two cases of simple conversion  of i   as above  and of
e  for e  

     no s is p  ‚à¥ no p is s  
     no ruminants are carnivores  ‚à¥ no carnivores are ruminants  

in converting i   the predicate  p  when taken as the new subject  being
preindesignate  is treated as particular  and in converting e   the
predicate  p   when taken as the new subject  is treated as universal 
according to the rule in chap  v    1 

a  is the one case of conversion by limitation 

    all s is p 
    ‚à¥ some p is s 

    all cats are grey in the dark 
    ‚à¥ some things grey in the dark are cats 

the predicate is treated as particular  when taking it for the new
subject  according to the rule not to go beyond the evidence  to infer
that  all things grey in the dark are cats  would be palpably absurd 
yet no error of reasoning is commoner than the simple conversion of a 
the validity of conversion by limitation may be shown thus  if   all s
is p   then  by subalternation   some s is p   and therefore  by simple
conversion   some p is s  

o  cannot be truly converted  if we take the proposition   some s is
not p   to convert this into  no p is s   or  some p is not s   would
break the rule in chap  vi    6  since  s   undistributed in the
convertend  would be distributed in the converse  if we are told that
 some men are not cooks   we cannot infer that  some cooks are not men  
this would be to assume that   some men   are identical with   all
men   

by quantifying the predicate  indeed  we may convert o  simply  thus 

     some men are not cooks  ‚à¥  no cooks are some men  

and the same plan has some advantage in converting a   for by the usual
method  per accidens   the converse of a  being i   if we convert this
again it is still i   and therefore means less than our original
convertend  thus 

     all s is p ‚à¥ some p is s ‚à¥ some s is p  

such knowledge  as that  all s   the whole of it   is p   is too
precious a thing to be squandered in pure logic  and it may be preserved
by quantifying the predicate  for if we convert a  to y   thus  

     all s is p ‚à¥ some p is all s   

we may reconvert y  to a  without any loss of meaning  it is the chief
use of quantifying the predicate that  thereby  every proposition is
capable of simple conversion 

the conversion of propositions in which the relation of terms is
inadequately expressed  see chap  ii     2  by the ordinary copula   is 
or  is not   needs a special rule  to argue thus  

     a is followed by b  ‚à¥  something followed by b is a   

would be clumsy formalism  we usually say  and we ought to say  

     a is followed by b  ‚à¥  b follows a   or  is preceded by a   

now  any relation between two terms may be viewed from either side   a 
b  or  b  a   it is in both cases the same fact  but  with the altered
point of view  it may present a different character  for example  in the
immediate inference   a   b  ‚à¥  b < a   a diminishing turns into an
increasing ratio  whilst the fact predicated remains the same  given 
then  a relation between two terms as viewed from one to the other  the
same relation viewed from the other to the one may be called the
reciprocal  in the cases of equality  co existence and simultaneity  the
given relation and its reciprocal are not only the same fact  but they
also have the same character  in the cases of greater and less and
sequence  the character alters 

we may  then  state the following rule for the conversion of
propositions in which the whole relation explicitly stated is taken as
the copula  transpose the terms  and for the given relation substitute
its reciprocal  thus  

     a is the cause of b ‚à¥ b is the effect of a  

the rule assumes that the reciprocal of a given relation is definitely
known  and so far as this is true it may be extended to more concrete
relations  

     a is a genus of b ‚à¥ b is a species of a
    a is the father of b ‚à¥ b is a child of a  

but not every relational expression has only one definite reciprocal  if
we are told that  a is the brother of b   we can only infer that  b is
either the brother or the sister of a   a list of all reciprocal
relations is a desideratum of logic 

  5  obversion  otherwise called permutation or √¶quipollence  is
immediate inference by changing the quality of the given proposition and
substituting for its predicate the contradictory term  the given
proposition is called the  obvertend   and the inference from it the
 obverse   thus the obvertend being   some philosophers are consistent
reasoners   the obverse will be   some philosophers are not inconsistent
reasoners  

the legitimacy of this mode of reasoning follows  in the case of
affirmative propositions  from the principle of contradiction  that if
any term be affirmed of a subject  the contradictory term may be denied
 chap  vi    3   to obvert affirmative propositions  then  the rule
is  insert the negative sign  and for the predicate substitute its
contradictory term 

    a   all s is p ‚à¥ no s is not p
       all men are fallible ‚à¥ no men are infallible  

    i   some s is p ‚à¥ some s is not p
       some philosophers are consistent ‚à¥ some philosophers are not
         inconsistent  

in agreement with this mode of inference  we have the rule of modern
english grammar  that  two negatives make an affirmative  

again  by the principle of excluded middle  if any term be denied of a
subject  its contradictory may be affirmed  to obvert negative
propositions  then  the rule is  remove the negative sign  and for the
predicate substitute its contradictory term 

    e   no s is p ‚à¥ all s is not p
       no matter is destructible ‚à¥ all matter is indestructible  

    o   some s is not p ‚à¥ some s is not p
       some ideals are not attainable ‚à¥ some ideals are unattainable  

thus  by obversion  each of the four propositions retains its quantity
but changes its quality  a  to e   i  to o   e  to a   o  to i  and all
the obverses are infinite propositions  the affirmative infinites having
the sense of negatives  and the negative infinites having the sense of
affirmatives 

again  having obtained the obverse of a given proposition  it may be
desirable to recover the obvertend  or it may at any time be requisite
to change a given infinite proposition into the corresponding direct
affirmative or negative  and in such cases the process is still
obversion  thus  if  no s is not p  be given us to recover the obvertend
or to find the corresponding affirmative  the proposition being formally
negative  we apply the rule for obverting negatives   remove the
negative sign  and for the predicate substitute its contradictory   this
yields the affirmative  all s is p   similarly  to obtain the obvertend
of  all s is not p   apply the rule for obverting affirmatives  and this
yields  no s is p  

  6  contrariety   we have seen in chap  iv    8  that contrary terms
are such that no two of them are predicable in the same way of the same
subject  whilst perhaps neither may be predicable of it  similarly 
contrary propositions may be defined as those of which no two are ever
both true together  whilst perhaps neither may be true  or  in other
words  both may be false  this is the relation between a  and e  when
concerned with the same matter  as a    all men are wise   e    no men
are wise   such propositions cannot both be true  but they may both be
false  for some men may be wise and some not  they cannot both be true 
for  by the principle of contradiction  if  wise  may be affirmed of
 all men  not wise  must be denied  but  all men are not wise  is the
obverse of  no men are wise   which therefore may also be denied 

at the same time we cannot apply to a  and e  the principle of excluded
middle  so as to show that one of them must be true of the same matter 
for if we deny that  all men are wise   we do not necessarily deny the
attribute  wise  of each and every man  to say that  not all are wise 
may mean no more than that  some are not   this gives a proposition in
the form of o   which  as we have seen  does not imply its subalternans 
e 

if  however  two singular propositions  having the same matter  but
differing in quality  are to be treated as universals  and therefore as
a  and e   they are  nevertheless  contradictory and not merely
contrary  for one of them must be false and the other true 

  7  contradiction is a relation between two propositions analogous to
that between contradictory terms  one of which being affirmed of a
subject the other is denied   such  namely  that one of them is false
and the other true  this is the case with the forms a  and o   and e 
and i   in the same matter  if it be true that  all men are wise   it is
false that  some men are not wise   equivalent by obversion to  some
men are not wise    or else  since the  some men  are included in the
 all men   we should be predicating of the same men that they are both
 wise  and  not wise   which would violate the principle of
contradiction  similarly   no men are wise   being by obversion
equivalent to  all men are not wise   is incompatible with  some men are
wise   by the same principle of contradiction 

but  again  if it be false that  all men are wise   it is always true
that  some are not wise   for though in denying that  wise  is a
predicate of  all men  we do not deny it of each and every man  yet we
deny it of  some men   of  some men   therefore  by the principle of
excluded middle   not wise  is to be affirmed  and  some men are
not wise   is by obversion equivalent to  some men are not wise  
similarly  if it be false that  no men are wise   which by obversion is
equivalent to  all men are not wise   then it is true at least that
 some men are wise  

by extending and enforcing the doctrine of relative terms  certain other
inferences are implied in the contrary and contradictory relations of
propositions  we have seen in chap  iv  that the contradictory of a
given term includes all its contraries   not blue   for example 
includes red and yellow  hence  since  the sky is blue  becomes by
obversion   the sky is not not blue   we may also infer  the sky is not
red   etc  from the truth  then  of any proposition predicating a given
term  we may infer the falsity of all propositions predicating the
contrary terms in the same relation  but  on the other hand  from the
falsity of a proposition predicating a given term  we cannot infer the
truth of the predication of any particular contrary term  if it be false
that  the sky is red   we cannot formally infer  that  the sky is blue 
  cf   chap  iv    8  

  8  sub contrariety is the relation of two propositions  concerning the
same matter that may both be true but are never both false  this is the
case with i  and o  if it be true that  some men are wise   it may also
be true that  some  other  men are not wise   this follows from the
maxim in chap  vi    6  not to go beyond the evidence 

for if it be true that  some men are wise   it may indeed be true that
 all are   this being the subalternans   and if  all are   it is  by
contradiction  false that  some are not   but as we are only told that
 some men are   it is illicit to infer the falsity of  some are not  
which could only be justified by evidence concerning  all men  

but if it be false that  some men are wise   it is true that  some men
are not wise   for  by contradiction  if  some men are wise  is false 
 no men are wise  is true  and  therefore  by subalternation   some men
are not wise  is true 

  9  the square of opposition   by their relations of subalternation 
contrariety  contradiction  and sub contrariety  the forms a  i  e  o 
 having the same matter  are said to stand in opposition  and logicians
represent these relations by a square having a  i  e  o  at its corners 

a       contraries      e 

s    co             s   s
u      nt          e    u
b        ra       i     b
a          di    r      a
l            ct o       l
t            ct o       t
e          di    r      e
r        ra       i     r
n      nt          e    n
s    co             s   s

i    sub contraries     o 

as an aid to the memory  this diagram is useful  but as an attempt to
represent the logical relations of propositions  it is misleading  for 
standing at corners of the same square  a  and e   a  and i   e  and o  
and i  and o   seem to be couples bearing the same relation to one
another  whereas we have seen that their relations are entirely
different  the following traditional summary of their relations in
respect of truth and falsity is much more to the purpose 

     1  if a  is true    i  is true      e  is false     o  is false 
     2  if a  is false   i  is unknown   e  is unknown   o  is true 
     3  if i  is true    a  is unknown   e  is false     o  is unknown 
     4  if i  is false   a  is false     e  is true      o  is true 
     5  if e  is true    a  is false     i  is false     o  is true 
     6  if e  is false   a  is unknown   i  is true      o  is unknown 
     7  if o  is true    a  is false     i  is unknown   e  is unknown 
     8  if o  is false   a  is true      i  is true      e  is false 

where  however  as in cases 2  3  6  7  alleging either the
falsity of universals or the truth of particulars  it follows that two
of the three opposites are unknown  we may conclude further that one of
them must be true and the other false  because the two unknown are
always contradictories 

  10  secondary modes of immediate inference are obtained by applying
the process of conversion or obversion to the results already obtained
by the other process  the best known secondary form of immediate
inference is the contrapositive  and this is the converse of the obverse
of a given proposition  thus 

        datum                   obverse           contrapositive 

    a   all s is p       ‚à¥  no s is not p        ‚à¥  no not p is s 
    i   some s is p      ‚à¥  some s is not not p  ‚à¥  none 
    e   no s is p        ‚à¥  all s is not p       ‚à¥  some not p is s 
    o   some s is not p  ‚à¥  some s is not p      ‚à¥  some not p is s 

there is no contrapositive of i   because the obverse of i  is in the
form of o   and we have seen that o  cannot be converted  o   however 
has a contrapositive   some not p is s    and this is sometimes given
instead of the converse  and called the  converse by negation  

contraposition needs no justification by the laws of thought  as it is
nothing but a compounding of conversion with obversion  both of which
processes have already been justified  i give a table opposite of the
other ways of compounding these primary modes of immediate inference 

                     a                i               e                 o

be read thus  for  no a is b  no a is not b   for  all b is a   col  6  
 all not b is not a   and so on 

it may not  at first  be obvious why the process of alternately
obverting and converting any proposition should ever come to an end 
though it will  no doubt  be considered a very fortunate circumstance
that it always does end  on examining the results  it will be found that
the cause of its ending is the inconvertibility of o  for e   when
obverted  becomes a   every a  when converted  degenerates into i  
every i   when obverted  becomes o   o cannot be converted  and to
obvert it again is merely to restore the former proposition  so that the
whole process moves on to inevitable dissolution  i  and o  are
exhausted by three transformations  whilst a  and e  will each endure
seven 

except obversion  conversion and contraposition  it has not been usual
to bestow special names on these processes or their results  but the
form in columns 7 and 10   some a is b  some a is not b    where the
original predicate is affirmed or denied of the contradictory of the
original subject  has been thought by dr  keynes to deserve a
distinctive title  and he has called it the  inverse   whilst the
inverse is one form  however  inversion is not one process  but is
obtained by different processes from e  and a  respectively  in this it
differs from obversion  conversion  and contraposition  each of which
stands for one process 

the inverse form has been objected to on the ground that the inference
 all a is b ‚à¥ some not a is not b   distributes  b   as predicate of a
negative proposition   though it was given as undistributed  as
predicate of an affirmative proposition   but dr  keynes defends it on
the ground that  1  it is obtained by obversions and conversions which
are all legitimate and  2  that although  all a is b  does not
distribute  b  in relation to  a   it does distribute  b  in relation to
some  not a   namely  in relation to whatever  not a  is  not b    this
is one reason why  in stating the rule in chap  vi    6  i have
written   an immediate inference ought to contain nothing that is not
contained   or formally implied   in the proposition from which it is
inferred   and have maintained that every term formally implies its
contradictory within the  suppositio  

  11  immediate inferences from conditionals are those which
consist   1  in changing a disjunctive into a hypothetical  or a
hypothetical into a disjunctive  or either into a categorical  and  2 
in the relations of opposition and the equivalences of obversion 
conversion  and secondary or compound processes  which we have already
examined in respect of categoricals  as no new principles are involved 
it may suffice to exhibit some of the results 

we have already seen  chap  v    4  how disjunctives may be read as
hypotheticals and hypotheticals as categoricals  and  as to opposition 
if we recognise four forms of hypothetical a  i  e  o   these plainly
stand to one another in a square of opposition  just as categoricals do 
thus a  and e    if a is b  c is d   and  if a is b  c is not d   are
contraries  but not contradictories  since both may be false   c  may
sometimes be  d   and sometimes not   though they cannot both be true 
and if they are both false  their subalternates are both true  being
respectively the contradictories of the universals of opposite quality 
namely  i  of e   and o  of a  but in the case of disjunctives  we
cannot set out a satisfactory square of opposition  because  as we saw
 chap  v    4   the forms required for e  and o  are not true
disjunctives  but exponibles 

the obverse  converse  and contrapositive  of hypotheticals  admitting
the distinction of quality  may be exhibited thus 

      datum                                         obverse 

a   if a is b  c is d                    if a is b  c is not d 
i  sometimes  when a is b  c is d       sometimes  when a is b  c is not d 
e   if a is b  c is not d                if a is b  c is d 
o  sometimes  when a is b  c is not d   sometimes  when a is b  c is d 

    converse                                    contrapositive 

sometimes  when c is d  a is b        if c is d  a is not b 
sometimes  when c is d  a is b                  none 
 if c is d  a is not b               sometimes  when c is d  a is b 
           none                      sometimes  when c is d  a is b 

as to disjunctives  the attempt to put them through these different
forms immediately destroys their disjunctive character  still  given any
proposition in the form  a is either b or c   we can state the
propositions that give the sense of obversion  conversion  etc   thus 

    datum    a is either b or c  
    obverse    a is not both b and c  
    converse    something  either b or c  is a  
    contrapositive    nothing that is both b and c is a  

for a disjunctive in i   of course  there is no contrapositive  given a
disjunctive in the form  either a is b or c is d   we may write for its
obverse   in no case is a b  and c at the same time d   but no converse
or contrapositive of such a disjunctive can be obtained  except by first
casting it into the hypothetical or categorical form 

the reader who wishes to pursue this subject further  will find it

order of terms  euler s diagrams  logical equations  existential import
of propositions


  1  of the terms of a proposition which is the subject and which the
predicate  in most of the exemplary propositions cited by logicians it
will be found that the subject is a substantive and the predicate an
adjective  as in  men are mortal   this is the relation of substance and
attribute which we saw  chap  i    5  to be the central type of
relations of coinherence  and on this model other predications may be
formed in which the subject is not a substance  but is treated as if it
were  and could therefore be the ground of attributes  as  fame is
treacherous  the weather is changeable   but  in literature  sentences
in which the adjective comes first are not uncommon  as  loud was the
applause  dark is the fate of man  blessed are the peacemakers   and so
on  here  then   loud    dark  and  blessed  occupy the place of the
logical subject  are they really the subject  or must we alter the order
of such sentences into  the applause was loud   etc   if we do  and then
proceed to convert  we get  loud was the applause   or  more
scrupulously   some loud noise was the applause   the last form  it is
true  gives the subject a substantive word  but  applause  has become
the predicate  and if the substantive  noise  was not implied in the
first form   loud is the applause   by what right is it now inserted 
the recognition of conversion  in fact  requires us to admit that 
formally  in a logical proposition  the term preceding the copula is
subject and the one following is predicate  and  of course  materially
considered  the mere order of terms in a proposition can make no
difference in the method of proving it  nor in the inferences that can
be drawn from it 

still  if the question is  how we may best cast a literary sentence into
logical form  good grounds for a definite answer may perhaps be found 
we must not try to stand upon the naturalness of expression  for  dark
is the fate of man  is quite as natural as  man is mortal   when the
purpose is not merely to state a fact  but also to express our feelings
about it  to place the grammatical predicate first may be perfectly
natural and most effective  but the grounds of a logical order of
statement must be found in its adaptation to the purposes of proof and
inference  now general propositions are those from which most inferences
can be drawn  which  therefore  it is most important to establish  if
true  and they are also the easiest to disprove  if false  since a
single negative instance suffices to establish the contradictory  it
follows that  in re casting a literary or colloquial sentence for
logical purposes  we should try to obtain a form in which the subject is
distributed  is either a singular term or a general term predesignate as
 all  or  no   seeing  then  that most adjectives connote a single
attribute  whilst most substantives connote more than one attribute  and
that therefore the denotation of adjectives is usually wider than that
of substantives  in any proposition  one term of which is an adjective
and the other a substantive  if either can be distributed in relation to
the other  it is nearly sure to be the substantive  so that to take the
substantive term for subject is our best chance of obtaining an
universal proposition  these considerations seem to justify the practice
of logicians in selecting their examples 

for similar reasons  if both terms of a proposition are substantive  the
one with the lesser denotation is  at least in affirmative
propositions  the more suitable subject  as  cats are carnivores   and
if one term is abstract  that is the more suitable subject  for  as we
have seen  an abstract term may be interpreted by a corresponding
concrete one distributed  as  kindness is infectious   that is   all
kind actions suggest imitation  

if  however  a controvertist has no other object in view than to refute
some general proposition laid down by an opponent  a particular
proposition is all that he need disentangle from any statement that
serves his purpose 

  2  toward understanding clearly the relations of the terms of a
proposition  it is often found useful to employ diagrams  and the
diagrams most in use are the circles of euler 

these circles represent the denotation of the terms  suppose the
proposition to be  all hollow horned animals ruminate   then  if we
could collect all ruminants upon a prairie  and enclose them with a
circular palisade  and segregate from amongst them all the hollow horned
beasts  and enclose them with another ring fence inside the other  one
way of interpreting the proposition  namely  in denotation  would be
figured to us thus 

 illustration  fig  1  

an universal affirmative may also state a relation between two terms
whose denotation is co extensive  a definition always does this  as  man
is a rational animal   and this  of course  we cannot represent by two
distinct circles  but at best by one with a thick circumference  to
suggest that two coincide  thus 

 illustration  fig  2  

the particular affirmative proposition may be represented in several
ways  in the first place  bearing in mind that  some  means  some at
least  it may be all   an i  proposition may be represented by figs  1
and 2  for it is true that  some horned animals ruminate   and that
 some men are rational   secondly  there is the case in which the  some
things  of which a predication is made are  in fact  not all  whilst the
predicate  though not given as distributed  yet might be so given if we
wished to state the whole truth  as if we say  some men are chinese  
this case is also represented by fig  1  the outside circle representing
 men   and the inside one  chinese   thirdly  the predicate may
appertain to some only of the subject  but to a great many other things 
as in  some horned beasts are domestic   for it is true that some are
not  and that certain other kinds of animals are  domestic  this case 
therefore  must be illustrated by overlapping circles  thus 

 illustration  fig  3  

the universal negative is sufficiently represented by a single fig   4  
two circles mutually exclusive  thus 

 illustration  fig  4  

that is   no horned beasts are carnivorous  

lastly  the particular negative may be represented by any of the figs 
1  3  and 4  for it is true that  some ruminants are not hollow horned  
that  some horned animals are not domestic   and that  some horned
beasts are not carnivorous  

besides their use in illustrating the denotative force of propositions 
these circles may be employed to verify the results of obversion 
conversion  and the secondary modes of immediate inference  thus the
obverse of a  is clear enough on glancing at figs  1 and 2  for if we
agree that whatever term s denotation is represented by a given circle 
the denotation of the contradictory term shall be represented by the
space outside that circle  then if it is true that  all hollow horned
animals are ruminants   it is at the same time true that  no
hollow horned animals are not ruminants   since none of the
hollow horned are found outside the palisade that encloses the
ruminants  the obverse of i   e  or o  may be verified in a similar
manner 

as to the converse  a definition is of course susceptible of simple
conversion  and this is shown by fig  2   men are rational animals  and
 rational animals are men   but any other a  proposition is presumably
convertible only by limitation  and this is shown by fig  1  where  all
hollow horned animals are ruminants   but we can only say that  some
ruminants are hollow horned  

that i  may be simply converted may be seen in fig  3  which represents
the least that an i  proposition can mean  and that e  may be simply
converted is manifest in fig  4 

as for o   we know that it cannot be converted  and this is made plain
enough by glancing at fig  1  for that represents the o    some
ruminants are not hollow horned   but also shows this to be compatible
with  all hollow horned animals are ruminants   a    now in conversion
there is  by definition  no change of quality  the converse  then  of
 some ruminants are not hollow horned  must be a negative proposition 
having  hollow horned  for its subject  either in e  or o   but these
would be respectively the contrary and contradictory of  all
hollow horned animals are ruminants   and  therefore  if this be true 
they must both be false 

but  referring still to fig  1  the legitimacy of contrapositing o  is
equally clear  for if  some ruminants are not hollow horned    some
animals that are not hollow horned are ruminants   namely  all the
animals between the two ring fences  similar inferences may be
illustrated from figs  3 and 4  and the contraposition of a  may be
verified by figs  1 and 2  and the contraposition of e  by fig  4 

lastly  the inverse of a  is plain from fig  1   some things that are
not hollow horned are not ruminants   namely  things that lie outside
the outer circle and are neither  ruminants  nor  hollow horned   and
the inverse of e may be studied in fig  4   some things that are
not horned beasts are carnivorous  

notwithstanding the facility and clearness of the demonstrations thus
obtained  it may be said that a diagrammatic method  representing
denotations  is not properly logical  fundamentally  the relation
asserted  or denied  to exist between the terms of a proposition  is a
relation between the terms as determined by their attributes or
connotation  whether we take mill s view  that a proposition asserts
that the connotation of the subject is a mark of the connotation of the
predicate  or dr  venn s view  that things denoted by the subject  as
having its connotation  have  or have not  the attribute connoted by the
predicate  or  the conceptualist view  that a judgment is a relation of
concepts  that is  of connotations   with a few exceptions artificially
framed  such as  kings now reigning in europe    the denotation of a
term is never directly and exhaustively known  but consists merely in
 all things that have the connotation   if the value of logical training
depends very much upon our habituating ourselves to construe
propositions  and to realise the force of inferences from them 
according to the connotation of their terms  we shall do well not to
turn too hastily to the circles  but rather to regard them as means of
verifying in denotation the conclusions that we have already learnt to
recognise as necessary in connotation 

  3  the equational treatment of propositions is closely connected with
the diagrammatic  hamilton thought it a great merit of his plan of
quantifying the predicate  that thereby every proposition is reduced to
its true form  an equation  according to this doctrine  the proposition
 all x is all y   u   equates x and y  the proposition  all x is some y 
 a   equates x with some part of y  and similarly with the other
affirmatives  y  and i    and so far it is easy to follow his meaning 
the xs are identical with some or all the ys  but  coming to the
negatives  the equational interpretation is certainly less obvious  the
proposition  no x is y   e   cannot be said in any sense to equate x and
y  though  if we obvert it into  all x is some not y   we have  in the
same sense  of course  as in the above affirmative forms  x equated with
part at least of  not y  

but what is that sense  clearly not the same as that in which
mathematical terms are equated  namely  in respect of some mode of
quantity  for if we may say  some x is some y   these xs that are also
ys are not merely the same in number  or mass  or figure  they are the
same in every respect  both quantitative and qualitative  have the same
positions in time and place  are in fact identical  the proposition
2 2=4 means that any two things added to any other two are   in respect
of number   equal to any three things added to one other thing  and this
is true of all things that can be counted  however much they may differ
in other ways  but  all x is all y  means that xs and ys are the same
things  although they have different names when viewed in different
aspects or relations  thus all equilateral triangles are equiangular
triangles  but in one case they are named from the equality of their
angles  and in the other from the equality of their sides  similarly 
 british subjects  and  subjects of king george v  are the same people 
named in one case from the person of the crown  and in the other from
the imperial government  these logical equations  then  are in truth
identities of denotation  and they are fully illustrated by the
relations of circles described in the previous section 

when we are told that logical propositions are to be considered as
equations  we naturally expect to be shown some interesting developments
of method in analogy with the equations of mathematics  but from
hamilton s innovations no such thing results  this cannot be said 
however  of the equations of symbolic logic  which are the
starting point of very remarkable processes of ratiocination  as the
subject of symbolic logic  as a whole  lies beyond the compass of this
work  it will be enough to give dr  venn s equations corresponding with
the four propositional forms of common logic 

according to this system  universal propositions are to be regarded as
not necessarily implying the existence of their terms  and therefore 
instead of giving them a positive form  they are translated into symbols
that express what they deny  for example  the proposition  all devils
are ugly  need not imply that any such things as  devils  really exist 
but it certainly does imply that  devils that are not ugly do not
exist   similarly  the proposition  no angels are ugly  implies that
 angels that are ugly do not exist   therefore  writing  x  for
 devils    y  for  ugly   and  yÃÑ  for  not ugly   we may express a  
the universal affirmative  thus 

    a   xyÃÑ  = 0 

that is   x that is not y is nothing   or   devils that are not ugly do
not exist   and  similarly  writing  x  for  angels  and  y  for  ugly  
we may express e   the universal negative  thus 

    e   xy  = 0 

that is   x that is y is nothing   or   angels that are ugly do not
exist  

on the other hand  particular propositions are regarded as implying the
existence of their terms  and the corresponding equations are so framed
as to express existence  with this end in view  the symbol v is adopted
to represent  something   or indeterminate reality  or more than
nothing  then  taking any particular affirmative  such as  some
metaphysicians are obscure   and writing  x  for  metaphysicians   and
 y  for  obscure   we may express it thus 

    i   xy  = v 

that is   x that is y is something   or   metaphysicians that are
obscure do occur in experience   however few they may be  or whether
they all be obscure   and  similarly  taking any particular negative 
such as  some giants are not cruel   and writing  x  for  giants  and
 y  for  not cruel   we may express it thus 

    o   xyÃÑ  = v 

that is   x that is not y is something   or   giants that are not cruel
do occur   in romances  if nowhere else 

clearly  these equations are  like hamilton s  concerned with
denotation  a  and e  affirm that the compound terms xyÃÑ and xy have no
denotation  and i  and o  declare that xyÃÑ and xy have denotation  or
stand for something  here  however  the resemblance to hamilton s system
ceases  for the symbolic logic  by operating upon more than two terms
simultaneously  by adopting the algebraic signs of operations       √ó  √∑
 with a special signification   and manipulating the symbols by
quasi algebraic processes  obtains results which the common logic
reaches  if at all  with much greater difficulty  if  indeed  the value
of logical systems were to be judged of by the results obtainable 
formal deductive logic would probably be superseded  and  as a mental
discipline  there is much to be said in favour of the symbolic method 
but  as an introduction to philosophy  the common logic must hold its
ground   venn   symbolic logic   c  7  

  4  does formal logic involve any general assumption as to the real
existence of the terms of propositions 

in the first place  logic treats primarily of the  relations  implied in
propositions  this follows from its being the science of proof for all
sorts of  qualitative  propositions  since all sorts of propositions
have nothing in common except the relations they express 

but  secondly  relations without terms of some sort are not to be
thought of  and  hence  even the most formal illustrations of logical
doctrines comprise such terms as s and p  x and y  or x and y  in a
symbolic or representative character  terms  therefore  of some sort are
assumed to exist  together with their negatives or contradictories   for
the purposes of logical manipulation  

thirdly  however  that formal logic cannot as such directly involve the
existence of any particular concrete terms  such as  man  or  mountain  
used by way of illustration  is implied in the word  formal   that is 
 confined to what is common or abstract   since the only thing common to
all terms is to be related in some way to other terms  the actual
existence of any concrete thing can only be known by experience  as with
 man  or  mountain   or by methodically justifiable inference from
experience  as with  atom  or  ether   if  man  or  mountain   or
 cuzco  be used to illustrate logical forms  they bring with them an
existential import derived from experience  but this is the import of
language  not of the logical forms   centaur  and  el dorado  signify to
us the non existent  but they serve as well as  man  and  london  to
illustrate formal logic 

nevertheless  fourthly  the existence or non existence of particular
terms may come to be implied  namely  wherever the very fact of
existence  or of some condition of existence  is an hypothesis or datum 
thus  given the proposition  all s is p   to be p is made a condition of
the existence of s  whence it follows that an s that is not p does not
exist   xyÃÑ  = 0   on the further hypothesis that s exists  it follows
that p exists  on the hypothesis that s does not exist  the existence of
p is problematic  but  then  if p does exist we cannot convert the
proposition  since  some p is s   p existing  would involve the
existence of s  which is contrary to the hypothesis 

assuming that universals  do not   whilst particulars  do   imply the
existence of their subjects  we cannot infer the subalternate  i  or o  
from the subalternans  a  or e    for that is to ground the actual on
the problematic  and for the same reason we cannot convert a   per
accidens  

assuming  again  a certain  suppositio  or universe  to which in a given
discussion every argument shall refer  then  any propositions whose
terms lie outside that  suppositio  are irrelevant  and for the purposes
of that discussion are sometimes called  false   though it seems better
to call them irrelevant or meaningless  seeing that to call them false
implies that they might in the same case be true  thus propositions
which  according to the doctrine of opposition  appear to be
contradictories  may then cease to be so  for of contradictories one is
true and the other false  but  in the case supposed  both are
meaningless  if the subject of discussion be zoology  all propositions
about centaurs or unicorns are absurd  and such specious
contradictories as  no centaurs play the lyre  some centaurs do play the
lyre   or  all unicorns fight with lions  some unicorns do not fight
with lions   are both meaningless  because in zoology there are no
centaurs nor unicorns  and  therefore  in this reference  the
propositions are not really contradictory  but if the subject of
discussion or  suppositio  be mythology or heraldry  such propositions
as the above are to the purpose  and form legitimate pairs of
contradictories 

in formal logic  in short  we may make at discretion any assumption
whatever as to the existence  or as to any condition of the existence of
any particular term or terms  and then certain implications and
conclusions follow in consistency with that hypothesis or datum  still 
our conclusions will themselves be only hypothetical  depending on the
truth of the datum  and  of course  until this is empirically
ascertained  we are as far as ever from empirical reality   venn

formal conditions of mediate inference


  1  a mediate inference is a proposition that depends for proof upon
two or more other propositions  so connected together by one or more
terms  which the evidentiary propositions  or each pair of them  have in
common  as to justify a certain conclusion  namely  the proposition in
question  the type or  more properly  the unit of all such modes of
proof  when of a strictly logical kind  is the syllogism  to which we
shall see that all other modes are reducible  it may be exhibited
symbolically thus 

      m is p 
      s is m 
    ‚à¥ s is p 

syllogisms may be classified  as to quantity  into universal or
particular  according to the quantity of the conclusion  as to quality 
into affirmative or negative  according to the quality of the
conclusion  and  as to relation  into categorical  hypothetical and
disjunctive  according as all their propositions are categorical  or one
 at least  of their evidentiary propositions is a hypothetical or a
disjunctive 

to begin with categorical syllogisms  of which the following is an
example 

      all authors are vain 
      cicero is an author 
    ‚à¥ cicero is vain 

here we may suppose that there are no direct means of knowing that
cicero is vain  but we happen to know that all authors are vain and
that he is an author  and these two propositions  put together 
unmistakably imply that he is vain  in other words  we do not at first
know any relation between  cicero  and  vanity   but we know that these
two terms are severally related to a third term   author   hence called
a middle term  and thus we perceive  by mediate evidence  that they are
related to one another  this sort of proof bears an obvious resemblance
 though the relations involved are not the same  to the mathematical
proof of equality between two quantities  that cannot be directly
compared  by showing the equality of each of them to some third
quantity  a = b = c ‚à¥ a = c  here b is a middle term 

we have to inquire  then  what conditions must be satisfied in order
that a syllogism may be formally conclusive or valid  a specious
syllogism that is not really valid is called a parasyllogism 

  2  general canons of the syllogism 

 1  a syllogism contains three  and no more  distinct propositions 

 2  a syllogism contains three  and no more  distinct univocal terms 

these two canons imply one another  three propositions with less than
three terms can only be connected in some of the modes of immediate
inference  three propositions with more than three terms do not show
that connection of two terms by means of a third  which is requisite for
proving a mediate inference  if we write  

    all authors are vain 
    cicero is a statesman  

there are four terms and no middle term  and therefore there is no
proof  or if we write  

      all authors are vain 
      cicero is an author 
    ‚à¥ cicero is a statesman  

here the term  statesman  occurs without any voucher  it appears in the
inference but not in the evidence  and therefore violates the maxim of
all formal proof   not to go beyond the evidence   it is true that if
any one argued  

      all authors are vain 
      cicero wrote on philosophy 
    ‚à¥ cicero is vain  

this could not be called a bad argument or a material fallacy  but it
would be a needless departure from the form of expression in which the
connection between the evidence and the inference is most easily seen 

still  a mere adherence to the same form of words in the expression of
terms is not enough  we must also attend to their meaning  for if the
same word be used ambiguously  as  author  now for  father  and anon for
 man of letters    it becomes as to its meaning two terms  so that we
have four in all  then  if the ambiguous term be the middle  no
connection is shown between the other two  if either of the others be
ambiguous  something seems to be inferred which has never been really
given in evidence 

the above two canons are  indeed  involved in the definition of a
categorical syllogism  which may be thus stated  a categorical syllogism
is a form of proof or reasoning  way of giving reasons  in which one
categorical proposition is established by comparing two others that
contain together only three terms  or that have one and only one term in
common 

the proposition established  derived  or inferred  is called the
conclusion  the evidentiary propositions by which it is proved are
called the premises 

the term common to the premises  by means of which the other terms are
compared  is called the middle term  the subject of the conclusion is
called the minor term  the predicate of the conclusion  the major term 

the premise in which the minor term occurs is called the minor premise 
that in which the major term occurs is called the major premise  and a
syllogism is usually written thus 

major premise  all authors  middle  are vain  major  

minor premise  cicero  minor  is an author  middle  

conclusion  ‚à¥ cicero  minor  is vain  major  

here we have three propositions with three terms  each term occurring
twice  the minor and major terms are so called  because  when the
conclusion is an universal affirmative  which only occurs in barbara 
see chap  x    6   its subject and predicate are respectively the less
and the greater in extent or denotation  and the premises are called
after the peculiar terms they contain  the expressions  major premise 
and  minor premise  have nothing to do with the order in which the
premises are presented  though it is usual to place the major premise
first 

 3  no term must be distributed in the conclusion unless it is
distributed in the premises 

it is usual to give this as one of the general canons of the syllogism 
but we have seen  chap  vi    6  that it is of wider application 
indeed   not to go beyond the evidence  belongs to the definition of
formal proof  a breech of this rule in a syllogism is the fallacy of
illicit process of the minor  or of the major  according to which term
has been unwarrantably distributed  the following parasyllogism
illicitly distributes both terms of the conclusion 

      all poets are pathetic 
      some orators are not poets 
    ‚à¥ no orators are pathetic 

 4  the middle term must be distributed at least once in the premises
 in order to prove a conclusion in the given terms  

for the use of mediate evidence is to show the relation of terms that
cannot be directly compared  this is only possible if the middle term
furnishes the ground of comparison  and this  in logic  requires that
the whole denotation of the middle should be either included or excluded
by one of the other terms  since if we only know that the other terms
are related to  some  of the middle  their respective relations may not
be with the same part of it 

it is true that in what has been called the  numerically definite
syllogism   an inference may be drawn  though our canon seems to be
violated  thus 

        60 sheep in 100 are horned 
        60 sheep in 100 are blackfaced 
    ‚à¥ at least 20 blackfaced sheep in 100 are horned 

but such an argument  though it may be correct arithmetic  is not logic
at all  and when such numerical evidence is obtainable the comparatively
indefinite arguments of logic are needless  another apparent exception
is the following 

      most men are 5 feet high 
      most men are semi rational 
    ‚à¥ some semi rational things are 5 feet high 

here the middle term  men  is distributed in neither premise  yet the
indisputable conclusion is a logical proposition  the premises  however 
are really arithmetical  for  most  means  more than half   or more than
50 per cent 

still  another apparent exception is entirely logical  suppose we are
given  the premises   all p is m   and  all s is m   the middle term is
undistributed  but take the obverse of the contrapositive of both
premises 

      all m is p 
      all m is s 
    ‚à¥ some s is p 

here we have a conclusion legitimately obtained  but it is not in the
terms originally given 

for mediate inference depending on truly logical premises  then  it is
necessary that one premise should distribute the middle term  and the
reason of this may be illustrated even by the above supposed numerical
exceptions  for in them the premises are such that  though neither of
the two premises by itself distributes the middle  yet they always
overlap upon it  if each premise dealt with exactly half the middle 
thus barely distributing it between them  there would be no logical
proposition inferrible  we require that the middle term  as used in one
premise  should necessarily overlap the same term as used in the other 
so as to furnish common ground for comparing the other terms  hence i
have defined the middle term as  that term common to both premises by
means of which the other terms are compared  

 5  one at least of the premises must be affirmative  or  from two
negative premises nothing can be inferred  in the given terms  

the fourth canon required that the middle term should be given
distributed  or in its whole extent  at least once  in order to afford
sure ground of comparison for the others  but that such comparison may
be effected  something more is requisite  the relation of the other
terms to the middle must be of a certain character  one at least of them
must be  as to its extent or denotation  partially or wholly identified
with the middle  so that to that extent it may be known to bear to the
other term  whatever relation we are told that so much of the middle
bears to that other term  now  identity of denotation can only be
predicated in an affirmative proposition  one premise  then  must be
affirmative 

if both premises are negative  we only know that both the other terms
are partly or wholly excluded from the middle  or are not identical with
it in denotation  where they lie  then  in relation to one another we
have no means of knowing  similarly  in the mediate comparison of
quantities  if we are told that a and c are both of them unequal to b 
we can infer nothing as to the relation of c to a  hence the premises  

    no electors are sober 
    no electors are independent  

however suggestive  do not formally justify us in inferring any
connection between sobriety and independence  formally to draw a
conclusion  we must have affirmative grounds  such as in this case we
may obtain by obverting both premises 

      all electors are not sober 
      all electors are not independent 
    ‚à¥ some who are not independent are not sober 

but this conclusion is not in the given terms 

 6   a  if one premise be negative  the conclusion must be negative  and
 b  to prove a negative conclusion  one premise must be negative 

 a  for we have seen that one premise must be affirmative  and that thus
one term must be partly  at least  identified with the middle  if  then 
the other premise  being negative  predicates the exclusion of the
remaining term from the middle  this remaining term must be excluded
from the first term  so far as we know the first to be identical with
the middle  and this exclusion will be expressed by a negative
conclusion  the analogy of the mediate comparison of quantities may here
again be noticed  if a is equal to b  and b is unequal to c  a is
unequal to c 

 b  if both premises be affirmative  the relations to the middle of both
the other terms are more or less inclusive  and therefore furnish no
ground for an exclusive inference  this also follows from the function
of the middle term 

for the more convenient application of these canons to the testing of
syllogisms  it is usual to derive from them three corollaries 

 i  two particular premises yield no conclusion 

for if both premises be affirmative   all  their terms are
undistributed  the subjects by predesignation  the predicates by
position  and therefore the middle term must be undistributed  and there
can be no conclusion 

if one premise be negative  its predicate is distributed by position 
the other terms remaining undistributed  but  by canon 6  the conclusion
 if any be possible  must be negative  and therefore its predicate  the
major term  will be distributed  in the premises  therefore  both the
middle and the major terms should be distributed  which is impossible 
e g  

      some m is not p 
      some s is m 
    ‚à¥ some s is not p 

here  indeed  the major term is legitimately distributed  though the
negative premise might have been the minor   but m  the middle term  is
distributed in neither premise  and therefore there can be no
conclusion 

still  an exception may be made by admitting a bi designate conclusion 

      some p is m 
      some s is not m 
    ‚à¥ some s is not some p 

 ii  if one premise be particular  so is the conclusion 

for  again  if both premises be affirmative  they only distribute one
term  the subject of the universal premise  and this must be the middle
term  the minor term  therefore  is undistributed  and the conclusion
must be particular 

if one premise be negative  the two premises together can distribute
only two terms  the subject of the universal and the predicate of the
negative  which may be the same premise   one of these terms must be the
middle  the other  since the conclusion is negative  must be the major 
the minor term  therefore  is undistributed  and the conclusion must be
particular 

 iii  from a particular major and a negative minor premise nothing can
be inferred 

for the minor premise being negative  the major premise must be
affirmative  5th canon   and therefore  being particular  distributes
the major term neither in its subject nor in its predicate  but since
the conclusion must be negative  6th canon   a distributed major term is
demanded  e g  

      some m is p 
      no s is m 
    ‚à¥         

here the minor and the middle terms are both distributed  but not the
major  p   and  therefore  a negative conclusion is impossible 

  3  first principle or axiom of the syllogism   hitherto in this
chapter we have been analysing the conditions of valid mediate
inference  we have seen that a single step of such inference  a
syllogism  contains  when fully expressed in language  three
propositions and three terms  and that these terms must stand to one
another in the relations required by the fourth  fifth  and sixth
canons  we now come to a principle which conveniently sums up these
conditions  it is called the  dictum de omni et nullo   and may be
stated thus 

    whatever is predicated  affirmatively or negatively  of a
    term distributed 

    with which term another term can be  partly or wholly 
    identified 

    may be predicated in like manner  affirmatively or
    negatively  of the latter term  or part of it  

thus stated  nearly as by whately in the introduction to his  logic  
the  dictum  follows line by line the course of a syllogism in the first
figure  see chap  x    2   to return to our former example   all authors
are vain  is the same as  vanity is predicated of all authors   cicero
is an author  is the same as  cicero is identified as an author 
therefore  cicero is vain   or  vanity may be predicated of cicero  the
 dictum  then requires   1  three propositions   2  three terms   3 
that the middle term be distributed   4  that one premise be
affirmative  since only by an affirmative proposition can one term be
identified with another   5  that if one premise be negative the
conclusion shall be so too  since whatever is predicated of the middle
term is predicated  in like manner  of the minor 

thus far  then  the  dictum  is wholly analytic or verbal  expressing no
more than is implied in the definitions of  syllogism  and  middle
term   since  as we have seen  all the general canons  except the third 
which is a still more general condition of formal proof  are derivable
from those definitions  however  the  dictum  makes a further statement
of a synthetic or real character  namely  that  when these conditions
are fulfilled an inference is justified   that then the major and minor
terms are brought into comparison through the middle  and that the major
term may be predicated affirmatively or negatively of all or part of the
minor  it is this real assertion that justifies us in calling the
 dictum  an axiom 

  4  whether the laws of thought may not fully explain the syllogism
without the need of any synthetic principle has  however  been made a
question  take such a syllogism as the following 

      all domestic animals are useful 
      all pugs are domestic animals 
    ‚à¥ all pugs are useful 

here  an ingenious man might urge   having once identified pugs with
domestic animals  that they are useful follows from the law of identity 
if we attend to the meaning  and remember that what is true in one form
of words is true in any other form  then  all domestic animals being
useful  of course pugs are  it is merely a case of subalternation  we
may put it in this way 

      all domestic animals are useful 
    ‚à¥ some domestic animals  e g   pugs  are useful 

the derivation of negative syllogisms from the law of contradiction  he
might add  may be shown in a similar manner 

but the force of this ingenious argument depends on the participial
clause   having once identified pugs with domestic animals   if this is
a distinct step of the reasoning  the above syllogism cannot be reduced
to one step  cannot be exhibited as mere subalternation  nor be brought
directly under the law of identity  if  pug    domestic   and  useful 
are distinct terms  and if  pug  and  useful  are only known to be
connected because of their relations to  domestic   this is something
more than the laws of thought provide for  it is not immediate
inference  but mediate  and to justify it  scientific method requires
that its conditions be generalised  the  dictum   then  as we have seen 
does generalise these conditions  and declares that when such conditions
are satisfied a mediate inference is valid 

but  after all  to go back a little   consider again that proposition
 all pugs are domestic animals   is it a distinct step of the reasoning 
that is to say  is it a real proposition  if  indeed   domestic  is no
part of the definition of  pug   the proposition is real  and is a
distinct part of the argument  but take such a case as this 

    all dogs are useful 
    all pugs are dogs 

here we clearly have  in the minor premise  only a verbal proposition 
to be a dog is certainly part of the definition of  pug   but  if so 
the inference  all pugs are useful  involves no real mediation  and the
argument is no more than this 

      all dogs are useful 
    ‚à¥ some dogs  e g   pugs  are useful 

similarly  if the major premise be verbal  thus 

    all men are rational 
    socrates is a man  

to conclude that  socrates is rational  is no mediate inference  for so
much was implied in the minor premise   socrates is a man   and the
major premise adds nothing to this 

hence we may conclude  as anticipated in chap  vii    3  that  any
apparent syllogism  having one premise a verbal proposition  is really
an immediate inference   but that  if both premises are real
propositions  the inference is mediate  and demands for its explanation
something more than the laws of thought 

the fact is that to prove the minor to be a case of the middle term may
be an exceedingly difficult operation  chap  xiii    7   the difficulty
is disguised by ordinary examples  used for the sake of convenience 

  5  other kinds of mediate inference exist  yielding valid conclusions 
without being truly syllogistic  such are mathematical inferences of
equality  as  

    a = b = c ‚à¥ a = c 

here  according to the usual logical analysis  there are strictly four
terms   1  a   2  equal to b   3  b   4  equal to c 

similarly with the argument  a fortiori  

    a   b   c  ‚à¥  much more  a   c 

this also is said to contain four terms   1  a   2  greater than b   3 
b   4  greater than c  such inferences are nevertheless intuitively
sound  may be verified by trial  within the limits of sense perception  
and are generalised in appropriate axioms of their own  corresponding to
the  dictum  of the syllogism  as  things equal to the same thing are
equal to one another   etc 

now  surely  this is an erroneous application of the usual logical
analysis of propositions  both logic and mathematics treat of the
 relations  of terms  but whilst mathematics employs the sign = for only
one kind of relation  and for that relation exclusive of the terms 
logic employs the same signs   is  or  is not   for all relations 
recognising only a difference of quality in predication  and treating
every other difference of relation as belonging to one of the terms
related  thus logicians read  a  is  equal to b   as if  equal to b 
could possibly be a term co relative with a  whence it follows that the
argument  a = b = c ‚à¥ a = c  contains four terms  though everybody sees
that there are only three 

in fact  as observed in chap  ii    2  the sign of logical relation
  is  or  is not    whilst usually adequate for class reasoning
 coinherence  and sometimes extensible to causation  because a cause
implies a class of events   should never be stretched to include other
relations in such a way as to sacrifice intelligence to formalism  and 
besides mathematical or quantitative relations  there are others
 usually considered qualitative because indefinite  which cannot be
justly expressed by the logical copula  we ought to read propositions
expressing time relations  and inferences drawn accordingly  thus 

      b  is before  c 
      a  is before  b 
    ‚à¥ a  is before  c 

and in like manner  a  is simultaneous with  b  etc   such arguments  as
well as the mathematical  are intuitively sound and verifiable  and
might be generalised in axioms if it were worth while  but it is not 
because no method could be founded on such axioms 

the customary use of relative terms justifies some mediate inferences 
as   the father of a father is a grand father  

some cases  however  that at first seem obvious  are really delusive
unless further data be supplied  thus  a co exists with b  b with c  ‚à¥ a
with c   is not sound unless  b  is an instantaneous event  for where b
is perdurable   a  may co exist with it at one time and  c  at another 

again   a is to the left of b  b of c  ‚à¥ a of c   this may pass  but it
is not a parallel argument that if  a is north of b and b west of c  
then  a is north west of c   for suppose that a is a mile to the north
of b  and b a yard to the west of c  then a is practically north of c 
at least  its westward position cannot be expressed in terms of the
mariner s compass  in such a case we require to know not only the
directions but the distances of a and c from b  and then the exact
direction of a from c is an affair of mathematical calculation 

qualitative reasoning concerning position is only applicable to things
in one dimension of space  or in time considered as having one
dimension  under these conditions we may frame the following
generalisation concerning all mediate inferences  two terms definitely
related to a third  and one of them positively  are related to one
another as the other term is related to the third  that is  positively
or negatively   provided that the relations given are of the same kind
 that is  of time  or coinherence  or likeness  or equality  

thus  to illustrate by relations of time  

      b is simultaneous with c 
      a is not simultaneous with b 
    ‚à¥ a is not simultaneous with c 

here the relations are of the same kind but of different logical
quality  and  as in the syllogism  a negative copula in the premises
leads to a negative conclusion 

an examination in detail of particular cases would show that the above
generalisation concerning all mediate inferences is subject to too many
qualifications to be called an axiom  it stands to the real axioms  the
 dictum   etc   as the notion of the uniformity of nature does to the
definite principles of natural order   cf   chap  xiii    9  




chapter x

categorical syllogisms


  1  the type of logical  deductive  mediate  categorical inference is a
syllogism directly conformable with the  dictum   as  

      all carnivores  m  are excitable  p  
      cats  s  are carnivores  m  
    ‚à¥ cats  s  are excitable  p  

in this example p is predicated of m  a term distributed  in which term 
m  s is given as included  so that p may be predicated of s 

many arguments  however  are of a type superficially different from the
above  as  

      no wise man  p  fears death  m  
      balbus  s  fears death  m  
    ‚à¥ balbus  s  is not a wise man  p  

in this example  instead of p being predicated of m  m is predicated of
p  and yet s is given as included not in p  but in m  the divergence of
such a syllogism from the  dictum  may  however  be easily shown to be
superficial by writing  instead of  no wise man fears death   the
simple  converse   no man who fears death is wise  

again 

      some dogs  m  are friendly to man  p  
      all dogs  m  are carnivores  s  
    ‚à¥ some carnivores  s  are friendly to man  p  

here p is predicated of m undistributed  and instead of s being included
in m  m is included in s  so that the divergence from the type of
syllogism to which the  dictum  directly applies is still greater than
in the former case  but if we transpose the premises  taking first

    all dogs  m  are carnivores  p  

then p is predicated of m distributed  and  simply converting the other
premise  we get  

    some things friendly to man  s  are dogs  m  

whence it follows that  

    some things friendly to man  s  are carnivores  p  

and this is the simple converse of the original conclusion 

once more 

      no pigs  p  are philosophers  m  
      some philosophers  m  are hedonists  s  
    ‚à¥ some hedonists  s  are not pigs  p  

in this case  instead of p being predicated of m distributed  m is
predicated of p distributed  and instead of s  or part of it  being
included in m  we are told that some m is included in s  still there is
no real difficulty  simply convert both the premises  and we have 

    no philosophers  m  are pigs  p  
    some hedonists  s  are philosophers  m  

whence the same conclusion follows  and the whole syllogism plainly
conforms directly to the  dictum  

such departures as these from the normal syllogistic form are said to
constitute differences of figure  see   2   and the processes by which
they are shown to be unessential differences are called reduction  see  
6  

  2  figure is determined by the position of the middle term in the
premises  of which position there are four possible variations  the
middle term may be subject of the major premise  and predicate of the
minor  as in the first example above  and this position  being directly
conformable to the requirements of the  dictum   is called the first
figure  or the middle term may be predicate of both premises  as in the
second of the above examples  and this is called the second figure  or
the middle term may be subject of both premises  as in the third of the
above examples  and this is called the third figure  or  finally  the
middle term may be predicate of the major premise  and subject of the
minor  as in the fourth example given above  and this is the fourth
figure 

it may facilitate the recollection of this most important point if we
schematise the figures thus 

  i              ii                 iii               iv 

m   p          p   m               m   p             p   m
                  |                 |                   /
                  |                 |                  /
                  |                 |                 /
s   m          s   m               m   s             m   s

the horizontal lines represent the premises  and at the angles formed
with them by the slanting or by the perpendicular lines the middle term
occurs  the schema of figure iv  resembles z  the last letter of the
alphabet  this helps one to remember it in contrast with figure i  
which is thereby also remembered  figures ii  and iii  seem to stand
back to back 

  3  the moods of each figure are the modifications of it which arise
from different combinations of propositions according to quantity and
quality  in figure i   for example  four moods are recognised  a a a  
e a e   a i i   e i o 

    a   all m is p 
    a   all s is m 
    a   ‚à¥ all s is p 

    e   no m is p 
    a   all s is m 
    e   ‚à¥ no s is p 

    a   all m is p 
    i   some s is m 
    i   ‚à¥ some s is p 

    e   no m is p 
    i   some s is m 
    o   ‚à¥ some s is not p 

now  remembering that there are four figures  and four kinds of
propositions  a  i  e  o    each of which propositions may be major
premise  minor premise  or conclusion of a syllogism  it appears that in
each figure there may be 64 moods  and therefore 256 in all  on
examining these 256 moods  however  we find that only 24 of them are
valid  i e   of such a character that the conclusion strictly follows
from the premises   whilst 5 of these 24 are needless  because their
conclusions are  weaker  or less extensive than the premises warrant 
that is to say  they are particular when they might be universal  thus 
in figure i   besides the above 4 moods  a a i  and e a o  are valid in
the sense of being conclusive  but they are superfluous  because
included in a a a  and e a e  omitting  then  these 5 needless moods 
which are called  subalterns  because their conclusions are subaltern
 chap  vii    2  to those of other moods  there remain 19 moods that are
valid and generally recognised 

  4  how these 19 moods are determined must be our next inquiry  there
are several ways more or less ingenious and interesting  but all depend
on the application  directly or indirectly  of the six canons  which
were shown in the last chapter to be the conditions of mediate
inference 

 1  one way is to begin by finding what moods of figure i  conform to
the  dictum   now  the  dictum  requires that  in the major premise  p
be predicated of a term distributed  from which it follows that no mood
can be valid whose major premise is particular  as in i a i  or o a o 
again  the  dictum  requires that the minor premise be affirmative
  with which term another is identified    so that no mood can be valid
whose minor premise is negative  as in a e e  or a o o  by such
considerations we find that in figure i   out of 64 moods possible  only
six are valid  namely  those above mentioned in   3  including the two
subalterns  the second step of this method is to test the moods of the
second  third  and fourth figures  by trying whether they can be reduced
to one or other of the four moods of the first  as briefly illustrated
in   1  and to be further explained in   6  

 2  another way is to take the above six general or common canons  and
to deduce from them special canons for testing each figure  an
interesting method  which  on account of its length  will be treated of
separately in the next section 

 3  direct application of the common canons is  perhaps  the simplest
plan  first write out the 64 moods that are possible without regard to
figure  and then cross out those which violate any of the canons or
corollaries  thus

  a o a   6th can  a    a o e   cor  ii     a o i   6th can  a  aoo 

whoever has the patience to go through the remaining 48 moods will
discover that of the whole 64 only 11 are valid  namely 

a a a   a a i   a e e   a e o   a i i   a o o  
e a e   e a o   e i o   i a i   o a o 

these 11 moods have next to be examined in each figure  and if valid in
every figure there will still be 44 moods in all  we find  however  that
in the first figure  a e e   a e o   a o o  involve illicit process of
the major term  3rd can    i a i   o a o  involve undistributed middle
 4th can    and a a i   e a o  are subalterns  in the second figure all
the affirmative moods  a a a   a a i   a i i   i a i   involve
undistributed middle  o a o  gives illicit process of the major term 
and a e o   e a o  are subalterns  in the third figure  a a a   e a e  
involve illicit process of the minor term  3rd can    a e e   a e o  
a o o   illicit process of the major term  in the fourth figure  a a a 
and e a e  involve illicit process of the minor term  a i i   a o o  
undistributed middle  o a o  involves illicit process of the major term 
and a e o  is subaltern 

those moods of each figure which  when tried by these tests  are not
rejected  are valid  namely 

fig  i   a a a   e a e   a i i   e i o   a a i   e a o   subaltern  

fig  ii   e a e   a e e   e i o   a o o   e a o   a e o   subaltern  

fig  iii   a a i   i a i   a i i   e a o   o a o   e i o  

fig  iv   a a i   a e e   i a i   e a o   e i o   a e o   subaltern  

thus  including subaltern moods  there are six valid in each figure  in
fig  iii  alone there is no subaltern mood  because in that figure there
can be no universal conclusion 

  5  special canons of the several figures  deduced from the common
canons  enable us to arrive at the same result by a somewhat different
course  they are not  perhaps  necessary to the science  but afford a
very useful means of enabling one to thoroughly appreciate the character
of formal syllogistic reasoning  accordingly  the proof of each rule
will be indicated  and its elaboration left to the reader  there is no
difficulty  if one bears in mind that figure is determined by the
position of the middle term 

fig  i   rule  a    the minor premise must be affirmative  

for  if not  in negative moods there will be illicit process of the
major term  applying this rule to the eleven possible moods given in  
4  as remaining after application of the common canons  it eliminates
a e e   a e o   a o o 

 b   the major premise must be universal  

for  if not  the minor premise being affirmative  the middle term will
be undistributed  this rule eliminates i a i   o a o   leaving six
moods  including two subalterns 

fig  ii   a   one premise must be negative  

for else neither premise will distribute the middle term  this rule
eliminates a a a   a a i   a i i   i a i 

 b   the major premise must be universal  

for else  the conclusion being negative  there will be illicit process
of the major term  this eliminates i a i   o a o   leaving six moods 
including two subalterns 

fig  iii   a   the minor premise must be affirmative  

for else  in negative moods there will be illicit process of the major
term  this rule eliminates a e e   a e o   a o o 

 b   the conclusion must be particular  

for  if not  the minor premise being affirmative  there will be illicit
process of the minor term  this eliminates a a a   a e e   e a e  
leaving six moods 

fig  iv   a   when the major premise is affirmative  the minor must be
universal  

for else the middle term is undistributed  this eliminates a i i  
a o o 

 b   when the minor premise is affirmative the conclusion must be
particular  

otherwise there will be illicit process of the minor term  this
eliminates a a a   e a e 

 c   when either premise is negative  the major must be universal  

for else  the conclusion being negative  there will be illicit process
of the major term  this eliminates o a o   leaving six moods  including
one subaltern 

  6  reduction is either   1  ostensive or  2  indirect  ostensive
reduction consists in showing that an argument given in one mood can
also be stated in another  the process is especially used to show that
the moods of the second  third  and fourth figures are equivalent to one
or another mood of the first figure  it thus proves the validity of the
former moods by showing that they also essentially conform to the
 dictum   and that all categorical syllogisms are only superficial
varieties of one type of proof 

to facilitate reduction  the recognised moods have all had names given
them  which names  again  have been strung together into mnemonic verses
of great force and pregnancy 

    barbara  celarent  darii  ferioque prioris 
    cesare  camestres  festino  baroco  secund√¶ 
    tertia  darapti  disamis  datisi  felapton 
    bocardo  ferison  habet  quarta insuper addit
    bramantip  camenes  dimaris  fesapo  fresison 

in the above verses the names of the moods of fig  i  begin with the
first four consonants b  c  d  f  in alphabetical order  and the names
of all other moods likewise begin with these letters  thus signifying
 except in baroco and bocardo  the mood of fig  i   to which each is
equivalent  and to which it is to be reduced  as bramantip to barbara 
camestres to celarent  and so forth 

the vowels a  e  i  o  occurring in the several names  give the quantity
and quality of major premise  minor premise  and conclusion in the usual
order 

the consonants s and p  occurring after a vowel  show that the
proposition which the vowel stands for is to be converted either  s 
simply or  p   per accidens   except where s or p occurs after the third
vowel of a name  the conclusion  then it refers not to the conclusion of
the given mood  say disamis   but to the conclusion of that mood of the
first figure to which the given mood is reduced  darii  

m   mutare   metathesis  means  transpose the premises   as of
ca m estres  

c means  substitute the contradictory of the conclusion for the
foregoing premise   a process of the indirect reduction to be presently
explained  see baroco    8  

the other consonants  r  n  t  with b and d  when not initial  
occurring here and there  have no mnemonic significance 

what now is the problem of reduction  the difference of figures depends
upon the position of the middle term  to reduce a mood of any other
figure to the form of the first  then  we must so manipulate its
premises that the middle term shall be subject of the major premise and
predicate of the minor premise 

now in fig  ii  the middle term is predicate of both premises  so that
the minor premise may need no alteration  and to convert the major
premise may suffice  this is the case with cesare  which reduces to
celarent by simply converting the major premise  and with festino  which
by the same process becomes ferio  in camestres  however  the minor
premise is negative  and  as this is impossible in fig  i   the premises
must be transposed  and the new major premise must be simply converted 
then  since the transposition of the premises will have transposed the
terms of the conclusion  according to the usual reading of syllogisms  
the new conclusion must be simply converted in order to prove the
validity of the original conclusion  the process may be thus represented
  s c   meaning  simply convert  

  camestres                celarent 

  all p is m           /     no m is s 
                     c/
                     /
                   s/ 
                   /   
  no s is m       /          all p is m 

                  s c 
‚à¥ no s is p   <            no p is s 

the ostensive reduction of baroco also needs special explanation  for as
it used to be reduced indirectly  its name gives no indication of the
ostensive process  to reduce it ostensively let us call it faksnoko 
where k means  obvert the foregoing premise   by thus obverting  k  and
simply converting  s   in sum  contrapositing  the major premise  and
obverting the minor premise  we get a syllogism in ferio  thus 

baroco or faksnoko                                   ferio 
                            contrap 
    all p is m                                  no m  not m  is p 

                              obv 
    some s is not m                             some s is m  not m  
  ‚à¥ some s is not p                             ‚à¥ some s is not p 

in fig  iii  the middle term is subject of both premises  so that  to
reduce its moods to the first figure  it may be enough to convert the
minor premise  this is the case with darapti  datisi  felapton  and
ferison  but  with disamis  since the major premise must in the first
figure be universal  we must transpose the premises  and then simply
convert the new minor premise  and  lastly  since the major and minor
terms have now changed places  we must simply convert the new conclusion
in order to verify the old one  thus 

      disamis                       darii 

    some m is p           /     all m is s 
                       s /
                        /
                       / c 
                      /   
    all m is s       /          some p is m 

                      s c 
‚à¥ some s is p  <              ‚à¥ some p is s 

bocardo  like baroco  indicates by its name the indirect process  to
reduce it ostensively let its name be doksamrosk  and proceed thus 

  bocardo or doksamrosk                             darii 

    some m is not p                 /           all m is s 
                                   /
                                  /
                                 /   contrap 
                                /   
    all m is s                 /                some p  not p  is m 

                        convert & obvert 
‚à¥ some s is not p  <                          ‚à¥ some p  not p  is s 

in fig  iv  the position of the middle term is  in both premises  the
reverse of what it is in the first figure  we may therefore reduce its
moods either by transposing the premises  as with bramantip  camenes 
and dimaris  or by converting both premises  the course pursued with
fesapo and fresison  it may suffice to illustrate by the case of
bramantip 

bramantip                                  barbara 

all p is m                    /          all m is s 
                             /
                            / 
all m is s                 /             all p is m 

                      convert per acc 
‚à¥ some s is p    <                        ‚à¥ all p is s 

this case shows that a final significant consonant  s  p  or sk  in the
name of any mood refers to the conclusion of the new syllogism in the
first figure  since p in bramantip cannot refer to that mood s own
conclusion in i   which  being already particular  cannot be converted
 per accidens  

finally  in fig  i   darii and ferio differ respectively from barbara
and celarent only in this  that their minor premises  and consequently
their conclusions  are subaltern to the corresponding propositions of
the universal moods  a difference which seems insufficient to give them
rank as distinct forms of demonstration  and as for barbara and
celarent  they are easily reducible to one another by obverting their
major premises and the new conclusions  thus 

barbara                                      celarent 
                         obv 
all m is p                                 no m is p  not p  

all s is m                                 all s is m 

                          obv 
‚à¥ all s is p     <                       ‚à¥ no s is p  not p  

there is  then  only one fundamental syllogism 

  7  a new version of the mnemonic lines was suggested in  mind  no  27 
with the object of  1  freeing them from all meaningless letters   2 
showing by the name of each mood the figure to which it belongs   3 
giving names to indicate the ostensive reduction of baroco and bocardo 
to obtain the first two objects   l  is used as the mark of fig  i    n 
of fig ii    r  of fig  iii    t  of fig  iv  the verses  to be scanned
discreetly  are as follows 

balala  celalel  dalii  felioque prioris 

                           faksnoko 
cesane  camenes  fesinon             secund√¶ 
                            banoco  

tertia  darapri  drisamis  darisi  ferapro 

doksamrosk 
             ferisor habet  quarta insuper addit 
bocaro     

bamatip  cametes  dimatis  fesapto  fesistot 

de morgan praised the old verses as  more full of meaning than any
others that ever were made   and in defence of the above alteration it
may be said that they now deserve that praise still more 

  8  indirect reduction is the process of proving a mood to be valid by
showing that the supposition of its invalidity involves a contradiction 
take baroco  and  since the doubt as to its validity is concerned not
with the truth of the premises  but with their relation to the
conclusion  assume the premises to be true  then  if the conclusion be
false  its contradictory is true  the conclusion being in o   its
contradictory will be in a  substituting this a  for the minor premise
of baroco  we have the premises of a syllogism in barbara  which will be
found to give a conclusion in a   contradictory of the original minor
premise  thus 

     baroco                            barbara 

  all p is m                          all p is m 

  some s is not m  <          /       all s is p 
                             /
             contradictory  /
                           /  contradictory
                          /   
‚à¥ some s is not p        /            ‚à¥ all s is m 

but the original minor premise   some s is not m   is true by
hypothesis  and therefore the conclusion of barbara   all s is m   is
false  this falsity cannot  however  be due to the form of barbara 
which we know to be valid  nor to the major premise  which  being taken
from baroco  is true by hypothesis  it must  therefore  lie in the minor
premise of barbara   all s is p   and since this is contradictory of the
conclusion of baroco  some s is not p   that conclusion was true 

similarly  with bocardo  the indirect reduction proceeds by substituting
for the major premise the contradictory of the conclusion  thus again
obtaining the premises of a syllogism in barbara  whose conclusion is
contradictory of the original major premise  hence the initial b in
baroco and bocardo  it points to a syllogism in barbara as the means of
indirect reduction   reductio ad impossibile   

any other mood may be reduced indirectly  as  for example  dimaris  if
this is supposed to be invalid and the conclusion false  substitute the
contradictory of the conclusion for the major premise  thus obtaining
the premises of celarent 

dimaris                                        celarent 

                contradictory
some p is m        <                            no s is p 
                                /
                               /
all m is s                    /                 all m is s 
                             /   
               contradictory/     
‚à¥ some s is p                             ‚à¥ no m is p 
                                                       simply converted
                                          ‚à¥ no p is m 

the conclusion of celarent  simply converted  contradicts the original
major premise of dimaris  and is therefore false  therefore the major
premise of celarent is false  and the conclusion of dimaris is true  we
might  of course  construct mnemonic names for the indirect reduction of
all the moods  the name of dimaris would then be cicari 

  9  the need or use of any figure but the first has been much discussed
by logicians  since  in actual debate  arguments are rarely stated in
syllogistic form  and  therefore  if reduced to that form for closer
scrutiny  generally have to be treated with some freedom  why not always
throw them at once into the first figure  that figure has manifest
advantages  it agrees directly with the  dictum   it gives conclusions
in all four propositional forms  and therefore serves every purpose of
full affirmation or denial  of showing agreement or difference  total or
partial   of establishing the contradictories of universal statements 
and it is the only figure in which the subject and predicate of the
conclusion occupy the same positions in the premises  so that the course
of argument has in its mere expression an easy and natural flow 

still  the second figure also has a very natural air in some kinds of
negative arguments  the parallelism of the two premises  with the middle
term as predicate in both  brings out very forcibly the necessary
difference between the major and minor terms that is involved in their
opposite relations to the middle term   p is not  whilst s is  m   says
cesare  that drives home the conviction that  s is not p   similarly in
camestres   deer do  oxen do not  shed their horns   what is the
conclusion 

the third figure  again  furnishes in darapti and felapton  the most
natural forms of stating arguments in which the middle term is singular 

      socrates was truthful 
      socrates was a greek 
    ‚à¥ some greek was truthful 

reducing this to fig i   we should get for the minor premise   some
greek was socrates   which is certainly inelegant  still  it might be
urged that  in relation to proof  elegance is an extraneous
consideration  and as for the other advantage claimed for fig 
iii   that  as it yields only particular conclusions  it is useful in
establishing contradictories against universals  for that purpose none
of its moods can be better than darii or ferio 

as for fig  iv   no particular advantage has been claimed for it  it is
of comparatively late recognition  sometimes called the  galenian  
after galen  its supposed discoverer   and its scientific claim to exist
at all is disputed  it is said to be a mere inversion of fig  i   which
is not true in any sense in which figs  ii  and iii  may not be
condemned as partial inversions of fig  i   and as having therefore
still less claim to recognition  it is also said to invert the order of
thought  as if thought had only one order  or as if the order of thought
had anything to do with formal logic  surely  if distinction of figure
be recognised at all  the fourth figure is scientifically necessary 
because it is inevitably generated by an analysis of the possible
positions of the middle term 

  10  is reduction necessary  however  or have not all the figures equal
and independent validity  in one sense not only every figure but each
mood has independent validity  for any one capable of abstract thinking
sees its validity by direct inspection  and this is true not only of the
abstract moods  but very frequently of particular concrete arguments 
but science aims at unifying knowledge  and after reducing all possible
arguments that form categorical syllogisms to the nineteen moods  it is
another step in the same direction to reduce these moods to one form 
this is the very nature of science  and  accordingly  the efforts of
some logicians to expound separate principles of each figure seem to be
supererogatory  grant that they succeed  and what can the next step be 
but either to reduce these principles to the  dictum   or the  dictum 
and the rest to one of these principles  unless this can be done there
is no science of formal logic  if it is done  what is gained by reducing
the principles of the other figures to the  dictum   instead of the
moods of the other figures to those of the first figure  it may 
perhaps  be said that to show  1  that the moods of the second  third 
and fourth figures flow from their own principles  though  in fact 
these principles are laboriously adapted to the moods   and  2  that
these principles may be derived from the  dictum   is the more
uncompromisingly gradual and regular method  but is not formal logic
already sufficiently encumbered with formalities 

  11  euler s diagrams are used to illustrate the syllogism  though not
very satisfactorily  thus 

barbara  

 illustration  fig  5  

celarent  

 illustration  fig  6  

darii  

 illustration  fig  7  

remembering that  some  means  it may be all   it is plain that any one
of these diagrams in fig  7  or the one given above for barbara  may
represent the denotative relations of p  m and s in darii  though no
doubt the diagram we generally think of as representing darii is no  1
in fig  7 

remembering that a may be u  and that  therefore  wherever a occurs
there may be only one circle for s and p  these syllogisms may be
represented by only two circles  and barbara by only one 

ferio  

 illustration  fig  8  

here  again  probably  we generally think of no  1 as the diagram
representing ferio  but 2  or 3  or that given above for celarent  is
compatible with the premises 

if instead of dealing with m  p  and s  a concrete example be taken of
darii or ferio  a knowledge of the facts of the case will show what
diagram is suitable to it  but  then  surely it must be possible to do
without the diagram  these diagrams  of course  can be used to
illustrate moods of the other figures 




chapter xi

abbreviated and compound arguments


  1  in ordinary discussion  whether oral or written  it is but rarely
that the forms of logic are closely adhered to  we often leave wide gaps
in the structure of our arguments  trusting the intelligence of those
addressed to bridge them over  or we invert the regular order of
propositions  beginning with the conclusion  and mentioning the
premises  perhaps  a good while after  confident that the sagacity of
our audience will make all smooth  sometimes a full style  like
macaulay s  may  by means of amplification and illustration  spread the
elements of a single syllogism over several pages  a pennyworth of logic
steeped in so much eloquence  these practices give a great advantage to
sophists  who would find it very inconvenient to state explicitly in
mood and figure the pretentious antilogies which they foist upon the
public  and  indeed  such licences of composition often prevent honest
men from detecting errors into which they themselves have unwittingly
fallen  and which  with the best intentions  they strive to communicate
to others  but we put up with these drawbacks to avoid the inelegance
and the tedium of a long discourse in accurate syllogisms 

many departures from the strictly logical statement of reasonings
consist in the use of vague or figurative language  or in the
substitution for one another of expressions supposed to be equivalent 
though  in fact  dangerously discrepant  against such occasions of error
the logician can provide no safeguard  except the advice to be careful
and discriminating in what you say or hear  but as to any derangement
of the elements of an argument  or the omission of them  logic
effectually aids the task of restoration  for it has shown what the
elements are that enter into the explicit statement of most
ratiocinations  namely  the four forms of propositions and what that
connected order of propositions is which most easily and surely exposes
the validity or invalidity of reasoning  namely  the premises and
conclusion of the syllogism  logic has even gone so far as to name
certain abbreviated forms of proof  which may be regarded as general
types of those that actually occur in debate  in leading articles 
pamphlets and other persuasive or polemic writings  namely  the
enthymeme  epicheirema and sorites 

  2  the enthymeme  according to aristotle  is the syllogism of probable
reasoning about practical affairs and matters of opinion  in contrast
with the syllogism of theoretical demonstration upon necessary grounds 
but  as now commonly treated  it is an argument with one of its elements
omitted  a categorical syllogism  having one or other of its premises 
or else its conclusion  suppressed  if the major premise be suppressed 
it is called an enthymeme of the first order  if the minor premise be
wanting  it is said to be of the second order  if the conclusion be left
to be understood  there is an enthymeme of the third order 

let the following be a complete syllogism 

     all free nations are enterprising 
     the dutch are a free nation 
   ‚à¥ the dutch are enterprising 

reduced to enthymemes  this argument may be put thus 

in the first order 

      the dutch are a free nation 
    ‚à¥ the dutch are enterprising 

in the second order  

      all free nations are enterprising 
    ‚à¥ the dutch are enterprising 

in the third order  

    all free nations are enterprising 
    and the dutch are a free nation 

it is certainly very common to meet with arguments whose statement may
be represented by one or other of these three forms  indeed  the
enthymeme is the natural substitute for a full syllogism in oratory 
whence the transition from aristotle s to the modern meaning of the
term  the most unschooled of men readily apprehend its force  and a
student of logic can easily supply the proposition that may be wanted in
any case to complete a syllogism  and thereby test the argument s formal
validity  in any enthymeme of the third order  especially  to supply the
conclusion cannot present any difficulty at all  and hence it is a
favourite vehicle of innuendo  as in hamilton s example 

    every liar is a coward 
    and caius is a liar 

the frankness of this statement and its reticence  together  make it a
biting sarcasm upon caius 

the process of finding the missing premise in an enthymeme of either the
first or the second order  so as to constitute a syllogism  is sometimes
called reduction  and for this a simple rule may be given  take that
term of the given premise which does not occur in the conclusion  and
which must therefore be the middle   and combine it with that term of
the conclusion which does not occur in the given premise  the
proposition thus formed is the premise which was requisite to complete
the syllogism  if the premise thus constituted contain the predicate of
the conclusion  the enthymeme was of the first order  if it contain the
subject of the conclusion  the enthymeme was of the second order 

that a statement in the form of a hypothetical proposition may really be
an enthymeme  as observed in chap  v    4  can easily be shown by
recasting one of the above enthymemes thus   if all free nations are
enterprising  the dutch are enterprising   such statements should be
treated according to their true nature 

to reduce the argument of any ordinary discourse to logical form  the
first care should be to make it clear to oneself what exactly the
conclusion is  and to state it adequately but as succinctly as possible 
then look for the evidence  this may be of an inductive character 
consisting of instances  examples  analogies  and  if so  of course its
cogency must be evaluated by the principles of induction  which we
shall presently investigate  but if the evidence be deductive  it will
probably consist of an enthymeme  or of several enthymemes one depending
on another  each enthymeme may be isolated and expanded into a
syllogism  and we may then inquire   1  whether the syllogisms are
formally correct according to barbara  or whatever the appropriate
mood    2  whether the premises  or the ultimate premises  are true in
fact 

  3  a monosyllogism is a syllogism considered as standing alone or
without relation to other arguments  but  of course  a disputant may be
asking to prove the premises of any syllogism  in which case other
syllogisms may be advanced for that purpose  when the conclusion of one
syllogism is used to prove another  we have a chain argument which 
stated at full length  is a polysyllogism  in any polysyllogism  again 
a syllogism whose conclusion is used as the premise of another  is
called in relation to that other a prosyllogism  whilst a syllogism one
of whose premises is the conclusion of another syllogism  is in relation
to that other an episyllogism  two modes of abbreviating a
polysyllogism  are usually discussed  the epicheirema and the sorites 

  4  an epicheirema is a syllogism for one or both of whose premises a
reason is added  as  

      all men are mortal  for they are animals 
      socrates is a man  for rational bipeds are men 
    ‚à¥ socrates is mortal 

the epicheirema is called single or double  says hamilton  according as
an  adscititious proposition  attaches to one or both of the premises 
the above example is of the double kind  the single epicheirema is said
to be of the first order  if the adscititious proposition attach to the
major premise  if to the minor  of the second order   hamilton s
 logic   lecture xix  

an epicheirema  then  is an abbreviated chain of reasoning  or
polysyllogism  comprising an episyllogism with one or two enthymematic
prosyllogisms  the major premise in the above case   all men are mortal 
for they are animals   is an enthymeme of the first order  suppressing
its own major premise  and may be restored thus 

      all animals are mortal 
      all men are animals 
    ‚à¥ all men are mortal 

the minor premise   socrates is a man  for rational bipeds are men   is
an enthymeme of the second order  suppressing its own minor premise  and
may be restored thus 

      all rational bipeds are men 
      socrates is a rational biped 
    ‚à¥ socrates is a man 

  5  the sorites is a polysyllogism in which the conclusions  and even
some of the premises  are suppressed until the arguments end  if the
chain of arguments were freed of its enthymematic character  the
suppressed conclusions would appear as premises of episyllogisms 

two varieties of sorites are recognised  the aristotelian  so called 
though not treated of by aristotle   and the goclenian  named after its
discoverer  goclenius of marburg  who flourished about 1600 a d    in
order to compare these two forms of argument  it will be convenient to
place side by side hamilton s classical examples of them 

          aristotelian                      goclenian 
      bucephalus is a horse           an animal is a substance 
      a horse is a quadruped          a quadruped is an animal 
      a quadruped is an animal        a horse is a quadruped 
      an animal is a substance        bucephalus is a horse 
    ‚à¥ bucephalus is a substance     ‚à¥ bucephalus is a substance 

the reader wonders what is the difference between these two forms  in
the aristotelian sorites the minor term occurs in the first premise  and
the major term in the last  whilst in the goclenian the major term
occurs in the first premise  and the minor in the last  but since the
character of premises is fixed by their terms  not by the order in which
they are written  there cannot be a better example of a distinction
without a difference  at a first glance  indeed  there may seem to be a
more important point involved  the premises of the aristotelian sorites
seem to proceed in the order of fig  iv  but if that were really so the
conclusion would be   some substance is bucephalus   that  on the
contrary  every one writes the conclusion   bucephalus is a substance  
proves that the logical order of the premises is in fig  i  logically 
therefore  there is absolutely no difference between these two forms 
and pure reason requires either that the  aristotelian sorites 
disappear from the text books  or that it be regarded as in fig  iv  
and its conclusion converted  it is the shining merit of goclenius to
have restored the premises of the sorites to the usual order of fig  i  
whereby he has raised to himself a monument more durable than brass  and
secured indeed the very cheapest immortality 

the common sorites  then  being in fig  i   its rules follow from those
of fig  i 

 1  only one premise can be particular  and  if any  only that in which
the minor term occurs 

for  just as in fig i   a particular premise anywhere else involves
undistributed middle 

 2  only one premise can be negative  and  if any  only that in which
the major term occurs 

for if there were two negative premises  at the point where the second
entered the chain of argument there must be a syllogism with two
negative premises  which is contrary to rule 5  whilst if one premise be
negative it must be that which contains the major term  for the same
reason as in fig  i   namely  that the conclusion will be negative  and
that therefore only a negative major premise can prevent illicit process
of the major term 

if we expand a sorites into its constituent syllogisms  the conclusions
successively suppressed will reappear as major premises  thus 

     1  an animal is a substance 
        a quadruped is an animal 
      ‚à¥ a quadruped is a substance 

     2  a quadruped is a substance 
        a horse is a quadruped 
      ‚à¥ a horse is a substance 

     3  a horse is a substance 
        bucephalus is a horse 
      ‚à¥ bucephalus is a substance 

this suffices to show that the protosyllogism of a goclenian sorites is
an enthymeme of the third order  after which the argument is a chain of
enthymemes of the first order  or of the first and third combined  since
the conclusions as well as the major premises are omitted  except in the
last one 

lest it should be thought that the sorites is only good for arguments so
frivolous as the above  i subjoin an example collected from various
parts of mill s  political economy    

      the cost of labour depends on the efficiency of labour 
      the rate of profits depends on the cost of labour 
      the investment of capital depends on the rate of profits 
      wages depend on the investment of capital 
    ‚à¥ wages depend on the efficiency of labour 

had it occurred to mill to construct this sorites  he would have
modified his doctrine of the wages fund  and would have spared many
critics the malignant joy of refuting him 

  6  the antinomy is a combination of arguments by which contradictory
attributes are proved to be predicable of the same subject  in symbols 
thus 

      all m is p              all n is p 
      all s is m              all s is n 
    ‚à¥ all s is p            ‚à¥ all s is p 

now  by the principle of contradiction  s cannot be p and p  not p  
therefore  if both of the above syllogisms are sound  s  as the subject
of contradictory attributes  is logically an impossible thing  the
contradictory conclusions are called  respectively  thesis and
antithesis 

to come to particulars  we may argue   1  that a constitution which is
at once a monarchy  an aristocracy and a democracy  must comprise the
best elements of all three forms  and must  therefore  be the best of
all forms of government  the british constitution is  therefore  the
best of all  but  2  such a constitution must also comprise the worst
elements of monarchy  aristocracy and democracy  and  therefore  must be
the worst of all forms  are we  then  driven to conclude that the
british constitution  thus proved to be both the best and worst  does
not really exist at all  being logically impossible  the proofs seem
equally cogent  but perhaps neither the best nor the worst elements of
the simpler constitutions need be present in our own in sufficient force
to make it either good or bad 

again 

     1  every being who is responsible for his actions is free 
        man is responsible for his actions 
      ‚à¥ man is free 

     2  every being whose actions enter into the course of nature is not free 
        man is such a being 
      ‚à¥ man is not free 

does it  then  follow that  man   as the subject of contradictory
attributes  is a nonentity  this doctrine  or something like it  has
been seriously entertained  but if to any reader it seem extravagant  as
it certainly does to me   he will no doubt find an error in the above
arguments  perhaps the major term is ambiguous 

for other examples it is enough to refer to the  critique of pure
reason   where kant sets out the antinomies of rational cosmology  but
even if we do not agree with kant that the human understanding  in
attempting to deal with certain subjects beyond its reach  inevitably
falls into such contradictory reasonings  yet it can hardly be doubted
that we not unfrequently hold opinions which  if logically developed 
result in antinomies  and  accordingly  the antinomy  if it cannot be
imputed to reason herself  may be a very fair  and a very wholesome
 argumentum ad hominem   it was the favourite weapon of the pyrrhonists
against the dogmatic philosophies that flourished after the death of
aristotle 




chapter xii

conditional syllogisms


  1  conditional syllogisms may be generally described as those that
contain conditional propositions  they are usually divided into two
classes  hypothetical and disjunctive 

a hypothetical syllogism is one that consists of a hypothetical major
premise  a categorical minor premise  and a categorical conclusion  two
moods are usually recognised the  modus ponens   in which the antecedent
of the hypothetical major premise is affirmed  and the  modus tollens 
 sic   in which its consequent is denied 

 1   modus ponens   or constructive 

    if a is b  c is d 
       a is b 
     ‚à¥ c is d 

if aristotle s reasoning is conclusive  plato s theory of ideas is
erroneous 

      aristotle s reasoning is conclusive 
    ‚à¥ plato s theory of ideas is erroneous 

rule of the  modus ponens   the antecedent of the major premise being
affirmed in the minor premise  the consequent is also affirmed in the
conclusion 

 2   modus tollens   or destructive 

    if a is b  c is d 
       c is not d 
     ‚à¥ a is not b 

      if pythagoras is to be trusted  justice is a number 
      justice is not a number 
    ‚à¥ pythagoras is not to be trusted 

rule of the  modus tollens   the consequent of the major premise being
denied in the minor premise  the antecedent is denied in the conclusion 

by using negative major premises two other forms are obtainable  then 
either by affirming the antecedent or by denying the consequent  we draw
a negative conclusion 

    thus   modus ponens                     modus tollens   

    if a is b  c is not d                  if a is b  c is not d 
       a is b                                 c is d 
     ‚à¥ c is not d                           ‚à¥ a is not b 

further  since the antecedent of the major premise  taken by itself  may
be negative  it seems possible to obtain four more forms  two in each
mood  from the following major premises 

     1   if a is not b  c is d 
     2   if a is not b  c is not d 

but since the quality of a hypothetical proposition is determined by the
quality of its consequent  not at all by the quality of its antecedent 
we cannot get from these two major premises any really new moods  that
is to say  moods exhibiting any formal difference from the four
previously expounded 

it is obvious that  given the hypothetical major premise  

    if a is b  c is d  

we cannot  by denying the antecedent  infer a denial of the consequent 
that a is b  is a mark of c being d  but we are not told that it is the
sole and indispensable condition of it  if men read good books  they
acquire knowledge  but they may acquire knowledge by other means  as by
observation  for the same reason  we cannot by affirming the consequent
infer the affirmation of the antecedent  caius may have acquired
knowledge  but we cannot thence conclude that he has read good books 

to see this in another light  let us recall chap  v    4  where it was
shown that a hypothetical proposition may be translated into a
categorical one  whence it follows that a hypothetical syllogism may be
translated into a categorical syllogism  treating the above examples
thus  we find that the  modus ponens   with affirmative major premise 
takes the form of barbara  and the  modus tollens  the form of
camestres 

     modus ponens                    barbara 

    if a is b  c is d       the case of a being b is a case of c being d 
       a is b                       this is a case of a being b 
     ‚à¥ c is d                     ‚à¥ this is a case of c being d 

now if  instead of this  we affirm the consequent  to form the new minor
premise 

    this is a case of c being d 

there will be a syllogism in the second figure with two affirmative
premises  and therefore the fallacy of undistributed middle  again 

     modus tollens                    camestres 

    if a is b  c is d       the case of a being b is a case of c being d 
       c is not d                this is not a case of c being d 
     ‚à¥ a is not b              ‚à¥ this is not a case of a being b 

but if  instead of this  we deny the antecedent  to form the new minor
premise 

    this is not a case of a being b 

there arises a syllogism in the first figure with a negative minor
premise  and therefore the fallacy of illicit process of the major term 

by thus reducing the hypothetical syllogism to the categorical form 
what is lost in elegance is gained in intelligibility  for  first  we
may justify ourselves in speaking of the hypothetical premise as the
major  and of the categorical premise as the minor  since in the
categorical form they contain respectively the major and minor terms 
and  secondly  we may justify ourselves in treating the hypothetical
syllogism as a kind of mediate inference  in spite of the fact that it
does not exhibit two terms compared by means of a third  since in the
categorical form such terms distinctly appear  a new term   this  
emerges in the position of the minor  the place of the middle is filled
by the antecedent of the major premise in the  modus ponens   and by the
consequent in the  modus tollens  

the mediate element of the inference in a hypothetical syllogism
consists in asserting  or denying  the fulfilment of a given condition 
just as in a categorical syllogism to identify the minor term with the
middle is a condition of the major term s being predicated of it  in the
hypothetical proposition  

    if a is b  c is d  

the antecedent   a is b   is the  conditio sufficiens   or mark  of the
consequent   c is d   and therefore the consequent   c is d   is a
 conditio sine qua non  of the antecedent   a is b   and it is by means
of affirming the former condition  or else denying the latter  that a
conclusion is rendered possible 

indeed  we need not say that the element of mediation consists in
affirming   or denying   the fulfilment of a given condition  it is
enough to say  in affirming   for thus to explain the  modus tollens  
reduce it to the  modus ponens   contrapositing the major premise and
obverting the minor  

                                                 celarent 

      if a is b  c is d               the case of c being not d is
    ‚à¥ if c is not d  a is not b         not a case of a being b 
      c is not d                      this is a case of c being
    ‚à¥ a is not b                              not d 
                                      ‚à¥ this is not a case of a
                                                being b 

the above four forms commonly treated of as hypothetical syllogisms  are
called by ueberweg and dr  keynes  hypothetico categorical   ueberweg
restricts the name  hypothetical  simply  and dr  keynes the name
 conditional   to such syllogisms as the following  having two
hypothetical premises 

      if c is d  e is f 
      if a is b  c is d 
    ‚à¥ if a is b  e is f 

if we recognise particular hypothetical propositions  see chap  v    4  
it is obvious that such syllogisms may be constructed in all the moods
and figures of the categorical syllogism  and of course they may be
translated into categoricals  we often reason in this hypothetical way 
for example 

      if the margin of cultivation be extended  rents will rise 
      if prices of produce rise  the margin of cultivation will be extended 
    ‚à¥ if prices of produce rise  rents will rise 

but the function of the hypothetical syllogism  commonly so called   as
also of the disjunctive syllogism  to be discussed in the next section 
is to get rid of the conditional element of the premises  to pass from
suspense to certainty  and obtain a decisive categorical conclusion 
whereas these syllogisms with two hypothetical premises leave us still
with a hypothetical conclusion  this circumstance seems to ally them
more closely with categorical syllogisms than with those that are
discussed in the present chapter  that they are categoricals in disguise
may be seen by considering that the above syllogism is not materially
significant  unless in each proposition the word  if  is equivalent to
 whenever   accordingly  the name  hypothetical syllogism   is here
employed in the older usage 

  2  a disjunctive syllogism consists of a disjunctive major premise  a
categorical minor premise  and a categorical conclusion 

how many moods are to be recognised in this kind of argument depends on
whether the alternatives of the disjunctive premise are regarded as
mutually exclusive or possibly coincident  in saying   either  a is b 
 or  c is d   do we mean  either  but not both   or  either  it may be
both    see chap  v    4  

when the alternatives of the disjunctive are not exclusive  we have only
the

     modus tollendo ponens  

    either a is b  or c is d 
           a is not b  or c is not d  
         ‚à¥ c is d      or a is b  

either wages fall  or the weaker hands are dismissed 

      wages do not fall 
    ‚à¥ the weaker hands are dismissed 

but we cannot argue  

      wages fall 
    ‚à¥ the weaker hands are not dismissed 

since in  hard times  both events may happen together 

rule of the  modus tollendo ponens   if one alternative be denied  the
other is affirmed 

when  however  the alternatives of the disjunctive are mutually
exclusive  we have also the

     modus ponendo tollens  

    either a is b  or c is d 
           a is b  or c is d  
         ‚à¥ c is not d  or a is not b  

either the tories or the whigs win the election 

      the tories win 
    ‚à¥ the whigs do not win 

we may also  of course  argue as above in the  modus tollendo ponens   

      the tories do not win 
    ‚à¥ the whigs do 

but in this example  to make the  modus tollendo ponens  materially
valid  it must be impossible that the election should result in a tie 
the danger of the disjunctive proposition is that the alternatives may
not  between them  exhaust the possible cases  only contradictory
alternatives are sure to cover the whole ground 

rule of the  modus ponendo tollens   if one alternative be affirmed  the
other is denied 

since a disjunctive proposition may be turned into a hypothetical
proposition  chap  v    4   a disjunctive syllogism may be turned into a
hypothetical syllogism 

     modus tollendo ponens                    modus ponens  

    either a is b  or c is d              if a is not b  c is d 
           a is not b                        a is not b 
         ‚à¥ c is d                          ‚à¥ c is d 

similarly the  modus ponendo tollens  is equivalent to that kind of
 modus ponens  which may be formed with a negative major premise  for if
the alternatives of a disjunctive proposition be exclusive  the
corresponding hypothetical be affirmative or negative 

     modus ponendo tollens                    modus ponens  

    either a is b  or c is d              if a is b  c is not d 
           a is b                            a is b 
         ‚à¥ c is not d                      ‚à¥ c is not d 

hence  finally  a disjunctive syllogism being equivalent to a
hypothetical  and a hypothetical to a categorical  a disjunctive
syllogism is equivalent and reducible to a categorical  it is a form of
mediate inference in the same sense as the hypothetical syllogism is 
that is to say  the conclusion depends upon an affirmation  or denial 
of the fulfilment of a condition implied in the disjunctive major
premise 

  3  the dilemma is perhaps the most popularly interesting of all forms
of proof  it is a favourite weapon of orators and wits  and  impaled
upon the horns of a dilemma  is a painful situation in which every one
delights to see his adversary  it seems to have been described by
rhetoricians before finding its way into works on logic  and logicians 
to judge from their diverse ways of defining it  have found some
difficulty in making up their minds as to its exact character 

there is a famous dilemma employed by demosthenes  from which the
general nature of the argument may be gathered 

    if √¶schines joined in the public rejoicings  he is
    inconsistent  if he did not  he is unpatriotic 

     but either he joined  or he did not join 

     therefore he is either inconsistent or unpatriotic 

that is  reduced to symbols 

    if a is b  c is d  and if e is f  g is h 
      but either a is b  or e is f 
    ‚à¥ either c is d or g is h   complex constructive   

this is a compound conditional syllogism  which may be analysed as
follows 

    either a is b or e is f 

    suppose that e is not f         suppose that a is not b 
    then a is b                     then e is f 
    but if a is b  c is d           but if e is f  g is h 
         a is b                           e is f  
      ‚à¥ c is d                      ‚à¥ g is h 

    ‚à¥ either c is d or g is h 

a dilemma  then  is a compound conditional syllogism  having for its
major premise two hypothetical propositions  and for its minor premise a
disjunctive proposition  whose alternative terms either affirm the
antecedents or deny the consequents of the two hypothetical propositions
forming the major premise 

the hypothetical propositions in the major premise  may have all four
terms distinct  as in the above example   and then the conclusion is a
disjunctive proposition  and the dilemma is said to be complex  or the
two hypothetical propositions may have a common antecedent or a common
consequent  and then the conclusion is a categorical proposition  and
the dilemma is said to be simple 

again  the alternatives of the disjunctive minor premise may be
affirmative or negative  if affirmative  the dilemma is called
constructive  and if negative  destructive 

using  then  only affirmative hypothetical propositions in the major
premise  there are four moods 

1  the simple constructive  

    if a is b  c is d  and if e is f  c is d 
      but either a is b  or e is f 
    ‚à¥ c is d 

    if the tories win the election  the government will avoid
    innovation  and if the whigs win  the house of lords will
    prevent them innovating 

     but either the tories or the whigs will win 

     ‚à¥ there will be no innovation 

2  the complex constructive  

    if a is b  c is d  and if e is f  g is h 
      but either a is b  or e is f 
    ‚à¥ either c is d or g is h 

    if appearance is all that exists  reality is a delusion  and
    if there is a substance beyond consciousness  knowledge of
    reality is impossible 

     but either appearance is all  or there is a substance beyond
    consciousness 

     ‚à¥ either reality is a delusion  or a knowledge of it is
    impossible 

3  simple destructive  

    if a is b  c is d  and if a is b  e is f 
      but either c is not d  or e is not f 
    ‚à¥ a is not b 

    if table rappers are to be trusted  the departed are spirits 
    and they also exert mechanical energy 

     but either the departed are not spirits  or they do not
    exert mechanical energy 

     ‚à¥ table rappers are not to be trusted 

4  complex destructive  

    if a is b  c is d  and if e is f  g is h 
      but either c is not d  or g is not h 
    ‚à¥ either a is not b  or e is not f 

    if poetic justice is observed  virtue is rewarded  and if the
    mirror is held up to nature  the villain triumphs 

     but either virtue is not rewarded  or the villain does not
    triumph 

     ‚à¥ either poetic justice is not observed  or the mirror is
    not held up to nature 

such are the four moods of the dilemma that emerge if we only use
affirmative hypotheticals for the major premise  but  certainly  it is
often quite as natural to employ two negative hypotheticals  indeed 
one might be affirmative and the other negative  but waive that   and
then four more moods emerge  all having negative conclusions  it is
needless to intimidate the reader by drawing up these four moods in
battle array  they always admit of reduction to the foregoing moods by
obverting the hypotheticals  still  by the same process we may greatly
decrease the number of moods of the categorical syllogism  and just as
some syllogisms are most simply expressed in celarent or cesare  so some
dilemmas are most simply stated with negative major premises  e g  
the example of a simple constructive dilemma above given would run more
naturally thus   if the tories win  the government will not innovate 
and if the whigs  the lords will not let them   and similarly
demosthenes  dilemma   if √¶schines joined  he is not consistent  and if
he did not  he is not patriotic   moreover  the propriety of recognising
dilemmas with negative major premises  follows from the above analysis
of the dilemma into a combination of conditional syllogisms  even if  as
in   1 of this chapter  we take account of only four moods of the
hypothetical syllogism 

in the rhetorical use of the dilemma  it may be observed that the
disjunction in the minor premise ought to be obvious  or  at any rate 
easily acceptable to the audience  thus   either the tories or the whigs
will win  either √¶schines joined in the rejoicings  or he did not   such
propositions are not likely to be disputed  but if the orator must stop
to prove his minor premise  the smacking effect of this figure  if the
expression be allowed  will be lost  hence the minor premises of other
examples given above are only fit for a select audience  that  either
ghosts are not spirits  or they do not exert mechanical energy  
supposes a knowledge of the principle  generally taught by physical
philosophers  that only matter is the vehicle of energy  and that
 either appearance is all  or there is substance beyond consciousness  
is a doctrine which only metaphysical philosophers could be expected to
understand  and upon which they could not be expected to agree  however 
the chief danger is that a plausible disjunction may not be really such
as to exclude any middle ground   either the tories or the whigs win  
is bad  if a tie be possible  though in the above argument this is
negligible  seeing that a tie cannot directly cause innovations   either
√¶schines joined in the rejoicings  or he did not   does not allow for a
decent conformity with the public movement where resistance would be
vain  yet such conformity as need not be inconsistent with subsequent
condemnation of the proceedings  nor incompatible with patriotic reserve
founded on a belief that the rejoicings are premature and ominous 

another rhetorical consideration is  that the alternatives of the
disjunctive conclusion of a complex dilemma should both point the same
way  should be equally distasteful or paradoxical   either inconsistent
or unpatriotic   horrid words to a politician   either no reality or no
possible knowledge of it   very disappointing to an anxious inquirer 
thus the disjunctive conclusion is as bad for an opponent as the
categorical one in a simple dilemma 

logicians further speak of the trilemma  with three hypotheticals and a
corresponding triple disjunction  and of a polylemma  with any further
number of perplexities  but anyone who has a taste for logical forms may
have it amply gratified in numerous text books 




chapter xiii

transition to induction


  1  having now discussed terms  propositions  immediate and mediate
inferences  and investigated the conditions of formal truth or
consistency  we have next to consider the conditions of material truth 
whether  or how far  it is possible to arrive at propositions that
accurately represent the course of nature or of human life  hitherto we
have dealt with no sort of proof that gives any such assurance  a valid
syllogism guarantees the truth of its conclusion  provided the premises
be true  but what of the premises  the relation between the premises of
a valid syllogism and its conclusion is the same as the relation between
the antecedent and consequent of a hypothetical proposition  if a is b 
c is d  grant that a is b  and it follows that c is d  and  similarly 
grant the premises of a syllogism  and the conclusion follows  again 
grant that c is not d  and it follows that a is not b  and  similarly 
if the conclusion of a valid syllogism be false  it follows that one  or
other  or both of the premises must be false  but  once more  grant that
c is d  and it does not follow that a is b  so neither  if the
conclusion of a syllogism be true  does it follow that the premises are 
for example   

      sociology is an exact science 
      mathematics is a branch of sociology 
    ‚à¥ mathematics is an exact science 

here the conclusion is true although the premises are absurd  or
again   

      mathematics is an exact science 
      sociology is a branch of mathematics 
    ‚à¥ sociology is an exact science 

here the major premise is true  but the minor is false  and the
conclusion is false  in both cases  however  whether the conclusion be
true or false  it equally follows from the premises  if there is any
cogency in barbara  the explanation of this is  that barbara has only
formal cogency  and that whether the conclusion of that  or any other
valid mood  shall be true according to fact and experience  depends upon
how the form is filled up  how to establish the premises  then  is a
most important problem  and it still remains to be solved 

  2  we may begin by recalling the distinction between the denotation
and connotation of a general term  the denotation comprising the things
or events which the term is a name for  the connotation comprising the
common qualities on account of which these things are called by the same
name  obviously  there are very few general terms whose denotation is
exhaustively known  since the denotation of a general term comprises all
the things that have its connotation  or that ever have had  or that
ever will have it  whether they exist here  or in australia  or in the
moon  or in the utmost stars  no one has examined all men  all mammoths 
all crystals  all falling bodies  all cases of fever  all revolutions 
all stars  nor even all planets  since from time to time new ones are
discerned  we have names for animals that existed long before there were
men to observe them  and of which we know only a few bones  the remains
of multitudinous species  and for others that may continue to exist when
men have disappeared from the earth 

if  indeed  we definitely limit the time  or place  or quantity of
matter to be explored  we may sometimes learn  within the given limits 
all that there is to know  as all the bones of a particular animal  or
the list of english monarchs hitherto  or the names of all the members
of the house of commons at the present time  such cases  however  do not
invalidate the above logical truth that few general terms are
exhaustively known in their denotation  for the very fact of assigning
limits of time and place impairs the generality of a term  the bones of
a certain animal may be all examined  but not the bones of all animals 
nor even of one species  the english monarchs that have reigned hitherto
may be known  but there may be many still to reign 

the general terms  then  with which logic is chiefly concerned  the
names of causes and kinds  such as gravitation  diseases  social events 
minerals  plants and animals  stand for some facts that are  or have
been  known  and for a great many other similar ones that have not been 
and never will be  known  the use of a general term depends not upon our
direct knowledge of everything comprised in its denotation  but upon our
readiness to apply it to anything that has its connotation  whether we
have seen the thing or not  and even though we never can perceive it  as
when a man talks freely of the ichthyosaurus  or of the central heat of
planets  or of atoms and ether 

hence universal propositions  which consist of general terms  deceive
us  if we suppose that their predicates are directly known to be related
to all the facts denoted by their subjects  in exceptional cases  in
which the denotation of a subject is intentionally limited  such
exhaustive direct knowledge may be possible  as that  all the bones of a
certain animal consist of phosphate of lime   or that every member of
the present parliament wears a silk hat  but what predication is
possible concerning the hats of all members of parliament from the
beginning  ordinarily  then  whilst the relation of predicate to subject
has been observed in some cases  in much the greater number of cases
our belief about it depends upon something besides observation  or may
be said  in a certain sense  to be taken on trust 

 all rabbits are herbivorous   why do we believe that  we may have seen
a few wild rabbits feeding  or have kept tame ones  and tried
experiments with their diet  or have read of their habits in a book of
natural history  or have studied the anatomy and physiology of the
digestive system in many sorts of animals  but with whatever care we add
testimony and scientific method to our own observation  it still remains
true that the rabbits observed by ourselves and others are few in
comparison with those that live  have lived and will live  similarly of
any other universal proposition  that it  goes beyond the evidence  of
direct observation plainly follows from the fact that the general terms 
of which such propositions consist  are never exhaustively known in
their denotation  what right have we then to state universal
propositions  that is the problem of inductive logic 

  3  universal propositions  of course  cannot always be proved by
syllogisms  because to prove a universal proposition by a syllogism  its
premises must be universal propositions  and  then  these must be proved
by others  this process may sometimes go a little way  thus   all men
are mortal   because  all animals are   and  all animals are mortal  
because  all composite bodies are subject to dissolution   were there no
limit to such sorites  proof would always involve a  regressus ad
infinitum   for which life is too short  but  in fact  prosyllogisms
soon fail us 

clearly  the form of the syllogism must itself be misleading if the
universal proposition is so  if we think that premises prove the
conclusion because they themselves have been established by detailed
observation  we are mistaken  the consideration of any example will show
this  suppose any one to argue 

      all ruminants are herbivorous 
      camels are ruminants 
    ‚à¥ camels are herbivorous 

have we  then  examined all ruminants  if so  we must have examined all
camels  and cannot need a syllogism to prove their herbivorous nature 
instead of the major premise proving the conclusion  the proof of the
conclusion must then be part of the proof of the major premise  but if
we have not examined all ruminants  having omitted most giraffes  most
deer  most oxen  etc   how do we know that the unexamined  say  some
camels  are not exceptional  camels are vicious enough to be
carnivorous  and indeed it is said that bactrian camels will eat flesh
rather than starve  though of course their habit is herbivorous 

or  again  it is sometimes urged that  

      all empires decay 
    ‚à¥ britain will decay 

this is manifestly a prediction  at present britain flourishes  and
shows no signs of decay  yet a knowledge of its decay seems necessary 
to justify any one in asserting the given premise  if it is a question
whether britain will decay  to attempt  while several empires still
flourish  to settle the matter by asserting that  all  empires decay 
seems to be  a begging of the question   but although this latter case
is a manifest prediction  it does not really differ from the former one 
for the proof that camels are herbivorous has no limits in time  if
valid  it shows not only that they are  but also that they will be 
herbivorous 

hence  to resort to a dilemma  it may be urged  if  all  the facts of
the major premise of any syllogism have been examined  the syllogism is
needless  and if  some  of them have not been examined  it is a  petitio
principii   but either all have been examined  or some have not 
therefore  the syllogism is either useless or fallacious 

  4  a way of escape from this dilemma is provided by distinguishing
between the formal and material aspects of the syllogism considered as a
means of proof  it begs the question formally  but not materially  that
is to say  if it be a question whether camels are herbivorous  and to
decide it we are told that   all  ruminants are   laying stress upon the
 all   as if all had been examined  though in fact camels have not been 
then the question as to camels is begged  the form of a universal
proposition is then offered as evidence  when in fact the evidence has
not been universally ascertained  but if in urging that  all ruminants
are herbivorous  no more is meant than that so many other ruminants of
different species are known to be herbivorous  and that the ruminant
stomach is so well adapted to a coarse vegetable diet  that the same
habit may be expected in other ruminants  such as camels  the argument
then rests upon material evidence without unfairly implying the case in
question  now the nature of the material evidence is plainly this  that
the resemblance of camels to deer  oxen  etc   in chewing the cud 
justifies us in believing that they have a further resemblance in
feeding on herbs  in other words  we assume that  resemblance is a
ground of inference  

another way of putting this difficulty which we have just been
discussing  with regard to syllogistic evidence  is to urge that by the
laws of syllogism a conclusion must never go beyond the premises  and
that therefore no progress in knowledge can ever be established  except
by direct observation  now  taking the syllogism formally  this is true 
if the conclusion go beyond the premises  there must be either four
terms  or illicit process of the major or minor term  but  taking it
materially  the conclusion may cover facts which were not in view when
the major premise was laid down  facts of which we predicate something
not as the result of direct observation  but because they resemble in a
certain way those facts which had been shown to carry the predicate when
the major premise was formed 

 what sort of resemblance is a sufficient ground of inference   is 
therefore  the important question alike in material deduction and in
induction  and in endeavouring to answer it we shall find that the
surest ground of inference is resemblance of causation  for example  it
is due to causation that ruminants are herbivorous  their instincts make
them crop the herb  and their stomachs enable them easily to digest it 
and in these characters camels are like the other ruminants 

  5  in ch  ix    3  the  dictum de omni et nullo  was stated   whatever
may be predicated of a term distributed may be predicated of anything
that can be identified with that term   nothing was there said  as
nothing was needed  of the relations that might be implied in the
predication  but now that it comes to the ultimate validity of
predication  we must be clear as to what these relations are  and it
will also be convenient to speak no longer of terms  as in formal logic 
but of the things denoted  what relations  then  can be determined
between concrete facts or phenomena  physical or mental  with the
greatest certainty of general truth  and what axioms are there that
sanction mediate inferences concerning those relations 

in his  logic   b  ii  c  2    3  mill gives as the axiom of syllogistic
reasoning  instead of the  dictum    a thing which co exists with
another thing  which other co exists with a third thing  also co exists
with that third thing   thus the peculiar properties of socrates
co exist with the attributes of man  which co exist with mortality 
therefore  socrates is mortal  but  again  he says that the ground of
the syllogism is induction  that man is mortal is an induction  and 
further  the ground of induction is causation  the law of causation is
the ultimate major premise of every sound induction  now causation is
the principle of the succession of phenomena  how  then  can the
syllogism rest on an axiom concerning co existence  on reflection  too 
it must appear that  man is mortal  predicates causation  the human
constitution issues in death 

the explanation of this inconsistency may perhaps be found in the
history of mill s work  books i  and ii  were written in 1831  but being
unable at that time to explain induction  he did not write book iii 
until 1837 8  then  no doubt  he revised the earlier books  but not
enough to bring his theory of the syllogism into complete agreement with
the theory of induction  so that the axiom of co existence was allowed
to stand 

mill also introduced the doctrine of natural kinds as a ground of
induction supplementary  at least provisionally  to causation  and to
reasoning about kinds  or substance and attribute  his axiom of
co existence is really adapted  kinds are groups of things that agree
amongst themselves and differ from all others in a multitude of
qualities  these qualities co exist  or co inhere  with a high degree of
constancy  so that where some are found others may be inferred  their
co inherence is not to be considered an ultimate fact  for   since
everything which occurs is determined by laws of causation and
collocations of the original causes  it follows that the co existences
observable amongst effects cannot themselves be the subject of any
similar set of laws distinct from laws of causation   b  iii  c  5   
9   according to the theory of evolution  worked out since mill wrote  
kinds  that is  species of plants  animals and minerals  with their
qualities are all due to causation  still  as we can rarely  or never 
trace the causes with any fullness or precision  a great deal of our
reasoning  as  e g   about men and camels  does in fact trust to the
relative permanence of natural kinds as defined by co inhering
attributes 

to see this more clearly  we should consider that causation and natural
kinds are not at present separable  propositions about causation in
concrete phenomena  as distinct from abstract  forces   always involve
the assumption of kinds  for example   water rusts iron   or the oxygen
of water combines with iron immersed in it to form rust  this statement
of causation assumes that water  oxygen  iron  and iron rust are known
kinds  on the other hand  the constitution of every concrete thing  and
manifestly of every organised body  is always undergoing change  that
is  causation  upon which fact its properties depend 

how  then  can we frame principles of mediate reasoning  about such
things  so far as we consider them as kinds  it is enough to say 
 whatever can be identified as a specimen of a known substance or kind
has the properties of that kind   so far as we consider them as in the
relation of causation  we may say   whatever relation of events can be
identified with the relation of cause and effect is constant   and these
principles may be generalised thus   whatever is constantly related to a
phenomenon  cause or kind   determined by certain characters  is related
in the same way to any phenomenon  that has the same characters   taking
this as axiom of the syllogism materially treated  we see that
herbivorousness  being constantly related to ruminants  is constantly
related to camels  mortality to man and  therefore  to socrates  rusting
to the immersion of iron in water generally and  therefore  to this
piece of iron   nota notae  nota rei ipsius  is another statement of the
same principle  still another is mill s axiom   whatever has a mark has
what it is a mark of   a mark is anything  a  that is never found
without something else  b   a phenomenon constantly related to another
phenomenon  so that wherever a is found  b may be expected  human nature
is a mark of mortality 

  6  the syllogism has sometimes been discarded by those who have only
seen that  as formally stated  it is either useless or fallacious  but
those who also perceive its material grounds retain and defend it  in
fact  great advantages are gained by stating an argument as a formal
syllogism  for  in the first place  we can then examine separately the
three conditions on which the validity of the argument depends 

 1  are the premises so connected that   if they are true   the
conclusion follows  this depends upon the formal principles of chap  x 

 2  is the minor premise true  this question can only arise when the
minor premise is a real proposition  and then it may be very difficult
to answer  water rusts iron  but is the metal we are now dealing with a
fair specimen of iron  few people  comparatively  know how to determine
whether diamonds  or even gold or silver coins  are genuine  that
 camels are ruminants  is now a verbal proposition to a zoologist  but
not to the rest of us  and to the zoologist the ascertaining of the
relation in which camels stand to such ruminants as oxen and deer  was
not a matter of analysing words but of dissecting specimens  what a long
controversy as to whether the human race constitutes a family of the
primates  that  the british empire is an empire  affords no matter for
doubt or inquiry  but how difficult to judge whether the british empire
resembles assyria  egypt  rome  spain in those characters and
circumstances that caused their downfall 

 3  is the major premise true  are all ruminants herbivorous  if there
be any exceptions to the rule  camels are likely enough to be among the
exceptions  and here the need of inductive logic is most conspicuous 
how can we prove our premises when they are universal propositions 
universal propositions  however  are also involved in proving the minor
premise  to prove a thing to be iron  we must know the constant
reactions of iron 

a second advantage of the syllogism is  that it makes us fully aware of
what an inference implies  an inference must have some grounds  or else
it is a mere prejudice  but whatever the grounds  if sufficient in a
particular case  they must be sufficient for all similar cases  they
must admit of being generalised  and to generalise the grounds of the
inference  is nothing else than to state the major premise  if the
evidence is sufficient to justify the argument that camels are
herbivorous  because  they are ruminants  it must also justify the major
premise   all ruminants are herbivorous   for else the inference cannot
really depend merely upon the fact of ruminating  to state our evidence
syllogistically  then  must be possible  if the evidence is mediate and
of a logical kind  and to state it in this formal way  as depending on
the truth of a general principle  the major premise   increases our
sense of responsibility for the inference that is thus seen to imply so
much  and if any negative instances lie within our knowledge  we are the
more likely to remember them  the use of syllogisms therefore tends to
strengthen our reasonings 

a third advantage is  that to formulate an accurate generalisation may
be useful to others  it is indeed part of the systematic procedure of
science  the memoranda of our major premises  or reasons for believing
anything  may be referred to by others  and either confirmed or refuted 
when such a memorandum is used for further inferences  these inferences
are said  in the language of formal logic  to be drawn  from  it  as if
the conclusion were contained in our knowledge of the major premise 
but  considering the limited extent of the material evidence  it is
better to say that the inference is drawn  according to  the memorandum
or major premise  since the grounds of the major premise and of the
conclusion are in fact the same  mill   logic   b  ii  c  3   inductive
proofs may be stated in syllogisms  and inductive inferences are drawn
 according to  the law of causation 

  7  to assume that resemblance is a ground of inference  and that
substance and attribute  or cause and effect  are phenomena constantly
related  implies belief in the uniformity of nature  the uniformity of
nature cannot be defined  and is therefore liable to be misunderstood 
in many ways nature seems not to be uniform  there is great variety in
the sizes  shapes  colours and all other properties of things  bodies
falling in the open air  pebbles  slates  feathers  descend in different
lines and at different rates  the wind and weather are proverbially
uncertain  the course of trade or of politics  is full of surprises  yet
common maxims  even when absurd  testify to a popular belief that the
relations of things are constant  the doctrine of st  swithin and the
rhyme beginning  evening red and morning grey   show that the weather is
held to be not wholly unpredictable  as to human affairs  it is
said that  a green yule makes a fat churchyard   that  trade follows the
flag   and that  history repeats itself   and superstition knows that
witches cannot enter a stable door if a horse shoe is nailed over it 
and that the devil cannot cross a threshold inscribed with a perfect
pentagram  but the surest proof of a belief in the uniformity of nature
is given by the conduct of men and animals  by that adherence to habit 
custom and tradition  to which in quiet times they chiefly owe their
safety  but which would daily disappoint and destroy them  if it were
not generally true that things may be found where they have been left
and that in similar circumstances there are similar events 

now this general belief  seldom distinctly conceived  for the most part
quite unconscious  as a principle   merely implied in what men do  is
also the foundation of all the sciences  which are entirely occupied in
seeking the laws  that is  the uniformities  of nature  as the
uniformity of nature cannot be defined  it cannot be proved  the most
convincing evidence in its favour is the steady progress made by science
whilst trusting in it  nevertheless  what is important is not the
comprehensive but indeterminate notion of uniformity so much as a number
of first principles  which may be distinguished in it as follows 

 1  the principles of contradiction and excluded middle  ch  vi    3 
declare that in a given relation to a given phenomenon any two or more
other phenomena are incompatible   b is not a and a    whilst the given
phenomenon either stands related to another phenomenon or not   b is
either a or a    it is not only a matter of logic but of fact that  if a
leaf is green  it is not under the same conditions red or blue  and that
if it is not green it is some other colour 

 2  certain axioms of mediate evidence  as  in mathematics   that
magnitudes equal to the same magnitude are equal to one another   and 
in logic  the  dictum  or its material equivalent 

 3  that all times and all spaces are commensurable  although in certain
relations of space  as œÄ  the unit of measurement must be infinitely
small   if time really trotted with one man and galloped with another 
as it seems to  if space really swelled in places  as de quincey dreamed
that it did  life could not be regulated  experience could not be
compared and science would be impossible  the mathematical axioms would
then never be applicable to space or time  or to the objects or
processes that fill them 

 4  the persistence of matter and energy  the physical principle that 
in all changes of the universe  the quantities of matter and energy
 actual and potential  so called  remain the same   for example  as to
matter  although dew is found on the grass at morning without any
apparent cause  and although a candle seems to burn away to a scrap of
blackened wick  yet every one knows that the dew has been condensed from
vapour in the air  and that the candle has only turned into gas and
smoke  as to energy  although a stone thrown up to the housetop and
resting there has lost actual energy  it has gained such a position that
the slightest touch may bring it to the earth again in the same time as
it took to travel upwards  so on the house top it is said to have
potential energy  when a boiler works an engine  every time the piston
is thrust forward  mechanical energy   an equivalent in heat  molecular
energy  is lost  but for the elucidation of these principles  readers
must refer to treatises of chemistry and physics 

 5  causation  a special form of the foregoing principles of the
persistence of matter and energy  we shall discuss in the next chapter 
it is not to be conceived of as anything occult or noumenal  but merely
as a special mode of the uniformity of nature or experience 

 6  certain uniformities of co existence  but for want of a general
principle of co existence  corresponding to causation  the principle of
succession   we can only classify these uniformities as follows 

 a  the geometrical  as that  in a four sided figure  if the opposite
angles are equal  the opposite sides are equal and parallel   countless
similar uniformities of co existence are disclosed by geometry  the
co existent facts do not cause one another  nor are they jointly caused
by something else  they are mutually involved  such is the nature of
space 

 b  universal co inherences among the properties of concrete
things   the chief example is the co inherence of gravity with inertia
in all material bodies  there is  i believe  no other entirely
satisfactory case  but some good approximations to such uniformity are
known to physical science 

 c  co existence due to causation  such as the positions of objects in
space at any time   the houses of a town are where they are  because
they were put there  and they remain in their place as long as no other
causes arise strong enough to remove or destroy them  similarly  the
relative positions of rocks in geological strata  and of trees in a
forest  are due to causes 

 d  the co inherence of properties in natural kinds  which we call the
constitution  defining characters  or specific nature of such
things   oxygen  platinum  sulphur and the other elements  water  common
salt  alcohol and other compounds  the various species of plants and
animals  all these are known to us as different groups of co inherent
properties  it may be conjectured that these groupings of properties are
also due to causation  and sometimes the causes can be traced  but very
often the causes are still unknown  and  until resolved into their
causes  they must be taken as necessary data in the investigation of
nature  laws of the co inherence of the properties of kinds do not  like
laws of causation  admit of methodical proof upon their own principles 
but only by constancy in experience and statistical probability  c  xix 
  4  

 e  there are also a few cases in which properties co exist in an
unaccountable way  without being co extensive with any one species 
genus  or order  as most metals are whitish  and scarlet flowers are
wanting in fragrance   on this   7  see venn s  empirical logic   c  4  

  8  inasmuch as axioms of uniformity are ultimate truths  they cannot
be deduced  and inasmuch as they are universal  no proof by experience
can ever be adequate  the grounds of our belief in them seem to be
these 

 1  every inference takes for granted an order of nature corresponding
with it  and every attempt to explain the origin of anything assumes
that it is the transformation of something else  so that uniformity of
order and conservation of matter and energy are necessary
presuppositions of reasoning 

 2  on the rise of philosophic reflection  these tacit presuppositions
are first taken as dogmas  and later as postulates of scientific
generalisation  and of the architectonic unification of science  here
they are indispensable 

 3  the presuppositions or postulates are  in some measure  verifiable
in practical life and in scientific demonstration  and the better
verifiable as our methods become more exact 

 4  there is a cause of this belief that cannot be said to contain any
evidence for it  namely  the desire to find in nature a foundation for
confidence in our own power to foresee and to control events 




chapter xiv

causation


  1  for the theory of induction  the specially important aspect of the
uniformity of nature is causation 

for  1  the principles of contradiction and excluded middle are implied
in all logical operations  and need no further explication 

 2  that one thing is a mark of another or constantly related to it 
must be established by induction  and the surest of all marks is a
cause  so that the application of the axiom of the syllogism in
particular cases requires  when most valid  a previous appeal to
causation 

 3  the uniformity of space and of time is involved in causation  so far
as we conceive causation as essentially matter in motion  for motion is
only known as a traversing of space in time  and so far as forces vary
in any way according to the distance between bodies  so that if space
and time were not uniform  causation would be irregular  not that time
and space are agents  but they are conditions of every agent s
operation 

 4  the persistence of matter and energy  being nothing else than
causation in the general movement of the world  is applied under the
name of that principle in explaining any particular limited phenomenon 
such as a soap bubble  or a thunderstorm  or the tide 

 5  as to co existences  the geometrical do not belong to logic  those
involved in the existence of plants  animals  and inorganic bodies 
must  as far as possible  be traced to causes  and so  of course  must
the relative positions of objects in space at any time  and what
co existences remain do not admit of methodical inductive treatment 
they will be briefly discussed in chap  xix 

causation  then  is that mode or aspect of the uniformity of nature
which especially concerns us in induction  and we must make it as
definite as possible  it is nothing occult  but merely a convenient name
for phenomena in a particular relation to other phenomena  called their
effect  similarly  if the word  force  is sometimes used for convenience
in analysing causation  it means nothing more than something in time and
space  itself moving  or tending to move  or hindering or accelerating
other things  if any one does not find these words convenient for the
purpose  he can use others 

  2  a cause  according to mill  is  the invariable unconditional
antecedent  of a given phenomenon  to enlarge upon this 

 1  a cause is  relative to a given phenomenon   called the effect 
logic has no method for investigating the cause of the universe as a
whole  but only of a part or epoch of it  we select from the infinite
continuum of nature any portion that is neither too large nor too small
for a trained mind to comprehend  the magnitude of the phenomenon may be
a matter of convenience  if the cause of disease in general be too wide
a problem  can fevers be dealt with  or  if that be too much  is typhus
within the reach of inquiry  in short  how much can we deal with
accurately 

 2  the given phenomenon is always  an event   that is to say  not a new
thing  nothing is wholly new   but a change in something  or in the
relative position of things  we may ask the cause of the phases of the
moon  of the freezing of water  of the kindling of a match  of a deposit
of chalk  of the differentiation of species  to inquire the cause of
france being a republic  or russia an autocracy  implies that these
countries were once otherwise governed  or had no government  to inquire
the cause of the earth being shaped like an orange  implies that the
matter of the earth had once another shape 

 3  the cause is  antecedent  to the effect  which accordingly is often
called its  consequent   this is often misunderstood and sometimes
disputed  it has been said that the meaning of  cause  implies an
 effect   so that until an effect occurs there can be no cause  but this
is a blunder  for whilst the word  cause  implies  effect   it also
implies the relative futurity of the effect  and effect implies the
relative priority of the cause  the connotation of the words  therefore 
agrees well enough with mill s doctrine  in fact  the danger is that any
pair of contrasted words may suggest too strongly that the phenomena
denoted are separate in nature  whereas every natural process is
continuous  if water  dripping from the roof wears away a stone  it fell
on the roof as rain  the rain came from a condensing cloud  the cloud
was driven by the wind from the sea  whence it exhaled  and so on  there
is no known beginning to this  and no break in it  we may take any one
of these changes  call it an effect  and ask for its cause  or call it a
cause  and ask for its effect  there is not in nature one set of things
called causes and another called effects  but every change is both cause
 or a condition  of the future and effect of the past  and whether we
consider an event as the one or the other  depends upon the direction of
our curiosity or interest 

still  taking the event as effect  its cause is the antecedent process 
or  taking it as a cause  its effect is the consequent process  this
follows from the conception of causation as essentially motion  for that
 motion takes time  is  from the way our perceptive powers grow  an
ultimate intuition  but  for the same reason  there is no interval of
time between cause and effect  since all the time is filled up with
motion 

nor must it be supposed that the whole cause is antecedent to the
effect as a whole  for we often take the phenomenon on such a scale that
minutes  days  years  ages  may elapse before we consider the cause as
exhausted  e g   an earthquake  a battle  an expansion of credit 
natural selection operating on a given variety   and all that time the
effect has been accumulating  but we may further consider such a cause
as made up of moments or minute factors  and the effect as made up of
corresponding moments  and then the cause  taken in its moments  is
antecedent throughout to the effect  taken in its corresponding moments 

 4  the cause is the  invariable  antecedent of the effect  that is to
say  whenever a given cause occurs it always has the same effect  in
this  in fact  consists the uniformity of causation  accordingly  not
every antecedent of an event is its cause  to assume that it is so  is
the familiar fallacy of arguing   post hoc ergo propter hoc    every
event has an infinite number of antecedents that have no ascertainable
connection with it  if a picture falls from the wall in this room  there
may have occurred  just previously  an earthquake in new zealand  an
explosion in a japanese arsenal  a religious riot in india  a political
assassination in russia and a vote of censure in the house of commons 
besides millions of other less noticeable events  between none of which
and the falling of the picture can any direct causation be detected 
though  no doubt  they are all necessary occurrences in the general
world process  and remotely connected  the cause  however  was that a
door slammed violently in the room above and shook the wall  and that
the picture was heavy and the cord old and rotten  even if two events
invariably occur one after the other  as day follows night  or as the
report follows the flash of a gun  they may not be cause and effect 
though it is highly probable that they are closely connected by
causation  and in each of these two examples the events are co effects
of a common cause  and may be regarded as elements of its total effect 
still  whilst it is not true that every antecedent  or that every
invariable antecedent  of an event is its cause  the cause is conceived
of as some change in certain conditions  or some state and process of
things  such that should it exactly recur the same event would
invariably follow  if we consider the antecedent state and process of
things very widely or very minutely  it never does exactly recur  nor
does the consequent  but the purpose of induction is to get as near the
truth as possible within the limits set by our faculties of observation
and calculation  complex causal instances that are most unlikely to
recur as a whole  may be analysed into the laws of their constituent
conditions 

 5  the cause is the unconditional antecedent  a cause is never simple 
but may be analysed into several conditions  and  condition  means any
necessary factor of a cause  any thing or agent that exerts  absorbs 
transforms  or deflects energy  or any relation of time or space in
which agents stand to one another  a positive condition is one that
cannot be omitted without frustrating the effect  a negative condition
is one that cannot be introduced without frustrating the effect  in the
falling of the picture  e g   the positive conditions were the picture
 as being heavy   the slamming of the door  and the weakness of the
cord  a negative condition was that the picture should have no support
but the cord  when mill  then  defines the cause of any event as its
 unconditional  antecedent  he means that it is that group of conditions
 state and process of things  which  without any further condition  is
followed by the event in question  it is the least antecedent that
suffices  positive conditions being present and negative absent 

whatever item of the antecedent can be left out  then  without affecting
the event  is no part of the cause  earthquakes have happened in new
zealand and votes of censure in the house of commons without a picture s
falling in this room  they were not unconditional antecedents 
something else was needed to bring down a picture  unconditionality also
distinguishes a true cause from an invariable antecedent that is only a
co effect  for when day follows night something else happens  the earth
rotates upon her axis  a flash of gunpowder is not an unconditional
antecedent of a report  the powder must be ignited in a closed chamber 

by common experience  and more precisely by experiment  it is found
possible to select from among the antecedents of an event a certain
number upon which  so far as can be perceived  it is dependent  and to
neglect the rest  to purge the cause of all irrelevant antecedents is
the great art of inductive method  remote or minute conditions may
indeed modify the event in ways so refined as to escape our notice 
subject to the limitations of our human faculties  however  we are able
in many cases to secure an unconditional antecedent upon which a certain
event invariably follows  everybody takes this for granted  if the gas
will not burn  or a gun will not go off  we wonder  what can be wrong
with it   that is  what positive condition is wanting  or what negative
one is present  no one now supposes that gunnery depends upon those
 remotest of all causes   the stars  or upon the sun being in
sagittarius rather than in aquarius  or that one shoots straightest with
a silver bullet  or after saying the alphabet backwards 

 6  that the cause of any event is an immediate antecedent follows from
its being an unconditional one  for if there are three events  a b c 
causally connected  it is plain that a is not the unconditional
antecedent of c  but requires the further condition of first giving rise
to b  but that is not all  for the b that gives rise to c is never
merely the effect of a  it involves something further  take such a
simple case as the motion of the earth round the sun  neglecting all
other conditions  the other planets  etc    and let the earth s
motion at three successive moments be a b c  a is not the whole cause of
b in velocity and direction  we must add relation to the sun  say x  but
then  again  the cause of c will not be merely bx  for the relation to
the sun will have altered  so that we must represent it as bx   the
series  therefore  is ax bx  c  what is called a  remote cause  is 
therefore  doubly conditional  first  because it supposes an intervening
cause  and secondly  because it only in part determines the conditions
that constitute this intervening cause 

the immediacy of a cause being implied in its unconditionalness  is an
important clue to it  but as far as the detection of causes depends upon
sense perception  our powers  however aided by instruments  are unequal
to the subtlety of nature  between the event and what seems to us the
immediate antecedent many things  molecular or etherial changes  may
happen in chemistry or physics  the progress of science would be
impossible were not observation supplemented by hypothesis and
calculation  and where phenomena are treated upon a large scale  as in
the biological and social sciences  immediacy  as a mark of causation 
must be liberally interpreted  so far  then  as to the qualitative
character of causation 

 7  but to complete our account of it  we must briefly consider its
quantitative character  as to the matter contained  and as to the energy
embodied  cause and effect are conceived to be  equal   as to matter 
indeed  they may be more properly called identical  since the effect is
nothing but the cause redistributed  when oxygen combines with hydrogen
to form water  or with mercury to form red precipitate  the weight of
the compound is exactly equal to the weight of the elements combined in
it  when a shell explodes and knocks down a wall  the materials of the
shell and wall are scattered about  as to energy  we see that in the
heavenly bodies  which meet with no sensible impediment  it remains the
same from age to age  with things  below the moon  we have to allow for
the more or less rapid conversion of the visible motion of a mass into
other forms of energy  such as sound and heat  but the right
understanding of this point involves physical considerations of some
difficulty  as to which the reader must refer to appropriate books  such
as balfour stewart s on  the conservation of energy  

the comprehension of the quantitative aspect of causation is greatly
aided by bain s analysis of any cause into a  moving or an inciting
power  and a  collocation  of circumstances  when a demagogue by making
a speech stirs up a mob to a riot  the speech is the moving or inciting
power  the mob already in a state of smouldering passion  and a street
convenient to be wrecked  are the collocation  when a small quantity of
strychnine kills a man  the strychnine is the inciting power  the nature
of his nervo muscular system  apt to be thrown into spasms by that drug 
and all the organs of his body dependent on that system  are the
collocation  now any one who thinks only of the speech  or the drug  in
these cases  may express astonishment at the disproportion of cause and
effect 

     what great events from trivial causes spring  

but  remembering that the whole cause of the riot included the excited
mob  every one sees that its muscular power is enough to wreck a street 
and remembering that breathing depends upon the normal action of the
intercostal muscles  it is plain that if this action is stopped by
strychnine  a man must die  again  a slight rise of temperature may be a
sufficient inciting power to occasion extensive chemical changes in a
collocation of elements otherwise stable  a spark is enough to explode a
powder magazine  hence  when sufficient energy to account for any effect
cannot be found in the inciting power  or manifestly active condition 
we must look for it in the collocation which is often supposed to be
passive 

and that reminds us of another common misapprehension  namely  that in
nature some things are passive and others active  the distinction
between  agent  and  patient   this is a merely relative distinction  in
nature all things are active  to the eye some things seem at rest and
others in motion  but we know that nothing is really at rest  that
everything palpitates with molecular change  and whirls with the planet
through space  everything that is acted upon reacts according to its own
nature  the quietest looking object  say  a moss covered stone   if we
try to push or lift it  pushes or pulls us back  assuring us that
 action and reaction are equal and opposite    inertia  does not mean
want of vigour  but may be metaphorically described as the inexpugnable
resolve of everything to have its own way 

the equality of cause and effect defines and interprets the
unconditionality of causation  the cause  we have seen  is that group of
conditions which  without any further condition  is followed by a given
event  but how is such a group to be conceived  unquantified  it admits
only of a general description  quantified  it must mean a group of
conditions equal to the effect in mass and energy  the essence of the
physical world  apparently  a necessary conception of the human mind 
for if a cause seem greater than its effect  we ask what has become of
the surplus matter and energy  or if an effect seem greater than its
cause  we ask whence the surplus matter and energy has arisen  so
convinced of this truth is every experimenter  that if his results
present any deviation from it  he always assumes that it is he who has
made some mistake or oversight  never that there is indeterminism or
discontinuity in nature 

the transformation of matter and energy  then  is the essence of
causation  because it is continuous  causation is immediate  and because
in the same circumstances the transformation always follows the same
course  a cause has invariably the same effect  if a fire be lit
morning after morning in the same grate  with coal  wood  and paper of
the same quality and similarly arranged  there will be each day the same
flaming of paper  crackling of wood and glowing of coal  followed in
about the same time by the same reduction of the whole mass partly to
ashes and partly to gases and smoke that have gone up the chimney  the
flaming  crackling and glowing are  physically  modes of energy  and the
change of materials into gas and ashes is a chemical and physical
redistribution  and  if some one be present  he will be aware of all
this  and then  besides the physical changes  there will be sensations
of light  sound and heat  and these again will be always the same in the
same circumstances 

the cause of any event  then  when exactly ascertainable  has five
marks  it is  quantitatively   equal  to the effect  and  qualitatively 
 the immediate  unconditional  invariable antecedent of the effect  

  3  this scientific conception of causation has been developed and
rendered definite by the investigations of those physical sciences that
can avail themselves of exact experiments and mathematical calculation 
and it is there  in chemistry and physics  that it is most at home  the
conception can indeed be carried into the biological and social
sciences  even in its quantitative form  by making the proper
allowances  for the limbs of animals are levers  and act upon mechanical
principles  and digestion and the aeration of the blood by breathing are
partly chemical processes  there is a quantitative relation between the
food a man eats and the amount of work he can do  the numbers of any
species of plant or animal depend upon the food supply  the value of a
country s imports is equal to the value of its exports and of the
services it renders to foreigners  but  generally  the less experiment
and exact calculation are practicable in any branch of inquiry  the less
rigorously can the conception of causation be applied there  the more
will its application depend upon the qualitative marks  and the more
need there will be to use it judiciously  in every inquiry the greatest
possible precision must be aimed at  but it is unreasonable to expect in
any case more precise proof than the subject admits of in the existing
state of culture 

wherever mental action is involved  there is a special difficulty in
applying the physical notion of causation  for if a cause be conceived
of as matter in motion  a thought  or feeling  or volition can be
neither cause nor effect  and since mental action is involved in all
social affairs  and in the life of all men and animals  it may seem
impossible to interpret social or vital changes according to laws of
causation  still  animals and men are moving bodies  and it is
recognised that their thoughts and feelings are so connected with their
movements and with the movements of other things acting upon them  that
we can judge of one case by another  although the connection is by no
means well understood  and the best words  such as all can agree to use 
have not yet been found to express even what we know about it  hence  a
regular connection being granted  i have not hesitated  to use
biological and social events and the laws of them  to illustrate
causation and induction  because  though less exact than chemical or
mechanical examples  they are to most people more familiar and
interesting 

in practical affairs  it is felt that everything depends upon causation 
how to play the fiddle  or sail a yacht  or get one s living  or defeat
the enemy  the price of pig iron six months hence  the prospects of the
harvest  the issue in a coroner s court  home rule and socialism  are
all questions of causation  but  in such cases  the conception of a
cause is rarely applied in its full scientific acceptation  as the
unconditional antecedent  or  all the conditions   neither more nor
less  upon which the event depends  this is not because men of affairs
are bad logicians  or incapable of scientific comprehension  for very
often the reverse is conspicuously true  but because practical affairs
call for promptitude and a decisive seizing upon what is predominantly
important  how learn to play the fiddle   go to a good teacher    then 
beginning young enough  with natural aptitude and great diligence  all
may be well   how defeat the enemy   be two to one at the critical
juncture    then  if the men are brave  disciplined  well armed and well
fed  there is a good chance of victory   will the price of iron improve 
 yes  for the market is oversold    that is  many have sold iron who
have none to deliver  and must at some time buy it back  and that will
put up the price  if the stock is not too great  if the demand does not
fall off  and if those who have bought what they cannot pay for are not
in the meanwhile obliged to sell   these prompt and decisive judgments
 with the parenthetic considerations unexpressed  as to what is the
cause  or predominantly important condition  of any event  are not as
good as a scientific estimate of all the conditions  when this can be
obtained  but  when time is short  the insight of trained sagacity may
be much better than an imperfect theoretical treatment of such problems 

  4  to regard the effect of certain antecedents in a narrow selective
way  is another common mistake  in the full scientific conception of an
effect it is the sum of the unconditional consequences of a given state
and process of things  the consequences immediately flowing from that
situation without further conditions  always to take account of all the
consequences of any cause would no doubt be impracticable  still the
practical  as well as the scientific interest  often requires that we
should enlarge our views of them  and there is no commoner error in
private effort or in legislation than to aim at some obvious good 
whilst overlooking other consequences of our action  the evil of which
may far outweigh that good  an important consequence of eating is to
satisfy hunger  and this is the ordinary motive to eat  but it is a
poor account of the physiological consequences  an important consequence
of firing a gun is the propulsion of the bullet or shell  but there are
many other consequences in the whole effect  and one of them is the
heating of the barrel  which  accumulating with rapid firing  may at
last put the gun out of action  the tides have consequences to shipping
and in the wear and tear of the coast that draw every one s attention 
but we are told that they also retard the rotation of the earth  and at
last may cause it to present always the same face to the sun  and 
therefore  to be uninhabitable  such concurrent consequences of any
cause may be called its co effects  the effect being the sum of them 

the neglect to take account of the whole effect  that is  of all the
co effects  in any case of causation is perhaps the reason why many
philosophers have maintained the doctrine of a  plurality of causes  
meaning not that more than one condition is operative in the antecedent
of every event  which is true   but that the same event may be due at
different times to different antecedents  that in fact there may be
 vicarious  causes  if  however  we take any effect as a whole  this
does not seem to be true  a fire may certainly be lit in many ways  with
a match or a flint and steel  or by rubbing sticks together  or by a
flash of lightning  have we not here a plurality of causes  not if we
take account of the whole effect  for then we shall find it modified in
each case according to the difference of the cause  in one case there
will be a burnt match  in another a warm flint  in the last a changed
state of electrical tension  and similar differences are found in cases
of death under different conditions  as stabbing  hanging  cholera  or
of shipwreck from explosion  scuttling  tempest  hence a coroner s court
expects to find  by examining a corpse  the precise cause of death  in
short  if we knew the facts minutely enough  it would be found that
there is only one cause  sum of conditions  for each effect  sum of
co effects   and that the order of events is as uniform backwards as
forwards 

still  as we are far from knowing events minutely  it is necessary in
practical affairs  and even in the more complex and unmanageable
scientific investigations  especially those that deal with human life 
to acknowledge a possible plurality of causes for any effect  indeed 
forgetfulness of this leads to many rash generalisations  as that
 revolutions always begin in hunger   or that  myths are a disease of
language   then there is great waste of ingenuity in reconciling such
propositions with the recalcitrant facts  a scientific method recognises
that there may be other causes of effects thus vaguely conceived  and
then proceeds to distinguish in each class of effects the peculiarities
due to different causes 

  5  the understanding of the complex nature of causes and effects helps
us to overcome some other difficulties that perplex the use of these
words  we have seen that the true cause is an  immediate  antecedent 
but if the cause is confounded with  one  of its constituent conditions 
it may seem to have long preceded the event which is regarded as its
effect  thus  if one man s death is ascribed to another s desire of
revenge  this desire may have been entertained for years before the
assassination occurred  similarly  if a shipwreck is ascribed to a
sunken reef  the rock was waiting for ages before the ship sailed that
way  but  of course  neither the desire of revenge nor the sunken rock
was  the sum of the conditions  on which the one or the other event
depended  as soon as this is complete the effect appears 

we have also seen the true effect of any state and process of things is
the immediate consequence  but if the effect be confounded with  one  of
its constituent factors  it may seem to long outlive the cessation of
the cause  thus  in nearly every process of human industry and art  one
factor of the effect  a road  a house  a tool  a picture  may  and
generally does  remain long after the work has ceased  but such a
result is not the whole effect of the operations that produce it  the
other factors may be  and some always are  evanescent  in most of such
works some heat is produced by hammering or friction  and the labourers
are fatigued  but these consequences soon pass off  hence the effect as
a whole only momentarily survives the cause  consider a pendulum which 
having been once set agoing  swings to and fro in an arc  under the
joint control of the shaft  gravitation and its own inertia  at every
moment its speed and direction change  and each change may be considered
as an effect  of which the antecedent change was one condition  in such
a case as this  which  though a very simple  is a perfectly fair example
of all causation  the duration of either cause or effect is quite
insensible  so that  as dr  venn says  an effect  rigorously conceived 
is only  the initial tendency  of its cause 

  6  mill contrasted two forms under which causation appears to us  that
is to say  the conditions constituting a cause may be modified  or
 intermixed  in the effect  in two ways  which are typified respectively
by mechanical and chemical action  in mechanical causation  which is
found in astronomy and all branches of physics  the effects are all
reducible to modes of energy  and are therefore commensurable with their
causes  they are either directly commensurable  as in the cases treated
of in the consideration of the mechanical powers  or  if different forms
of energy enter into cause and effect  such as mechanical energy 
electrical energy  heat  these different forms are severally reducible
to units  between which equivalents have been established  hence mill
calls this the  homogeneous intermixture of effects   because the
antecedents and consequents are fundamentally of the same kind 

in chemical causation  on the other hand  cause and effect  at least  as
they present themselves to us  differ in almost every way  in the act of
combination the properties of elements  except weight  disappear  and
are superseded by others in the compound  if  for example  mercury  a
heavy  silvery liquid  be heated in contact with oxygen  a colourless
gas   oxide of mercury is formed  red precipitate  which is a powder  
this compound presents very different phenomena from those of its
elements  and hence mill called this class of cases  the heteropathic
intermixture of effects   still  in chemical action  the effect is not
 in nature  heterogeneous with the cause  for the weight of a compound
is equal to the sum of the weights of the elements that are merged in
it  and an equivalence has been ascertained between the energy of
chemical combination and the heat  light  etc   produced in the act of
combination 

the heteropathic intermixture of effects is also found in organic
processes  which  indeed  are partly chemical   as when a man eats bread
and milk  and by digestion and assimilation converts them into nerve 
muscle and bone  such phenomena may make us wonder that people should
ever have believed that  effects resemble their causes   or that  like
produces like   a dim recognition of the equivalence of cause and effect
in respect of matter and motion may have aided the belief  and the
resemblance of offspring to parents may have helped  but it is probably
a residuum of magical rites  in which to whistle may be regarded as a
means of raising the wind  because the wind whistles  and rain wizards
may make a victim shed tears that the clouds also may weep 

  7  another consideration arises out of the complex character of causes
and effects  when a cause consists of two or more conditions or forces 
we may consider what effect any one of them would have if it operated
alone  that is to say  its  tendency   this is best illustrated by the
parallelogram of forces  if two forces acting upon a point  but not in
the same direction  be represented by straight lines drawn in the
direction of the forces  and in length proportional to their
magnitudes  these lines  meeting in an angle  represent severally the
tendencies of the forces  whilst if the parallelogram be completed on
these lines  the diagonal drawn from the point in which they meet
represents their  resultant  or effect 

again  considering the tendency of any force if it operated alone  we
may say that  when combined with another force  not in the same
direction  in any resultant  its tendency is  counteracted   either
partially  when the direction of the resultant is different  or wholly
when  the other force being equal and opposite  the resultant is
equilibrium  if the two forces be in the same direction  they are merely
added together  counteraction is only one mode of combination  in no
case is any force destroyed 

sometimes the separate tendencies of combined forces can only be
theoretically distinguished  as when the motion of a projectile is
analysed into a tendency to travel in the straight line of its
discharge  and a tendency to fall straight to the ground  but sometimes
a tendency can be isolated  as when   after dropping a feather in some
place sheltered from the wind  and watching it drift to and fro  as the
air  offering unequal resistances to its uneven surface  counteracts its
weight with varying success  until it slowly settles upon the
ground   we take it up and drop it again in a vacuum  when it falls like
lead  here we have the tendency of a certain cause  namely  the relation
between the feather and the earth  free from counteraction  and this is
called the  elimination  of the counteracting circumstances  in this
case indeed there is physical elimination  whereas  in the case of a
projectile  when we say that its actual motion is resolvable  neglecting
the resistance of the air  into two tendencies  one in the line of
discharge  the other earthwards  there is only theoretical elimination
of either tendency  considered as counteracting the other  and this is
more specifically called the  resolution  or analysis of the total
effect into its component conditions  now  elimination and resolution
may be said to be the essential process of induction in the widest sense
of the term  as including the combination of induction with deduction 

the several conditions constituting any cause  then  by aiding or
counteracting one another s tendencies  jointly determine the total
effect  hence  viewed in relation one to another  they may be said to
stand in  reciprocity  or mutual influence  this relation at any moment
is itself one of co existence  though it is conceived with reference to
a possible effect  as kant says  all substances  as perceived in space
at the same time  are in reciprocal activity  and what is true of the
world of things at any moment  as connected  say  by gravity   is true
of any selected group of circumstances which we regard as the particular
cause of any event to come  the use of the concept of reciprocity  then 
lies in the analysis of a cause  we must not think of reciprocity as
obtaining in the succession of cause and effect  as if the effect could
turn back upon its cause  for as the effect arises its cause disappears 
and is irrecoverable by nature or magic  there are many cases of
rhythmic change and of moving equilibria  in which one movement or
process produces another  and this produces something closely resembling
the former  and so on in long series  as with the swing of a pendulum or
the orbit of a planet  but these are series of cause and effect  not of
reciprocity 




chapter xv

inductive method


  1  it is necessary to describe briefly the process of investigating
laws of causation  not with the notion of teaching any one the art of
discovery  which each man pursues for himself according to his natural
gifts and his experience in the methods of his own science  but merely
to cast some light upon the contents of the next few chapters  logic is
here treated as a process of proof  proof supposes that some general
proposition or hypothesis has been suggested as requiring proof  and the
search for such propositions may spring from scientific curiosity or
from practical interests 

we may  as bain observes   logic   b  iii  ch  5   desire to detect a
process of causation either  1  amidst circumstances that have no
influence upon the process but only obscure it  as when  being pleased
with a certain scent in a garden  we wish to know from what flower it
rises  or  being attracted by the sound of some instrument in an
orchestra  we desire to know which it is  or  2  amidst circumstances
that alter the effect from what it would have been by the sole operation
of some cause  as when the air deflects a falling feather  or in some
more complex case  such as a rise or fall of prices that may extend over
many years 

to begin with  we must form definite ideas as to what the phenomenon is
that we are about to investigate  and in a case of any complexity this
is best done by writing a detailed description of it  e g   to
investigate the cause of a recent fall of prices  we must describe
exactly the course of the phenomenon  dating the period over which it
extends  recording the successive fluctuations of prices  with their
maxima and minima  and noting the classes of goods or securities that
were more or less affected  etc 

then the first step of elimination  as bain further observes  is  to
analyse the situation mentally   in the light of analogies suggested by
our experience or previous knowledge  dew  for example  is moisture
formed upon the surface of bodies from no apparent source  but two
possible sources are easily suggested by common experience  is it
deposited from the air  like the moisture upon a mirror when we breathe
upon it  or does it exude from the bodies themselves  like gum or
turpentine  or  again  as to a fall of prices  a little experience in
business  or knowledge of economics  readily suggests two possible
explanations  either cheaper production in making goods or carrying
them  or a scarcity of that in which the purchasing power of the chief
commercial nations is directly expressed  namely  gold 

having thus analysed the situation and considered the possibility of
one  two  three  or more possible causes  we fix upon one of them for
further investigation  that is to say  we frame an hypothesis that this
is the cause  when an effect is given to find its cause  an inquirer
nearly always begins his investigations by thus framing an hypothesis as
to the cause 

the next step is to try to  verify  this hypothesis  this we may
sometimes do by  varying the circumstances  of the phenomenon  according
to the canons of direct inductive proof to be discussed in the next
chapter  that is to say  by  observing  or  experimenting  in such a way
as to get rid of or eliminate the obscuring or disturbing conditions 
thus  to find out which flower in a garden gives a certain scent  it is
usually enough to rely on observation  going up to the likely flowers
one after the other and smelling them  at close quarters  the greater
relative intensity of the scent is sufficiently decisive  or we may
resort to a sort of experiment  plucking a likely flower  as to which we
frame the hypothesis  this is the cause   and carrying it to some place
where the air is free from conflicting odours  should observation or
experiment disprove our first hypothesis we try a second  and so on
until we succeed  or exhaust the known possibilities 

but if the phenomenon is so complex and extensive as a continuous fall
of prices  direct observation or experiment is a useless or impossible
method  and we must then resort to deduction  that is  to indirect
induction  if  for example  we take the hypothesis that the fall is due
to a scarcity of gold  we must show that there is a scarcity  what
effect such a scarcity may be expected to have upon prices from the
acknowledged laws of prices  and from the analogy of other cases of an
expanded or restricted currency  that this expectation agrees with the
statistics of recent commerce  and finally  that the alternative
hypothesis that the fall is due to cheaper production is not true 
either because there has not been a sufficient cheapening of general
production  or because  if there has been  the results to be rationally
expected from it are not such as to agree with the statistics of recent
commerce   ch  xviii  

but now suppose that  a phenomenon having been suggested for
explanation  we are unable at the time to think of any cause  to frame
any hypothesis about it  we must then wait for the phenomenon to occur
again  and  once more observing its course and accompaniments and trying
to recall its antecedents  do our best to conceive an hypothesis  and
proceed as before  thus  in the first great epidemic of influenza  some
doctors traced it to a deluge in china  others to a volcanic eruption
near java  some thought it a mild form of asiatic plague  and others
caught a specific microbe  as the disease often recurred  there were
fresh opportunities of framing hypotheses  and the microbe was
identified 

again  the investigation may take a different form  given a supposed
cause to find its effect  e g   a new chemical element  to find what
compounds it forms with other elements  or  the spots on the sun  have
they any influence upon our weather 

here  if the given cause be under control  as a new element may be  it
is possible to try experiments with it according to the canons of
inductive proof  the inquirer may form some hypothesis or expectation as
to the effects  to guide his observation of them  but will be careful
not to hold his expectation so confidently as to falsify his observation
of what actually happens 

but if the cause be  like the sun spots  not under control  the inquirer
will watch on all sides what events follow their appearance and
development  he must watch for consequences of the new cause he is
studying in many different circumstances  that his observations may
satisfy the canons of proof  but he will also resort for guidance to
deduction  arguing from the nature of the cause  if anything is known of
its nature  what consequences may be expected  and comparing the results
of this deduction with any consequent which he suspects to be connected
with the cause  and if the results of deduction and observation agree 
he will still consider whether the facts observed may not be due to some
other cause 

a cause  however  may be under control and yet be too dangerous to
experiment with  such as the effects of a poison  though  if too
dangerous to experiment with upon man  it may be tried upon animals  or
such as a proposed change of the constitution by legislation  or even
some minor act of parliament  for altering the poor law  or regulating
the hours of labour  here the first step must be deductive  we must ask
what consequences are to be expected from the nature of the change
 comparing it with similar changes   and from the laws of the special
circumstances in which it is to operate  and sometimes we may partially
verify our deduction by trying experiments upon a small scale or in a
mild form  there are conflicting deductions as to the probable effect of
giving home rule to ireland  and experiments have been made in more or
less similar cases  as in the colonies and in some foreign countries  as
to the proposal to make eight hours the legal limit of a day s labour in
all trades  we have all tried to forecast the consequences of this  and
by way of verification we might begin with nine hours  or we might
induce some other country to try the experiment first  still  no
verification by experiments on a small scale  or in a mild form  or in
somewhat similar yet different circumstances  can be considered
logically conclusive  what proofs are conclusive we shall see in the
following chapters 

  2  to begin with the conditions of direct induction   an induction is
an universal real proposition  based on observation  in reliance on the
uniformity of nature  when well ascertained  it is called a law  thus 
that all life depends on the presence of oxygen is  1  an universal
proposition   2  a real one  since the  presence of oxygen  is not
connoted by  life    3  it is based on observation   4  it relies on the
uniformity of nature  since all cases of life have not been examined 

such a proposition is here called  an induction   when it is inductively
proved  that is  proved by facts  not merely deduced from more general
premises  except the premise of nature s uniformity   and by the
 process of induction  is meant the method of inductive proof  the
phrase  process of induction  is often used in another sense  namely for
the inference or judgment by which such propositions are arrived at  but
it is better to call this  the process of hypothesis   and to regard it
as a preliminary to the process of induction  that is  proof   as
furnishing the hypothesis which  if it can stand the proper tests 
becomes an induction or law 

  3  inductive proofs are usually classed as perfect and imperfect 
they are said to be perfect when all the instances within the scope of
the given proposition have been severally examined  and the proposition
has been found true in each case  but we have seen  chap  xiii    2 
that the instances included in universal propositions concerning causes
and kinds cannot be exhaustively examined  we do not know all planets 
all heat  all liquids  all life  etc   and we never can  since a man s
life is never long enough  it is only where the conditions of time 
place  etc   are arbitrarily limited that examination can be exhaustive 
perfect induction might show  say  that every member of the present
house of commons has two christian names  such an argument is sometimes
exhibited as a syllogism in darapti with a minor premise in u   which
legitimates a conclusion in a   thus 

      a b  to z have two christian names 
      a b  to z are all the present m p  s 
    ‚à¥ all the present m p  s have two christian names 

but in such an investigation there is no need of logical method to find
the major premise  it is mere counting  and to carry out the syllogism
is a hollow formality  accordingly  our definition of induction excludes
the kind unfortunately called perfect  by including in the notion of
induction a reliance on the uniformity of nature  for this would be
superfluous if every instance in question had been severally examined 
imperfect induction  then  is what we have to deal with  the method of
showing the credibility of an universal real proposition by an
examination of  some  of the instances it includes  generally a small
fraction of them 

  4  imperfect induction is either methodical or immethodical  now 
method is procedure upon a principle  and if the method is to be precise
and conclusive  the principle must be clear and definite 

there is a geometrical method  because the axioms of geometry are clear
and definite  and by their means  with the aid of definitions  laws are
deduced of the equality of lines and angles and other relations of
position and magnitude in space  the process of proof is purely
deductive  the axioms and definitions being granted   diagrams are used
not as facts for observation  but merely to fix our attention in
following the general argument  so that it matters little how badly they
are drawn  as long as their divergence from the conditions of the
proposition to be proved is not distracting  even the appeal to
 superposition  to prove the equality of magnitudes  as in euclid i  4  
is not an appeal to observation  but to our judgment of what is implied
in the foregoing conditions  hence no inference is required from the
special case to all similar ones  for they are all proved at once 

there is also  as we have seen  a method of deductive logic resting on
the principles of consistency and the  dictum de omni et nullo   and we
shall find that there is a method of inductive logic  resting on the
principle of causation 

but there are a good many general propositions  more or less trustworthy
within a certain range of conditions  which cannot be methodically
proved for want of a precise principle by which they may be tested  and
they  therefore  depend upon immethodical induction  that is  upon the
examination of as many instances as can be found  relying for the rest
upon the undefinable principle of the uniformity of nature  since we are
not able to connect them with any of its definite modes enumerated in
chap  xiii    7  to this subject we shall return in chap  xix   after
treating of methodical induction  or the means of determining that a
relation of events is of the nature of cause and effect  because the
relation can be shown to have the marks of causation  or some of them 

  5  observations and experiments are the  material  grounds of
induction  an experiment is an observation made under prepared  and
therefore known  conditions  and  when obtainable  it is much to be
preferred  simple observation shows that the burning of the fire
depends  for one thing  on the supply of air  but it cannot show us that
it depends on oxygen  to prove this we must make experiments as by
obtaining pure oxygen and pure nitrogen  which  mixed in the proportion
of one to four  form the air  in separate vessels  and then plunging a
burning taper into the oxygen  when it will blaze fiercely  and again
plunging it into the nitrogen  when it will be extinguished  this shows
that the greater part of the air does nothing to keep the fire alight 
except by diminishing its intensity and so making it last longer 
experiments are more perfect the more carefully they are prepared  and
the more completely the conditions are known under which the given
phenomenon is to be observed  therefore  they become possible only when
some knowledge has already been gained by observation  for else the
preparation which they require could not be made 

observation  then  was the first material ground of induction  and in
some sciences it remains the chief ground  the heavenly bodies  the
winds and tides  the strata of the earth  and the movements of history 
are beyond our power to experiment with  experiments upon the living
body or mind are indeed resorted to when practicable  even in the case
of man  as now in all departments of psychology  but  if of a grave
nature  they are usually thought unjustifiable  and in political affairs
experiments are hindered by the reflection  that those whose interests
are affected must bear the consequences and may resent them  hence  it
is in physical and chemical inquiries and in the physiology of plants
and animals  under certain conditions  that direct experiment is most
constantly practised 

where direct experiment is possible  however  it has many advantages
over unaided observation  if one experiment does not enable us to
observe the phenomenon satisfactorily  we may try again and again 
whereas the mere observer  who wishes to study the bright spots on mars 
or a commercial crisis  must wait for a favourable opportunity  again 
in making experiments we can vary the conditions of the phenomenon  so
as to observe its different behaviour in each case  whereas he who
depends solely on observation must trust the bounty of nature to supply
him with a suitable diversity of instances  it is a particular advantage
of experiment that a phenomenon may sometimes be  isolated   that is 
removed from the influence of all agents except that whose operation we
desire to observe  or except those whose operation is already known 
whereas a simple observer  who has no control over the conditions of the
subject he studies  can never be quite sure that its movements or
changes are not due to causes that have never been conspicuous enough to
draw his attention  finally  experiment enables us to observe coolly and
circumspectly and to be precise as to what happens  the time of its
occurrence  the order of successive events  their duration  intensity
and extent 

but whether we proceed by observation or experiment  the utmost
attainable exactness of measurements and calculation is requisite  and
these presuppose some unit  in multiples or divisions of which the
result may be expressed  this unit cannot be an abstract number as in
arithmetic  but must be one something  an hour  or a yard  or a
pound  according to the nature of the phenomenon to be measured  but
what is an hour  or a yard or a pound  there must in each case be some
constant standard of reference to give assurance that the unit may
always have the same value   the english pound is defined by a certain
lump of platinum preserved at westminster   the unit may be identical
with the standard or some division or multiple of it  and  in measuring
the same kind of phenomena  different units may be used for different
purposes as long as each bears a constant relation to the standard 
thus  taking the rotation of the earth as the standard of time  the
convenient unit for long periods is a year  which is a multiple   for
shorter periods  a day  which is identical   for shorter still  an hour
 which is a division   or a second  or a thousandth of a second   see
jevons   principles of science   ch  14  

  6  the principle of causation is the  formal  ground of induction  and
the inductive canons derived from it are means of testing the formal
sufficiency of observations to justify the statement of a law  if we can
observe the process of cause and effect in nature we may generalise our
observation into a law  because that process is invariable  first  then 
can we observe the course of cause and effect  our power to do so is
limited by the refinement of our senses aided by instruments  such as
lenses  thermometers  balances  etc  if the causal process is
essentially molecular change  as in the maintenance of combustion by
oxygen  we cannot directly observe it  if the process is partly cerebral
or mental  as in social movements which depend on feeling and opinion 
it can but remotely be inferred  even if the process is a collision of
moving masses  billiard balls   we cannot really observe what happens 
the elastic yielding  and recoil and the internal changes that result 
though no doubt photography will throw some light upon this  as it has
done upon the galloping of horses and the impact of projectiles  direct
observation is limited to the effect which any change in a phenomenon
 or its index  produces upon our senses  and what we believe to be the
causal process is a matter of inference and calculation  the meagre and
abstract outlines of inductive logic are apt to foster the notion  that
the evidence on which science rests is simple  but it is amazingly
intricate and cumulative 

secondly  so far as we can observe the process of nature  how shall we
judge whether a true causal instance  a relation of cause and effect 
is before us  by looking for the five marks of causation  thus  in the
experiment above described  showing that oxygen supports combustion  we
find   1  that the taper which only glowed before being plunged into the
oxygen  bursts into flame when there  sequence   2  that this begins to
happen at once without perceptible interval  immediacy   3  that no
other agent or disturbing circumstance was present  the preparation of
the experiment having excluded any such thing   unconditionalness   4 
the experiment may be repeated as often as we like with the same
result  invariableness  invariableness  indeed  i do not regard as
formally necessary to be shown  supposing the other marks to be clear 
for it can only be proved within our experience  and the very object of
induction is to find grounds of belief beyond actual experience 
however  for material assurance  to guard against his own liability to
error  the inquirer will of course repeat his experiments 

the above four are the qualitative marks of causation  the fifth and
quantitative mark is the equality of cause and effect  and this  in the
above example  the chemist determines by showing that  instead of the
oxygen and wax that have disappeared during combustion  an equivalent
weight of carbon dioxide  water  etc   has been formed 

here  then  we have all the marks of causation  but in the ordinary
judgments of life  in history  politics  criticism  business  we must
not expect such clear and direct proofs  in subsequent chapters it will
appear how different kinds of evidence are combined in different
departments of investigation 

  7  the inductive canons  to be explained in the next chapter  describe
the character of observations and experiments that justify us in drawing
conclusions about causation  and  as we have mentioned  they are derived
from the principle of causation itself  according to that principle 
cause and effect are invariably  immediately and unconditionally
antecedent and consequent  and are equal as to the matter and energy
embodied 

invariability can only be observed  in any of the methods of induction 
by collecting more and more instances  or repeating experiments  of
course it can never be exhaustively observed 

immediacy  too  in direct induction  is a matter for observation the
most exact that is possible 

succession  or the relation itself of antecedent and consequent  must
either be directly observed  or some index of it   or else ascertained
by showing that energy gained by one phenomenon has been lost by
another  for this implies succession 

but to determine the unconditionality of causation  or the
indispensability of some condition  is the great object of the methods 
and for that purpose the meaning of unconditionality may be further
explicated by the following rules for the determination of a cause 


a  qualitative determination

 i   for positive instances  

to prove a supposed cause   a  any agent whose introduction among
certain conditions  without further change  is followed by a given
phenomenon  or   b  whose removal is followed by the cessation  or
modification  of that phenomenon  is  so far  the cause or an
indispensable condition of it 

to find the effect   c  any event that follows a given phenomenon  when
there is no further change  or   d  that does not occur when the
conditions of a former occurrence are exactly the same  except for the
absence of that phenomenon  is the effect of it  or is dependent on
it  


 ii   for negative instances  

to exclude a supposed cause   a  any agent that can be introduced among
certain conditions without being followed by a given phenomenon  or that
is found without that phenomenon   or  b  that can be removed when that
phenomenon is present without impairing it  or that is absent when that
phenomenon is present   is not the cause  or does not complete the
cause  of that phenomenon in those circumstances 

to exclude a supposed effect   c  any event that occurs without the
introduction  or presence  of a given phenomenon  or  d  that does not
occur when that phenomenon is introduced  or is present   is not the
effect of that phenomenon 

                                        

subject to the conditions thus stated  the rules may be briefly put as
follows 

i   a  that which  without further change  is followed by a given event
is its cause 

ii   a  that which is not so followed is not the cause 

i   b  that which cannot be left out without impairing a phenomenon is a
condition of it 

ii   b  that which can be left out is not a condition of it 


b  quantitative determination

the equality of cause and effect may be further explained by these
rules 

iii   a  when a cause  or effect  increases or decreases  so does its
effect  or cause  

iii   b  if two phenomena  having the other marks of cause and effect 
seem unequal  the less contains an unexplored factor 

iii   c  if an antecedent and consequent do not increase or decrease
correspondingly  they are not cause and effect  so far as they vary 

it will next be shown that these propositions are variously combined in
mill s five canons of induction  agreement  the joint method 
difference  variations  residues  the first three are sometimes called
qualitative methods  and the two last quantitative  and although this
grouping is not quite accurate  seeing that difference is often used
quantitatively  yet it draws attention to an important distinction
between a mere description of conditions and determination by exact
measurement 

to avoid certain misunderstandings  some slight alterations have been
made in the wording of the canons  it may seem questionable whether the
canons add anything to the above propositions  i think they do  they are
not discussed in the ensuing chapter merely out of reverence for mill 
or regard for a nascent tradition  but because  as describing the
character of observations and experiments that justify us in drawing
conclusions about causation  they are guides to the analysis of
observations and to the preparation of experiments  to many eminent
investigators the canons  as such  have been unknown  but they prepared
their work effectively so far only as they had definite ideas to the
same purport  a definite conception of the conditions of proof is the
necessary antecedent of whatever preparations may be made for proving
anything 




chapter xvi

the canons of direct induction


  1  let me begin by borrowing an example from bain   logic   b  iii  c 
6   the north east wind is generally detested in this country  as long
as it blows few people feel at their best  occasional well known causes
of a wind being injurious are violence  excessive heat or cold 
excessive dryness or moisture  electrical condition  the being laden
with dust or exhalations  let the hypothesis be that the last is the
cause of the north east wind s unwholesome quality  since we know it is
a ground current setting from the pole toward the equator and bent
westward by the rotation of the earth  so that  reaching us over
thousands of miles of land  it may well be fraught with dust  effluvia 
and microbes  now  examining many cases of north east wind  we find that
this is the only circumstance in which all the instances agree  for it
is sometimes cold  sometimes hot  generally dry  but sometimes wet 
sometimes light  sometimes violent  and of all electrical conditions 
each of the other circumstances  then  can be omitted without the n e 
wind ceasing to be noxious  but one circumstance is never absent 
namely  that it is a ground current  that circumstance  therefore  is
probably the cause of its injuriousness  this case illustrates   


 i  the canon of agreement 

 if two or more instances of a phenomenon under investigation have only
one other circumstance  antecedent or consequent  in common  that
circumstance is probably the cause  or an indispensable condition  or
the effect of the phenomenon  or is connected with it by causation  

this rule of proof  so far as it is used to establish direct causation 
depends  first  upon observation of an invariable connection between the
given phenomenon and one other circumstance  and  secondly  upon i   a 
and ii   b  among the propositions obtained from the unconditionality of
causation at the close of the last chapter 

to prove that a is causally related to  p   suppose two instances of the
occurrence of a  an antecedent  and  p   a consequent  with concomitant
facts or events  and let us represent them thus 

    antecedents      a b c          a d e
    consequents      p q r          p s t  

and suppose further that  in this case  the immediate succession of
events can be observed  then a is probably the cause  or an
indispensable condition  of  p   for  as far as our instances go  a is
the invariable antecedent of  p   and  p  is the invariable consequent
of a  but the two instances of a or  p  agree in no other circumstance 
therefore a is  or completes  the unconditional antecedent of  p   for b
and c are not indispensable conditions of  p   being absent in the
second instance  rule ii   b    nor are d and e  being absent in the
first instance  moreover   q  and  r  are not effects of a  being absent
in the second instance  rule ii   d    nor are  s  and  t   being absent
in the first instance 

it should be observed that the cogency of the proof depends entirely
upon its tending to show the unconditionality of the sequence a  p   or
the indispensability of a as a condition of  p   that  p  follows a 
even immediately  is nothing by itself  if a man sits down to study and 
on the instant  a hand organ begins under his window  he must not infer
malice in the musician  thousands of things follow one another every
moment without traceable connection  and this we call  accidental   even
invariable sequence is not enough to prove direct causation  for  in
our experience does not night invariable follow day  the proof requires
that the instances be such as to show not merely what events  are  in
invariable sequence  but also what  are not   from among the occasional
antecedents of  p   or consequents of a  we have to eliminate the
accidental ones  and this is done by finding or making  negative
instances  in respect of each of them  thus the instance

     a d e
     p s t 

is a negative instance of b and c considered as supposable causes of  p 
 and of  q  and  r  as supposable effects of a   for it shows that they
are absent when  p   or a  is present 

to insist upon the cogency of  negative instances  was bacon s great
contribution to inductive logic  if we neglect them  and merely collect
examples of the sequence a  p   this is  simple enumeration   and
although simple enumeration  when the instances of agreement are
numerous enough  may give rise to a strong belief in the connection of
phenomena  yet it can never be a methodical or logical proof of
causation  since it does not indicate the unconditionalness of the
sequence  for simple enumeration of the sequence a  p  leaves open the
possibility that  besides a  there is always some other antecedent of
 p   say x  and then x may be the cause of  p   to disprove it  we must
find  or make  a negative instance of x  where  p  occurs  but x is
absent 

so far as we recognise the possibility of a plurality of causes  this
method of agreement cannot be quite satisfactory  for then  in such
instances as the above  although d is absent in the first  and b in the
second  it does not follow that they are not the causes of  p   for they
may be alternative causes  b may have produced  p  in the first
instance  and d in the second  a being in both cases an accidental
circumstance in relation to  p   to remedy this shortcoming by the
method of agreement itself  the only course is to find more instances of
 p   we may never find a negative instance of a  and  if not  the
probability that a is the cause of  p  increases with the number of
instances  but if there be no antecedent that we cannot sometimes
exclude  yet the collection of instances will probably give at last all
the causes of  p   and by finding the proportion of instances in which
a  b  or x precedes  p   we may estimate the probability of any one of
them being the cause of  p  in any given case of its occurrence 

but this is not enough  since there cannot really be vicarious causes 
we must define the effect   p   more strictly  and examine the cases to
find whether there may not be varieties of  p   with each of which one
of the apparent causes is correlated  a with  p ^ 1  b with  p ^ 11   x
with  p ^ 111   or  again  it may be that none of the recognised
antecedents is effective  as we here depend solely on observation  the
true conditions may be so recondite and disguised by other phenomena as
to have escaped our scrutiny  this may happen even when we suppose that
the chief condition has been isolated  the drinking of foul water was
long believed to cause dysentery  because it was a frequent antecedent 
whilst observation had overlooked the bacillus  which was the
indispensable condition 

again  though we have assumed that  in the instances supposed above 
immediate sequence is observable  yet in many cases it may not be so  if
we rely only on the canon of agreement  if instances cannot be obtained
by experiment  and we have to depend on observation  the phenomena may
then be so mixed together that a and  p  seem to be merely concomitant 
so that  though connection of some sort may be rendered highly probable 
we may not be able to say which is cause and which is effect  we must
then try  as bain says  to trace the expenditure of energy  if  p  gains
when a loses  the course of events if from a to  p  

moreover  where succession cannot be traced  the method of agreement may
point to a connection between two or more facts  perhaps as co effects
of a remote cause  where direct causation seems to be out of the
question  e g   that negroes  though of different tribes  different
localities  customs  etc   are prognathous  woolly haired and
dolichocephalic 

the method of agreement  then  cannot by itself prove causation  its
chief use  as mill says  is to suggest hypotheses as to the cause  which
must then be used  if possible  experimentally to try if it produces the
given effect  a bacillus  for example  being always found with a certain
disease  is probably the chief condition of it  give it to a guinea pig 
and observe whether the disease appears in that animal 

men often use arguments which  if they knew it  might be shown to
conform more or less to this canon  for they collect many instances to
show that two events are connected  but usually neglect to bring out the
negative side of the proof  so that their arguments only amount to
simple enumeration  thus ascham in his  toxophilus   insisting on the
national importance of archery  argues that victory has always depended
on superiority in shooting  and  to prove it  he shows how the parthians
checked the romans  sesostris conquered a great part of the known world 
tiberius overcame arminius  the turks established their empire  and the
english defeated the french  with many like examples   all by superior
archery  but having cited these cases to his purpose  he is content 
whereas he might have greatly strengthened his proof by showing how one
or the other instance excludes other possible causes of success  thus 
the cause was not discipline  for the romans were better disciplined
than the parthians  nor yet the boasted superiority of a northern
habitat  for sesostris issued from the south  nor better manhood  for
here the germans probably had the advantage of the romans  nor superior
civilisation  for the turks were less civilised than most of those they
conquered  nor numbers  nor even a good cause  for the french were more
numerous than the english  and were shamefully attacked by henry v  on
their own soil  many an argument from simple enumeration may thus be
turned into an induction of greater plausibility according to the canon
of agreement 

still  in the above case  the effect  victory  is so vaguely conceived 
that a plurality of causes must be allowed for  although  e g  
discipline did not enable the romans to conquer the parthians  it may
have been their chief advantage over the germans  and it was certainly
important to the english under henry v  in their war with the french 

here is another argument  somewhat similar to the above  put forward by
h  spencer with a full consciousness of its logical character  states
that make war their chief object  he says  assume a certain type of
organisation  involving the growth of the warrior class and the
treatment of labourers as existing solely to sustain the warriors  the
complete subordination of individuals to the will of the despotic
soldier king  their property  liberty and life being at the service of
the state  the regimentation of society not only for military but also
for civil purposes  the suppression of all private associations  etc 
this is the case in dahomey and in russia  and it was so at sparta  in
egypt  and in the empire of the yncas  but the similarity of
organisation in these states cannot have been due to race  for they are
all of different races  nor to size  for some are small  some large  nor
to climate or other circumstances of habitat  for here again they differ
widely  the one thing they have in common is the military purpose  and
this  therefore  must be the cause of their similar organisation 
  political institutions   

by this method  then  to prove that one thing is causally connected with
another  say a with  p   we show  first  that in all instances of  p   a
is present  and  secondly  that any other supposable cause of  p  may be
absent without disturbing  p   we next come to a method the use of which
greatly strengthens the foregoing  by showing that where  p  is absent
a is also absent  and  if possible  that a is the only supposable cause
that is always absent along with  p  


  2  the canon of the joint method of agreement in presence and in
absence 

 if   1   two or more instances in which a phenomenon occurs have only
one other circumstance  antecedent or consequent  in common  while   2 
 two or more instances in which it does not occur  though in important
points they resemble the former set of instances  have nothing else in
common save the absence of that circumstance  the circumstance in which
alone the two sets of instances differ throughout  being present in the
first set and absent in the second  is probably the effect  or the
cause  or an indispensable condition of the phenomenon  

the first clause of this canon is the same as that of the method of
agreement  and its significance depends upon the same propositions
concerning causation  the second clause  relating to instances in which
the phenomenon is absent  depends for its probative force upon prop  ii 
 a   and i   b   its function is to exclude certain circumstances  whose
nature or manner of occurrence gives them some claim to consideration 
from the list of possible causes  or effects  of the phenomenon
investigated  it might have been better to state this second clause
separately as the canon of the method of exclusions 

to prove that a is causally related to  p   let the two sets of
instances be represented as follows 

instances of presence      instances of absence 
        a b c                       c h f
        p q r                       r x v 
        a d e                       b d k
        p s t                       q y s 
        a f g                       e g m
        p u v                       t f u 

then a is probably the cause or a condition of  p   or  p  is dependent
upon a  first  by the canon of agreement in presence  as represented by
the first set of instances  and  secondly  by agreement in absence in
the second set of instances  for there we see that c  h  f  b  d  k  e 
g  m occur without the phenomenon  p   and therefore  by prop  ii   a  
are not its cause  or not the whole cause  unless they have been
counteracted  which is a point for further investigation   we also see
that  r  v  q  s  t  u  occur without a  and therefore are not the
effects of a  and  further  if the negative instances represent all
possible cases  we see that  according to prop  i   b   a is the cause
of  p   because it cannot be omitted without the cessation of  p   the
inference that a and  p  are cause and effect  suggested by their being
present throughout the first set of instances  is therefore strengthened
by their being both absent throughout the second set 

so far as this double method  like the single method of agreement 
relies on observation  sequence may not be perceptible in the instances
observed  and then  direct causation cannot be proved by it  but only
the probability of causal connection  and  again  the real cause  though
present  may be so obscure as to evade observation  it has  however  one
peculiar advantage  namely  that if the second list of instances  in
which the phenomenon and its supposed antecedent are both absent  can be
made exhaustive  it precludes any hypothesis of a plurality of causes 
since all possible antecedents will have been included in this list
without producing the phenomenon  thus  in the above symbolic example 
taking the first set of instances  the supposition is left open that b 
c  d  e  f  g may  at one time or another  have been a condition of  p  
but  in the second list  these antecedents all occur  here or there 
without producing  p   and therefore  unless counteracted somehow 
cannot be a condition of  p   a  then  stands out as the one thing that
is present whenever  p  is present  and absent whenever  p  is absent 

stated in this abstract way  the double method may seem very elaborate
and difficult  yet  in fact  its use may be very simple  tyndall  to
prove that dispersed light in the air is due to motes  showed by a
number of cases  1  that any gas containing motes is luminous   2  that
air in which the motes had been destroyed by heat  and any gas so
prepared as to exclude motes  are not luminous  all the instances are of
gases  and the result is  motes  luminosity  no motes  no luminosity 
darwin  to show that cross fertilisation is favourable to flowers 
placed a net about 100 flower heads  and left 100 others of the same
varieties exposed to the bees  the former bore no seed  the latter
nearly 3 000  we must assume that  in darwin s judgment  the net did not
screen the flowers from light and heat sufficiently to affect the
result 

there are instructive applications of this double method in wallace s
 darwinism   in chap  viii   on  colour in animals   he observes  that
the usefulness of their coloration to animals is shown by the fact that 
 as a rule  colour and marking are constant in each species of wild
animal  while  in almost every domesticated animal  there arises great
variability  we see this in our horses and cattle  our dogs and cats 
our pigeons and poultry  now the essential difference between the
conditions of life of domesticated and wild animals is  that the former
are protected by man  while the latter have to protect themselves   wild
animals protect themselves by acquiring qualities adapted to their mode
of life  and coloration is a very important one  its chief  though not
its only use  being concealment  hence a useful coloration having been
established in any species  individuals that occasionally may vary from
it  will generally  perish  whilst  among domestic animals  variation of
colour or marking is subject to no check except the taste of owners  we
have  then  two lists of instances  first  innumerable species of wild
animals in which the coloration is constant and which depend upon their
own qualities for existence  secondly  several species of domestic
animals in which the coloration is  not  constant  and which do  not 
depend upon their own qualities for existence  in the former list two
circumstances are present together  under all sorts of conditions   in
the latter they are absent together  the argument may be further
strengthened by adding a third list  parallel to the first  comprising
domestic animals in which coloration is approximately constant  but
where  as we know  it is made a condition of existence by owners  who
only breed from those specimens that come up to a certain standard of
coloration 

wallace goes on to discuss the colouring of arctic animals  in the
arctic regions  he says  some animals are wholly white all the year
round  such as the polar bear  the american polar hare  the snowy owl
and the greenland falcon  these live amidst almost perpetual snow 
others  that live where the snow melts in summer  only turn white in
winter  such as the arctic hare  the arctic fox  the ermine and the
ptarmigan  in all these cases the white colouring is useful  concealing
the herbivores from their enemies  and also the carnivores in
approaching their prey  this usefulness  therefore  is a condition of
the white colouring  two other explanations have  however  been
suggested  first  that the prevalent white of the arctic regions
directly colours the animals  either by some photographic or chemical
action on the skin  or by a reflex action through vision  as in the
chameleon   secondly  that a white skin checks radiation and keeps the
animals warm  but there are some exceptions to the rule of white
colouring in arctic animals which refute these hypotheses  and confirm
the author s  the sable remains brown throughout the winter  but it
frequents trees  with whose bark its colour assimilates  the musk sheep
is brown and conspicuous  but it is gregarious  and its safety depends
upon its ability to recognise its kind and keep with the herd  the raven
is always black  but it fears no enemy and feeds on carrion  and
therefore does not need concealment for either defence or attack  the
colour of the sable  then  though not white  serves for concealment  the
colour of the musk sheep serves a purpose more important than
concealment  the raven needs no concealment  there are thus two sets of
instances   in one set the animals are white  a  all the year   b  in
winter  and white conceals them  a  all the year   b  in winter  in the
other set  the animals are  not  white  and to them either whiteness
would  not  give concealment  or concealment would  not  be
advantageous  and this second list refutes the rival hypotheses  for the
sable  the musk sheep and the raven are as much exposed to the glare of
the snow  and to the cold  as the other animals are 


  3  the canon of difference 

 if an instance in which a phenomenon occurs  and an instance in which
it does not occur  have every other circumstance in common save one 
that one  whether consequent or antecedent  occurring only in the
former  the circumstance in which alone the two instances differ is the
effect  or the cause  or an indispensable condition of the phenomenon  

this follows from props  i  a  and  b   in chapter xv    7  to prove
that a is a condition of  p   let two instances  such as the canon
requires  be represented thus 

     a b c                          b c
     p q r                          q r 

then a is the cause or a condition of  p   for  in the first instance  a
being introduced  without further change    p  arises  prop  i   a   
and  in the second instance  a having been removed  without other
change    p  disappears  prop  i   b    similarly we may prove  by the
same instances  that  p  is the effect of a 

the order of the phenomena and the immediacy of their connection is a
matter for observation  aided by whatever instruments and methods of
inspection and measurement may be available 

as to the invariability of the connection  it may of course be tested by
collecting more instances or making more experiments  but it has been
maintained  that a single perfect experiment according to this method is
sufficient to prove causation  and therefore implies invariability
 since causation is uniform   though no other instances should ever be
obtainable  because it establishes once for all the unconditionality of
the connection

     a b c
     p q r  

now  formally this is true  but in any actual investigation how shall we
decide what is a satisfactory or perfect experiment  such an experiment
requires that in the negative instance

     b c
     q r  

bc shall be the least assemblage of conditions necessary to co operate
with a in producing  p   and that it is so cannot be ascertained without
either general prior knowledge of the nature of the case or special
experiments for the purpose  so that invariability will not really be
inferred from a single experiment  besides that every prudent inquirer
repeats his experiments  if only to guard against his own liability to
error 

the supposed plurality of causes does not affect the method of
difference  in the above symbolic case  a is clearly  one  cause  or
condition  of  p   whatever other causes may be possible  whereas with
the single method of agreement  it remained doubtful  admitting a
plurality of causes  whether a  in spite of being always present with
 p   was ever a cause or condition of it 

this method of difference without our being distinctly aware of it  is
oftener than any other the basis of ordinary judgments  that the sun
gives light and heat  that food nourishes and fire burns  that a stone
breaks a window or kills a bird  that the turning of a tap permits or
checks the flow of water or of gas  and thousands of other propositions
are known to be true by rough but often emphatic applications of this
method in common experience 

the method of difference may be applied either  1  by observation  on
finding two instances  distinct assemblages of conditions  differing
only in one phenomenon together with its antecedent or consequent  or
 2  by experiment  and then  either  a  by preparing two instances that
may be compared side by side  or  b  by taking certain conditions  and
then introducing  or subtracting  some agent  supposed to be the cause 
to see what happens  in the latter case the  two instances  are the same
assemblage of conditions considered before and  again  after  the
introduction of the agent  as an example of  a  there is an experiment
to show that radium gives off heat  take two glass tubes  in one put
some chloride of radium  in both thermometers  and close them with
cotton wool  soon the thermometer in the tube along with radium reads
54¬∞ f  higher than the other one  the tube without the radium  whose
temperature remains unaltered  is called the  control  experiment  most
experiments are of the type  b   and since the canon  which describes
two co existing instances  does not readily apply to this type  an
alternative version may be offered   any agent whose introduction into
known circumstances  without further change  is immediately followed by
a definite phenomenon is a condition of the occurrence of that
phenomenon  

the words  into known circumstances  are necessary to emphasise what is
required by this method  namely  that the two instances differ in only
one thing  for this cannot be ascertained unless all the other
conditions are known  and this further implies that they have been
prepared  it is  therefore  not true  as sigwart asserts  that this
method determines only one condition of a phenomenon  and that it is
then necessary to inquire into the other conditions  if they were not
known they must be investigated  but then the experiment would not have
been made upon this method  practically  experiments have to be made in
all degrees of imperfection  and the less perfect they are  that is  the
less the circumstances are known beforehand  the more remains to be
done  a common imperfection is delay  or the occurrence of a latent
period between the introduction of an agent and the manifestation of its
effects  it cannot then be the unconditional cause  though it may be an
indispensable remote condition of whatever change occurs  if  feeling
out of sorts  you take a drug and some time afterwards feel better  it
is not clear on this ground alone that the drug was the cause of
recovery  for other curative processes may have been active
meanwhile  food  or sleep  or exercise 

any book of physics or of chemistry will furnish scores of examples of
the method of difference  such as galileo s experiment to show that air
has weight  by first weighing a vessel filled with ordinary air  and
then filling it with condensed air and weighing it again  when the
increased weight can only be due to the greater quantity of air
contained  the melting point of solids is determined by heating them
until they do melt  as silver at 1000¬∞ c   gold at 1250¬∞  platinum at
2000¬∞   for the only difference between bodies at the time of melting
and just before is the addition of so much heat  similarly with the
boiling point of liquids  that the transmission of sound depends upon
the continuity of an elastic ponderable medium  is proved by letting a
clock strike in a vacuum  under a glass from which the air has been
withdrawn by an air pump   and standing upon a non elastic pedestal 
when the clock be seen to strike  but makes only such a faint sound as
may be due to the imperfections of the vacuum and the pedestal 

the experiments by which the chemical analysis or synthesis of various
forms of matter is demonstrated are simple or compound applications of
this method of difference  together with the quantitative mark of
causation  that cause and effect are equal   since the bodies resulting
from an analysis are equal in weight to the body analysed  and the body
resulting from a synthesis is equal in weight to the bodies synthesised 
that an electric current resolves water into oxygen and hydrogen may be
proved by inserting the poles of a galvanic battery in a vessel of
water  when this one change is followed by another  the rise of bubbles
from each pole and the very gradual decrease of the water  if the
bubbles are caught in receivers placed over them  it can be shown that
the joint weight of the two bodies of gas thus formed is equal to the
weight of the water that has disappeared  and that the gases are
respectively oxygen and hydrogen may then be shown by proving that they
have the properties of those gases according to further experiments by
the method of difference  as  e g   that one of them is oxygen because
it supports combustion  etc 

when water was first decomposed by the electric current  there appeared
not only oxygen and hydrogen  but also an acid and an alkali  these
products were afterwards traced to impurities of the water and of the
operator s hands  mill observes that in any experiment the effect  or
part of it  may be due  not to the supposed agent  but to the means
employed in introducing it  we should know not only the other conditions
of an experiment  but that the agent or change introduced is nothing
else than what it is supposed to be 

in the more complex sciences the method of difference is less easily
applicable  because of the greater difficulty of being sure that only
one circumstance at a time has altered  still  it is frequently used 
thus  if by dividing a certain nerve certain muscles are paralysed  it
is shown that normally that nerve controls those muscles  that the sense
of smell in flies and cockroaches is connected with the antennae has
been shown by cutting them off  whereupon the insects can no longer find
carrion  in his work on  earthworms   darwin shows that  though
sensitive to mechanical tremors  they are deaf  or  at least  not
sensitive to sonorous vibrations transmitted through the air   by the
following experiment  he placed a pot containing a worm that had come to
the surface  as usual at night  upon a table  whilst close by a piano
was violently played  but the worm took no notice of the noise  he then
placed the pot upon the piano  whilst it was being played  when the
worm  probably feeling mechanical vibrations  hastily slid back into its
burrow 

when  instead of altering one circumstance in an instance  which we have
done our best not otherwise to disturb  and then watching what follows 
we try to find two ready made instances of a phenomenon  which only
differ in one other circumstance  it is  of course  still more difficult
to be sure that there is only one other circumstance in which they
differ  it may be worth while  however  to look for such instances 
thus  that the temperature of ocean currents influences the climate of
the shores they wash  seems to be shown by the fact that the average
temperature of newfoundland is lower than that of the norwegian coast
some 15¬∞ farther north  both regions have great continents at their
back  and as the mountains of norway are higher and capped with
perennial snow  we might expect a colder climate there  but the shore of
norway is visited by the gulf stream  whilst the shore of newfoundland
is traversed by a cold current from greenland  again  when in 1841 the
railway from rouen to paris was being built  gangs of english and gangs
of french workmen were employed upon it  and the english got through
about one third more work per man than the french  it was suspected that
this difference was due to one other difference  namely  that the
english fed better  preferring beef to thin soup  now  logically  it
might have been objected that the evidence was unsatisfactory  seeing
that the men differed in other things besides diet  in  race   say  
which explains so much and so easily  but the frenchmen  having been
induced to try the same diet as the english  were  in a few days  able
to do as much work  so that the  two instances  were better than they
looked  it often happens that evidence  though logically questionable 
is good when used by experts  whose familiarity with the subject makes
it good 


  4  the canon of concomitant variations 

 whatever phenomenon varies in any manner whenever another phenomenon
 consequent or antecedent  varies in some particular manner  no other
change having concurred  is either the cause or effect of that
phenomenon  or is connected with it through some fact of causation   

this is not an entirely fresh method  but may be regarded as a special
case either of agreement or of difference  to prove the cause or effect 
not of a phenomenon as a whole  but of some increment of it  positive or
negative   there are certain forces  such as gravitation  heat 
friction  that can never be eliminated altogether  and therefore can
only be studied in their degrees  to such phenomena the method of
difference cannot be applied  because there are no negative instances 
but we may obtain negative instances of a given quantity of such a
phenomenon  say  heat   and may apply the method of difference to that
quantity  thus  if the heat of a body increases 10 degrees  from 60 to
70  the former temperature of 60 was a negative instance in respect of
those 10 degrees  and if only one other circumstance  say  friction 
has altered at the same time  that circumstance  if an antecedent  is
the cause  accordingly  if in the above canon we insert  after
 particular manner     no other change having concurred    it is a
statement of the method of difference as applicable to the increment of
a phenomenon  instead of to the phenomenon as a whole  and we may then
omit the last clause    or is connected  etc     for these words are
inserted to provide for the case of co effects of a common cause  such
as the flash and report of a gun   but if no other change  such as the
discharge of a gun  has concurred with the variations of two phenomena 
there cannot have been a common cause  and they are therefore cause and
effect 

if  on the other hand  we omit the clause   no other change having
concurred    the canon is a statement of the method of agreement as
applicable to the increment of a phenomenon instead of to the phenomenon
as a whole  and it is then subject to the imperfections of that method 
that is to say  it leaves open the possibilities  that an inquirer may
overlook a plurality of causes  or may mistake a connection of two
phenomena  which  like the flash and report of a gun  are co effects of
a common cause  for a direct relation of cause and effect 

it may occur to the reader that we ought also to distinguish qualitative
and quantitative variations as two orders of phenomena to which the
present method is applicable  but  in fact  qualitative variations may
be adequately dealt with by the foregoing methods of agreement  double
agreement  and difference  because a change of quality or property
entirely gets rid of the former phase of that quality  or substitutes
one for another  as when the ptarmigan changes from brown to white in
winter  or as when a stag grows and sheds its antlers with the course of
the seasons  the peculiar use of the method of variations  however  is
to formulate the conditions of proof in respect of those causes or
effects which cannot be entirely got rid of  but can be obtained only in
greater or less amount  and such phenomena are or course  quantitative 

even when there are two parallel series of phenomena the one
quantitative and the other qualitative  like the rate of air vibration
and the pitch of sound  or the rate of ether vibration and the
colour series of the spectrum  the method of variations is not
applicable  for  1  two such series cannot be said to vary together 
since the qualitative variations are heterogeneous  512  576 is a
definite ratio  but the corresponding notes  c  d  in the treble clef 
present only a difference  hence  2  the correspondence of each note
with each number is a distinct fact  each octave even is a distinct
fact  there is a difference between c 64 and c 128 that could never have
been anticipated without the appropriate experience  there is 
therefore  no such law of these parallel series as there is for
temperature and change of volume  say  in mercury  similar remarks apply
to the physical and sensitive light series 

we may illustrate the two cases of the method thus  putting a dash
against any letter  a  or  p    to signify an increase or decrease of
the phenomenon the letter stands for   agreement in variations  other
changes being admissible   

     a b c           a  d e            a   f g
     p q r           p  s t            p   u v 

here the accompanying phenomena   b c q r  d e s t  f g u v   change
from time to time  and the one thing in which the instances agree
throughout is that any increase of a  a  or a    is followed or
accompanied by an increase of  p  p  or p      whence it is argued that
a is the cause of  p   according to prop  iii   a   ch  xv    7   still 
it is supposable that  in the second instance  d or e may be the cause
of the increment of  p   and that  in the third instance  f or g may be
its cause  though the probability of such vicarious causation decreases
rapidly with the increase of instances in which a and  p  vary together 
and  since an actual investigation of this type must rely on
observation  it is further possible that some undiscovered cause  x  is
the real determinant of both a and  p  and of their concomitant
variations 

professor ferri  in his  criminal sociology   observes   i have shown
that in france there is a manifest correspondence of increase and
decrease between the number of homicides  assaults and malicious
wounding  and the more or less abundant vintage  especially in the years
of extraordinary variations  whether of failure of the vintage  1853 5 
1859  1867  1873  1878 80   attended by a remarkable diminution of crime
 assaults and wounding   or of abundant vintages  1850  1856 8  1862 3 
1865  1868  1874 5   attended by an increase of crime   p  117  eng 
trans    and earlier he had remarked that such crimes also  in their
oscillations from month to month display a characteristic increase
during the vintage periods  from june to december  notwithstanding the
constant diminution of other offences   p  77   this is necessarily an
appeal to the canon of concomitant variations  because france is never
without her annual vintage  nor yet without her annual statistics of
crime  still  it is an argument whose cogency is only that of agreement 
showing that probably the abuse of the vintage is a cause of crimes of
violence  but leaving open the supposition  that some other circumstance
or circumstances  arising or varying from year to year  may determine
the increase or decrease of crime  or that there is some unconsidered
agent which affects both the vintage and crimes of violence  french
sunshine  it might be urged  whilst it matures the generous grape  also
excites a morbid fermentation in the human mind 

difference in variations may be symbolically represented thus  no other
change having concurred  

     a b      a  b      a   b
     p q      p  q      p   q  

here the accompanying phenomena are always the same b/q  and the only
point in which the successive instances differ is in the increments of a
 a   a    followed by corresponding increments of  p    p   p      hence
the increment of a is the cause of the increment of  p  

for examples of the application of this method  the reader should refer
to some work of exact science  he will find in deschanel s  natural
philosophy   c  32  an account of some experiments by which the
connection between heat and mechanical work has been established  it is
there shown that  whenever work is performed by the agency of heat   as
in driving an engine    an amount of heat disappears equivalent to the
work performed  and whenever mechanical work is spent in generating
heat   as in rubbing two sticks together    the heat generated is
equivalent to the work thus spent   and an experiment of joule s is
described  which consisted in fixing a rod with paddles in a vessel of
water  and making it revolve and agitate the water by means of a string
wound round the rod  passed over a pulley and attached to a weight that
was allowed to fall  the descent of the weight was measured by a
graduated rule  and the rise of the water s temperature by a
thermometer   it was found that the heat communicated to the water by
the agitation amounted to one pound degree fahrenheit for every 772
foot pounds of work  expended by the falling weight  as no other
material change seems to take place during such an experiment  it shows
that the progressive expenditure of mechanical energy is the cause of
the progressive heating of the water 

the thermometer itself illustrates this method  it has been found that
the application of heat to mercury expands it according to a law  and
hence the volume of the mercury  measured by a graduated index  is used
to indicate the temperature of the air  water  animal body  etc   in
which the thermometer is immersed  or with which it is brought into
contact  in such cases  if no other change has taken place  the heat of
the air  water  or body is the cause of the rise of the mercury in its
tube  if some other substance  say spirit  be substituted for mercury in
constructing a thermometer  it serves the same purpose  provided the
index be graduated according to the law of the expansion of that
substance by heat  as experimentally determined 

instances of phenomena that do not vary together indicate the exclusion
of a supposed cause  by prop  iii  c    the stature of the human race
has been supposed to depend on temperature  but there is no
correspondence  the  not varying together   however  must not be
confused with  varying inversely   which when regular indicates a true
concomitance  it is often a matter of convenience whether we regard
concomitant phenomena as varying directly or inversely  it is usual to
say   the greater the friction the less the speed   but it is really
more intelligible to say   the greater the friction the more rapidly
molar is converted into molecular motion  

the graphic method exhibits concomitant variations to the eye  and is
extensively used in physical and statistical inquiries  along a
horizontal line  the abscissa  is measured one of the conditions  or
agents  with which the inquiry is concerned  called the variable  and
along perpendiculars  ordinates  is measured some phenomenon to be
compared with it  called the variant 

thus  the expansion of a liquid by heat may be represented by measuring
degrees of temperature along the horizontal  and the expansion of a
column of the liquids in units of length along the perpendicular 

 illustration  fig  9  

in the next diagram  fig  10   reduced from one given by mr  c h  denyer
in an article on the price of tea   economic journal   no  9   the
condition measured horizontally is time  and  vertically  three variants
are measured simultaneously  so that their relations to one another from
time to time may be seen at a glance  from this it is evident that  as
the duty on tea falls  the price of tea falls  whilst the consumption of
tea rises  and  in spite of some irregularity of correspondence in the
courses of the three phenomena  their general causal connection can
hardly be mistaken  however  the causal connection may also be inferred
by general reasoning  the statistical induction can be confirmed by a
deduction  thus illustrating the combined method of proof to be
discussed in the next chapter  without such confirmation the proof by
concomitant variations would not be complete  because  from the
complexity of the circumstances  social statistics can only yield
evidence according to the method of agreement in variations  for 
besides the agents that are measured  there may always be some other
important influence at work  during the last fifty years  for example 
crime has decreased whilst education has increased  true  but at the
same time wages have risen and many other things have happened 

 illustration  fig  10  

it will be noticed that in the diagram the three lines  especially those
of price and consumption  which may be considered  natural  resultants 
in contrast with the arbitrary fixation of a tax   do not depart widely
from regular curves  and accordingly  assuming the causes at work to
vary continuously during the intervals between points of measurement 
curves may be substituted  in fact  a curve often represents the course
of a phenomenon more truthfully than can be done by a line that zigzags
along the exact measurements  because it is less influenced by temporary
and extraordinary causes that may obscure the operation of those that
are being investigated  on the other hand  the abrupt deviations of a
punctilious zigzag may have their own logical value  as will appear in
the next section 

in working with the method of variations one must allow for the
occurrence in a series of  critical points   at which sudden and
sometimes heterogeneous changes may take place  every substance exists
at different temperatures in three states  gaseous  liquid  solid  and
when the change takes place  from one state to another  the series of
variations is broken  water  e g   follows the general law that
cooling is accompanied by decrease of volume between 212¬∞ and 39¬∞ f  
but above 212¬∞  undergoes a sudden expansion in becoming a gas  and
below 39¬∞ begins to expand  until at 32¬∞ the expansion is considerable
on its becoming solid  this illustrates a common experience that
concomitant variations are most regular in the  median range   and are
apt to become irregular at the extremities of the series  where new
conditions begin to operate 

the canon of variations  again  deals not with sudden irruptions of a
cause  force or agent  but with some increase or decrease of an agent
already present  and a corresponding increase or decrease of some other
phenomenon  say an increase of tax and a rise of price  but there are
cases in which the energy of a cause is not immediately discharged and
dissipated  whilst a tax of 6 d   per lb  on tea raises the price per
lb  by about 6 d    however long it lasts  the continuous application of
friction to a body may gradually raise its temperature to the point of
combustion  because heat is received faster than it is radiated  and
therefore accumulates  such cases are treated by mill under the title of
 progressive effects    logic   b  iii   c  15   he gives as an example
of it the acceleration of falling bodies  the storage of effects is a
fact of the utmost importance in all departments of nature  and is
especially interesting in biology and sociology  where it is met with as
heredity  experience  tradition  evolution of species of plants and
animals would  so far as we know  be impossible  if the changes  however
caused  that adapt some individuals better than others to the conditions
of life were not inherited by  and accumulated in  their posterity  the
eyes in the peacock s tail are supposed to have reached their present
perfection gradually  through various stages that may be illustrated by
the ocelli in the wings of the argus pheasant and other genera of
 phasianid√¶   similarly the progress of societies would be impossible
without tradition  whereby the improvements made in any generation may
be passed on to the next  and the experience of mankind may be gradually
accumulated in various forms of culture  the earliest remains of culture
are flint implements and weapons  in which we can trace the effect of
tradition in the lives of our remote forefathers  as they slowly through
thousands of years learnt to improve the chipping of flints  until the
first rudely shaped lumps gave place to works of unmistakable design 
and these to the beautiful weapons contemporary with the bronze age 

the method of gradations  the arranging of any phenomena to be studied
in series  according to the degree in which some character is exhibited 
is  perhaps  the most definite device in the art of discovery   bain 
 induction   c  6  and app  ii   if the causes are unknown it is likely
to suggest hypotheses  and if the causes are partly known  variation in
the character of the series is likely to indicate a corresponding
variation of the conditions 


  5  the canon of residues 

 subduct from any phenomenon such part as previous inductions have shown
to be the effect of certain antecedents  and the residue of the
phenomenon is the effect of the remaining antecedents  

the phenomenon is here assumed to be an effect  a similar canon may be
framed for residuary causes 

this also is not a fresh method  but a special case of the method of
difference  for if we suppose the phenomenon to be  p q r   and the
antecedent to be a b c  and that we already know b and c to have  either
severally or together  the consequents  q r   in which their efficacy is
exhausted  we may regard

 b c
 q r 

as an instance of the absence of  p  obtained deductively from the whole
phenomenon

 a b c
 p q r 

by our knowledge of the laws of b and c  so that

 a b c
 p q r 

is an instance of the presence of  p   differing otherwise from

 b c
 q r 

in nothing except that a is also present  by the canon of difference 
therefore a is the cause of  p   or  again  when phenomena thus treated
are strictly quantitative  the method may be based on prop  iii   b  
ch  xv    7 

of course  if a can be obtained apart from b c and directly experimented
with so as to produce  p   so much the better  and this may often be
done  but the special value of the method of residues appears  when some
complex phenomenon has been for the most part accounted for by known
causes  whilst there remains some excess  or shortcoming  or deviation
from the result which those causes alone would lead us to expect  and
this residuary fact has to be explained in relation to the whole  here
the negative instance is constituted by deduction  showing what would
happen but for the interference of some unknown cause which is to be
investigated  and this prominence of the deductive process has led some
writers to class the method as deductive  but we have seen that all the
canons involve deduction  and  considering how much in every experiment
is assumed as already known  what circumstances are  material   and when
conditions may be called  the same    the wonder is that no one has
insisted upon regarding every method as concerned with residues  in
fact  as scientific explanation progresses  the phenomena that may be
considered as residuary become more numerous and the importance of this
method increases 

examples  the recorded dates of ancient eclipses having been found to
differ from those assigned by calculation  it appears that the average
length of a day has in the meanwhile increased  this is a residuary
phenomenon not accounted for by the causes formerly recognised as
determining the rotation of the earth on its axis  and it may be
explained by the consideration that the friction of the tides reduces
the rate of the earth s rotation  and thereby lengthens the day 
astronomy abounds in examples of the method of residues  of which the
discovery of neptune is the most famous 

capillarity seems to be a striking exception to the principle that water
 or any liquid   finds its level   that being the condition of
equilibrium  yet capillarity proves to be only a refined case of
equilibrium when account is taken of the forces of adhesion exerted by
different kinds of bodies in contact 

 many of the new elements of chemistry   says herschel   have been
detected in the investigation of residual phenomena   thus  lord
rayleigh and sir w  ramsay found that nitrogen from the atmosphere was
slightly heavier than nitrogen got from chemical sources  and  seeking
the cause of this difference  discovered argon 

the economist shows that when a country imports goods the chief means of
paying for them is to export other goods  if this were all  imports and
exports would be of equal value  yet the united kingdom imports about
¬£400 000 000 annually  and exports about ¬£300 000 000  here  then  is a
residuary phenomenon of ¬£100 000 000 to be accounted for  but foreign
countries owe us about ¬£50 000 000 for the use of shipping  and
¬£70 000 000 as interest on the capital we have lent them  and
¬£15 000 000 in commissions upon business transacted for them  these sums
added together amount to ¬£135 000 000  and that is ¬£35 000 000 too much 
thus another residuary phenomenon emerges  for whilst foreigners seem to
owe us ¬£435 000 000 they only send us ¬£400 000 000 of imports  these
¬£35 000 000 are accounted for by the annual investment of our capital
abroad  in return for which no immediate payment is due  and  these
being omitted  exports and imports balance  since this was written the
figures of our foreign trade have greatly risen  but the character of
the explanation remains the same 

when  in pursuing the method of variations  the phenomena compared do
not always correspond in their fluctuations  the irregular movements of
that phenomenon which we regard as the effect may often be explained by
treating them as residuary phenomena  and then seeking for exceptional
causes  whose temporary interference has obscured the influence of the
general cause  thus  returning to the diagram of the price of tea in  
4  it is clear that generally the price falls as the duty falls  but in
mr  denyer s more minutely wrought diagram  from which this is reduced 
it may be seen that in 1840 the price of tea rose from 3 s   9 d   to
4 s   9 d   without any increase of duty  this  however  is readily
explained by the chinese war of that year  which checked the supply 
again  from 1869 to 1889 the duty was constant  whilst the price of tea
fell as much as 8 d   per lb   but this residuary phenomenon is
explained by the prodigiously increased production of tea during that
period in india and ceylon 

the above examples of the method of residues are all quantitative  but
the method is often employed where exact estimates are unobtainable 
thus darwin  having found certain modifications of animals in form 
coloration and habits  that were not clearly derivable from their
struggle for existence in relation to other species or to external
conditions  suggested that they were due to sexual selection 

the  vestiges  and  survivals  so common in biology and sociology are
residuary phenomena  it is a general inference from the doctrine of
natural selection that every organ of a plant  animal  or society is in
some way useful to it  there occur  however  organs that have at present
no assignable utility  are at least wasteful  and sometimes even
injurious  and the explanation is that formerly they were useful  but
that  their uses having lapsed  they are now retained by the force of
heredity or tradition  either they are not injurious enough to be
eliminated by natural selection  or they are correlated with other
organs  whose utility outweighs their disutility 




chapter xvii

combination of induction with deduction


  1  we have now reviewed mill s five canons of inductive proof  at
bottom  as he observes  there are only two  namely  agreement and
difference  since the double method  variations and residues are only
special forms of the other two  indeed  in their function of  proof  
they are all reducible to one  namely  difference  for the cogency of
the method of agreement  as distinguished from a simple enumeration of
instances agreeing in the coincidence of a supposed cause and its
effect   depends upon the omission  in one instance after another  of
all other circumstances  which omission is a point of difference 

the canons are an analysis of the conditions of proving directly  where
possible   by means of observation or experiment  any proposition that
predicates causation  but if we say  by means of observation or
experiment   it is not to be understood that these are the only means
and that nothing else is involved  for it has been shown that the law of
causation is itself an indispensable foundation of the evidence  in fact
inductive logic may be considered as having a purely formal character 
it consists  1  in a statement of the law of cause and effect   2  in
certain immediate inferences from this law  expanded into the canons 
 3  in the syllogistic application of the canons to special predications
of causation by means of minor premises  showing that certain instances
satisfy the canons 

at the risk of some pedantry  we may exhibit the process as follows
  cf   prof  ray s  logic   appendix d  

whatever relation of events has certain marks is a case of causation 

    the relation a   p  has some or all of these marks  as shown
    by observation and by the conformity of instances to such or
    such a canon  

therefore  the relation a   p  is a case of causation  now  the
parenthesis   as shown by the conformity  etc    is an adscititious
member of an epicheirema  which may be stated  as a prosyllogism  thus 

    if an instance  etc   canon of difference  

    the instances a b c  b c are of the kind required 
                  p q r  q r 

    therefore  a  present where  p  occurs and absent where it
    does not occur  is an indispensable antecedent of  p  

such is the bare logic of induction  so that  strictly speaking 
observation or experiment is no part of the logic  but a means of
applying the logic to actual  that is  not merely symbolical 
propositions  the formal logic of induction is essentially deductive 
and it has been much questioned whether any transition from the formal
to the material conditions of proof is possible  as long as we are
content to illustrate the canons with symbols  such as a and  p   all
goes well  but can we in any actual investigation show that the relevant
facts or  instances  correspond with those symbols 

in the first place  as dr  venn shows  natural phenomena want the
distinctness and capability of isolation that belong to symbols 
secondly  the observing whether instances conform to a canon  must
always be subject at last to the limits of our faculties  how can we
ascertain exact equality  immediate sequence  the canon of difference 
in its experimental application  is usually considered the most cogent
sort of proof  yet when can the two sequent instances  before and after
the introduction of a certain agent  be said to differ in nothing else 
are not earth and stars always changing position  is not every molecule
in the room and apparatus always oscillating  it is true that our senses
are now aided by elaborate instruments  but the construction of these
depends on scientific theories  which again depend on experiments 

it is right to touch upon this well known sceptical topic  but to insist
much upon it is not a sign of good sense  the works of herschel 
whewell  and jevons should be consulted for the various methods of
correcting observations  by repeating them  averaging them  verifying
one experimental process by another  always refining the methods of
exact measurement  multiplying the opportunities of error  that if any
exist it may at last show itself   and by other devices of what may be
called material logic or methodology  but only direct experience and
personal manipulation of scientific processes  can give a just sense of
their effectiveness  and to stand by  suggesting academic doubts  is
easier and more amusing 

  2  still  it is not so much in laws based upon direct observation or
experiment  that the material validity of scientific reasoning appears 
as in the cumulative evidence that arises from the co ordination of laws
within each science  and the growing harmony and coherence of all
sciences  this requires a more elaborate combination of deduction with
observation and experiment  during the last three hundred years many
departments of science have been reduced under principles of the
greatest generality  such as the conservation of energy  the law of
gravitation  the undulatory theory of light  the law of combining
equivalents  and the theory of natural selection  connecting and
explaining the less general laws  which  again  are said to connect and
explain the facts  meanwhile  those sciences that were the first to make
progress have helped to develop others which  like biology and
sociology  present greater difficulties  and it becomes more and more
apparent that the distinctions drawn among sciences are entirely for the
convenience of study  and that all sciences tend to merge in one
universal science of nature  now  this process of the  unification of
knowledge  is almost another name for deduction  but at the same time it
depends for its reality and solidity upon a constant reference to
observation and experiment  only a very inadequate notion of it can be
given in the ensuing chapters 

we saw in chap  xiv    6  that when two or more agents or forces combine
to produce a phenomenon  their effects are intermixed in it  and this in
one of two ways according to their nature  in chemical action and in
vegetable and animal life  the causal agents concerned are blended in
their results in such a way that most of the qualities which they
exhibited severally are lost  whilst new qualities appear instead  thus
chlorine  a greenish yellow gas  and sodium  a metal  unite to form
common salt nacl  which is quite unlike either of them  a man eats
bread  and it becomes muscle  nerve and bone  in such cases we cannot
trace the qualities of the causal agents in the qualities of the
effects  given such causes  we can prove experimentally  according to
the canons of induction  that they have such effects  but we may not be
able in any new case to calculate what the effects will be 

on the other hand  in astronomy and physics  the causes treated of are
mechanical  at least  it is the aim of physics to attain to a mechanical
conception of phenomena  so that  in every new combination of forces 
the intermixed effect  or resultant  may be calculated beforehand 
provided that the forces concerned admit of being quantitatively
estimated  and that the conditions of their combination are not so
complex as to baffle the powers of mathematicians  in such cases  when
direct observation or experiment is insufficient to resolve an effect
into the laws of its conditions  the general method is to calculate
what may be expected from a combination of its conditions  as either
known or hypothetically assumed  and to compare this anticipation with
the actual phenomenon 

  3  this is what mill calls the direct deductive method  or  the
physical method  because it is so much relied on in treating of light 
heat  sound  etc   it is also the method of astronomy and much used in
economics  deduction leads the way  and its results are tested
inductively by experiments or observations  given any complex mechanical
phenomenon  the inquirer considers   1  what laws already ascertained
seem likely to apply to it  in default of known laws  hypotheses are
substituted   cf   chap  xviii    he then   2  computes the effect that
will follow from these laws in circumstances similar to the case before
him  and  3  he verifies his conclusion by comparing it with the actual
phenomenon 

a simple example of this method is the explanation of the rise of water
in the  common pump   we know three laws applicable to this case   a 
that the atmosphere weighs upon the water outside the pump with a
pressure of 15 lb  to the square inch   b  that a liquid  and therefore
the water  transmits pressure equally in all directions  upwards as well
as downwards and sideways   and  c  that pressure upon a body in any
direction  if not counteracted by an opposite pressure  produces motion 
hence  when the rise of the piston of the pump removes the pressure upon
the water within the cylinder  tending to produce a vacuum there  this
water is pushed up by the pressure of the air upon the water outside the
cylinder  and follows the rising piston  until the column of water
inside the cylinder exerts a pressure equal to that of the atmosphere
upon an equal area  so much for the computation  does it correspond with
the fact  it is found that at the sea level water can be pumped to the
height of 33 ft  and that such a column of water has a pressure of 15
lb  to the square inch  we may show further that  at the sea level 
spirits of wine may be pumped higher according to its less specific
gravity  and that if we attempt to pump water at successive altitudes
above the sea level  we can only raise it to less and less heights 
corresponding with the lessened atmospheric pressure at those altitudes 
where the column of air producing the pressure is shorter  finally  if
we try to work a pump  having first produced a vacuum over the water
outside the cylinder  we shall find that the water inside will not rise
at all  the piston can be raised  but the water does not follow it  the
verification thus shows that the computed effect corresponds with the
phenomenon to be explained  that the result does not depend upon the
nature of water only  but is true  allowing for differences of specific
gravity  of other liquids  that if the pressure of the outside air is
diminished  the height of pumping is so too  canon of variations   and
that if that pressure is entirely removed  pumping becomes impossible
 canon of difference  

any text book of astronomy or physics furnishes numerous illustrations
of the deductive method  take  for example  the first chapter of
deschanel s  optics   where are given three methods of determining the
velocity of light  this was first deduced from observation of jupiter s
satellites  the one nearest the planet passes behind it  or into its
shadow  and is eclipsed  at intervals of about 42 1/2 hours  but it can
be shown that  when jupiter and the earth are nearest together on the
same side of the sun  an eclipse of this satellite is visible from the
earth 16 min  26 6 sec  earlier than when jupiter and the earth are
furthest apart on opposite sides of the sun  16 min  26 6 sec  then  is
the time in which light traverses the diameter of the earth s orbit 
therefore  supposing the earth s distance from the sun to be 92 millions
of miles  light travels about 186 000 miles a second  another deduction 
agreeing with this  starts from the fact of aberration  or the
displacement of the apparent from the actual position of the stars in
the direction of the earth s motion  aberration depends partly on the
velocity of light  partly on the velocity of the earth  and the latter
being known  the former can be computed  now  these two deductive
arguments  verifying each other  have also been verified experimentally 
foucault s experiment to measure the velocity of light is too elaborate
to be described here  a full account of it will be found in the treatise
above cited    687 

when the phenomena to be explained are of such a character  so vast in
extent  power or duration  that it is impossible  in the actual
circumstances of the case  to frame experiments in order to verify a
deductive explanation  it may still be possible to reproduce a similar
phenomenon upon a smaller scale  thus monge s explanation of mirage by
the great heat of the desert sand  which makes the lowest stratum of air
less dense than those above it  so that rays of light from distant
objects are refracted in descending  until they are actually turned
upwards again to the eye of the beholders  giving him inverted images of
the objects as if they were reflected in water  is manifestly incapable
of being verified by experiment in the natural conditions of the
phenomenon  but by heating the bottom of  a sheet iron box  with its
ends cut away   the rarefied air at the bottom of the box may sometimes
be made to yield reflections  and this shows at least that the supposed
cause is a possible one  deschanel   optics     726   similarly as to
the vastest of all phenomena  the evolution of the stellar system  and
of the solar system as part of it  from an immense cloudlike volume of
matter  h  spencer  in his essay on  the nebular hypothesis   says 
amidst a great array of deductive arguments from mechanical principles 
that  this  a priori  reasoning harmonises with the results of
experiment  dr  plateau has shown that when a mass of fluid is  as far
as may be  protected from the action of external forces  it will  if
made to rotate with adequate velocity  form detached rings  and that
these rings will break up into spheroids  which turn on their axes in
the same direction with the central mass   the theory of the evolution
of species of plants and animals by natural selection  again  though  of
course  it cannot be verified by direct experiment  since experiment
implies artificial arrangement   and the process is too slow for
observation  is  nevertheless  to some extent confirmed by the practice
of gardeners and breeders of animals  since  by taking advantage of
accidental variations of form and colour in the plants or animals under
their care  and relying on the inheritability of these variations they
obtain extensive modifications of the original stocks  and adapt them to
the various purposes for which flowers and cereals  poultry  dogs and
cattle are domesticated  this shows  at least  that living forms are
plastic  and extensively modifiable in a comparatively short time 

  4  suppose  however  that  in verifying a deductive argument  the
effect as computed from the laws of the causes assigned  does not
correspond with the facts observed  there must then be an error
somewhere  if the fact has been accurately observed  the error must lie
either in the process of deduction and computation  or else in the
premises  as to the process of deduction  it may be very simple and
easily revised  as in the above explanation of the common pump  or it
may be very involved and comprise long trains of mathematical
calculation  if  however  on re examining the computations  we find them
correct  it remains to look for some mistake in the premises 

 1  we may not have accurately ascertained the laws  or the modes of
operation  or the amounts of the forces present  thus  the rate at which
bodies fall was formerly believed to vary in proportion to their
relative weights  and any estimate based upon this belief cannot agree
with the facts  again  the corpuscular theory of light  namely  that
the physical cause of light is a stream of fine particles projected in
straight lines from the luminous object  though it seemed adequate to
the explanation of many optical phenomena  could not be made to agree
with the facts of interference and double refraction 

 2  the circumstances in which the agents are combined may not have been
correctly conceived  when newton began to inquire whether the attraction
of the earth determined the orbit of the moon  he was at first
disappointed   according to newton s calculations  made at this time  
says whewell   the moon  by her motion in her orbit  was deflected from
the tangent every minute through a space of thirteen feet  but by
noticing the space which bodies would fall in one minute at the earth s
surface  and supposing this to be diminished in the ratio of the inverse
square  it appeared that gravity would  at the moon s orbit  draw a body
through more than fifteen feet   in view of this discrepancy he gave up
the inquiry for sixteen years  until in 1682  having obtained better
data  he successfully renewed it   he had been mistaken in the magnitude
of the earth  and consequently in the distance of the moon  which is
determined by measurements of which the earth s radius is the base   it
was not  therefore  a mistake as to the law or as to the nature of the
forces concerned  namely  the law of the inverse square and the identity
of celestial with terrestrial gravity   but as to the circumstances in
which the agents  earth and moon  were combined  that prevented his
calculations being verified    hist  ind  sc    vii  ii  3  

 3  one or more of the agents affecting the result may have been
overlooked and omitted from the estimate  thus  an attempt to explain
the tides by taking account only of the earth and the moon  will not
entirely agree with the facts  since the sun also influences the tides 
this illustration  however  shows that when the conclusion of a
deductive explanation does not entirely agree with the facts  it is not
always to be inferred that the reasoning is  properly speaking  wrong 
it may be right as far as it goes  and merely inadequate  hence  a  in
such cases an opportunity occurs of applying the method of residues  by
discovering the agent that must be allowed for in order to complete the
explanation  and  b  the investigation of a phenomenon is often
designedly begun upon an imperfect basis for the sake of simplicity  the
result being regarded as a first approximation  to be afterwards
corrected by including  one by one  the remaining agents or
circumstances affecting the phenomenon  until the theory is complete 
that is  until its agreement with the facts is satisfactory 

 4  we may have included among the data of our reasonings agents or
circumstances that do not exist or do not affect the phenomenon in
question  in the early days of science purely fanciful powers were much
relied upon  such as the solid spheres that carried the planets and
stars  the influence of the planets upon human destiny  the tendency of
everything to seek  its own place   so that fire rises to heaven  and
solids fall to the earth  the  plastic virtue  of the soil  which was
once thought to have produced fossils  when  however  such conceptions
hindered the progress of explanation  it was not so much by vitiating
the deductive method as by putting men off from exact inquiries  more to
our present purpose were the supposed cataclysms  or extraordinary
convulsions of the earth  a belief in which long hindered the progress
of geology  again  in biology  psychology  and sociology many
explanations have depended upon the doctrine that any improvement of
structure or faculty acquired by an individual may be inherited by his
descendants  as that  if an animal learns to climb trees  his offspring
have a greater aptitude for that mode of life  that if a man tries to be
good  his children find it easier to be virtuous  that if the
inhabitants of a district carry on cloth work  it becomes easier for
each successive generation to acquire dexterity in that art  but now the
inheritability of powers acquired by the individual through his own
efforts  is disputed  and  if the denial be made good  all such
explanations as the above must be revised 

if  then  the premises of a deductive argument be vitiated in any of
these four ways  its conclusion will fail to agree with the results of
observation and experiment  unless  of course  one kind of error happen
to be cancelled by another that is  equal and opposite   we now come to
a variation of the method of combining induction with deduction  so
important as to require separate treatment 

  5  the inverse or historical method has of late years become
remarkably fruitful  when the forces determining a phenomenon are too
numerous  or too indefinite  to be combined in a direct deduction  we
may begin by collecting an empirical law of the phenomenon  as that  the
democracies of city states are arbitrary and fickle    and then
endeavour to show by deductions from  the nature of the case   that is 
from a consideration of the circumstances and forces known to be
operative  of which  in the above instance  the most important is
sympathetic contagion   that such a law was to be expected  deduction is
thus called in to verify a previous induction  whereas in the  physical
method  a deduction was verified by comparing it with an induction or an
experiment  hence the method now to be discussed has been named the
inverse deductive method 

but although it is true that  in such inquiries as we are now dealing
with  induction generally takes the lead  yet i cannot think that the
mere order in which the two logical processes occur is the essential
distinction between the two ways of combining them  for  in the first
place  in investigations of any complexity both induction and deduction
recur again and again in whatever order may be most convenient  and  in
the second place  the so called  inverse order  is sometimes resorted to
in astronomy and physics  for example  kepler s laws were first
collected empirically from observations of the planetary motions  and
afterwards deduced by newton from the law of gravitation  this  then 
was the inverse method  but the result is something very different from
any that can be obtained by the historical method  the essential
difference between the physical and historical methods is that  in the
former  whether direct or inverse  the deductive process  when complete 
amounts to exact demonstration  whereas  in the latter  the deductions
may consist of qualitative reasonings  and the results are indefinite 
they establish   1  a merely probable connection between the phenomena
according to an empirical law  say  between city democracy and fickle
politics    2  connect this with other historical or social
generalisations  by showing that they all alike flow from the same
causes  namely  from the nature of races of men under certain social and
geographical conditions  and  3  explain why such empirical laws may
fail  according to the differences that prevail among races of men and
among the conditions under which they live  thus  seeing how rapidly
excitement is propagated by the chatter  grimacing  and gesticulation of
townsmen  it is probable enough that the democracy of a city state
should be fickle  and arbitrary  because irresponsible   a similar
phenomenon of panic  sympathetic hope and despair  is exhibited by every
stock exchange  and is not peculiar to political life  and when
political opinion is not manufactured solely in the reverberating
furnace of a city  fickleness ceases to characterise democracy  and  in
fact  is not found in switzerland  or the united states  nor in france
so far as politics  depend upon the peasantry 

this is called the historical method  then  because it is especially
useful in explaining the movements of history  and in verifying the
generalisations of political and social science  we must not  however 
suppose that its use is confined to such studies  only a ridiculous
pedantry would allot to each subject its own method and forbid the use
of any other  as if it were not our capital object to establish truth by
any means  wherever the forces determining a phenomenon are too numerous
or too indefinite to be combined in a deductive demonstration  there the
historical method is likely to be useful  and this seems often to be the
case in geology and biology  as well as in the science of history  or
sociology  and its various subsidiary studies 

consider upon what causes historical events depend  the customs 
character  and opinions of all the people concerned  the organisation of
their government  and the character of their religious institutions  the
development of industry among them  of the military art  of fine art 
literature and science  their relations  commercial  political and
social  with other nations  the physical conditions of climate and
geographical position amidst which they live  hardly an event of
importance occurs in any nation that is not  directly or indirectly 
influenced by every one of these circumstances  and that does not react
upon them  now  from the nature of the canons of direct induction  a
satisfactory employment of them in such a complex and tangled situation
as history presents  is rarely possible  for they all require the actual
or virtual isolation of the phenomenon under investigation  they also
require the greatest attainable immediacy of connection between cause
and effect  whereas the causes of social events may accumulate during
hundreds of years  in collecting empirical laws from history  therefore 
only very rough inductions can be hoped for  and we may have to be
content with simple enumeration  hence the importance of supporting such
laws by deduction from the nature of the case  however faint a
probability of the asserted connection is thereby raised  and this even
if each law is valued merely for its own sake  still more  if anything
worth the name of historical science is to be constructed  must a mere
collection of such empiricisms fail to content us  and the only way to
give them a scientific character is to show deductively their common
dependence upon various combinations of the same causes  yet even those
who profess to employ the historical method often omit the deductive
half of it  and of course  practical politicians  boast of their entire
contentment with what they call  the facts  

sometimes  however  politicians  venturing upon deductive reasoning 
have fallen into the opposite error of omitting to test their results by
any comparison with the facts  arguing from certain  rights of man   or
 interests of classes   or  laws of supply and demand   that this or
that event will happen  or ought to happen  without troubling themselves
to observe whether it does happen or ever has happened  this method of
deduction without any empirical verification  is called by mill the
geometrical  and  plainly  it can be trustworthy only where there is no
actual conflict of forces to be considered  in pure mathematical
reasoning about space  time  and number  provided the premises and the
reasoning be correct  verification by a comparison with the facts may be
needless  because there is no possibility of counteraction  but when we
deal with actual causes  no computation of their effects can be relied
upon without comparing our conclusions with the facts  not even in
astronomy and physics  least of all in politics 

burke  then  has well said that  without the guide and light of sound 
well understood principles all our reasoning in politics  as in
everything else  would be only a confused jumble of particular facts and
details without the means of drawing any sort of theoretical or
practical conclusion   but that  on the other hand  the statesman  who
does not take account of circumstances  infinite and infinitely
combined   is not erroneous  but stark mad  he is metaphysically mad 
  on the petition of the unitarians    there is  or ought to be  no
logical difference between the evidence required by a statesman and that
appealed to by a philosopher  and since  as we have seen  the
combination of principles with circumstances cannot  in solving problems
of social science  be made with the demonstrative precision that belongs
to astronomical and physical investigations  there remains the
historical method as above described 

examples of the empirical laws from which this method begins abound in
histories  newspapers  and political discussions  and are of all shades
of truth or half truth  as that  history consists in the biographies of
great men   in other words  that the movements of society are due to
exceptional personal powers  not to general causes  that at certain
epochs great men occur in groups  that every fine art passes through
periods of development  culmination and decline  that democracies tend
to change into despotisms  that the possession of power  whether by
classes or despots  corrupts the possessor  that  the governments most
distinguished for sustained vigour and abilities have generally been
aristocracies   that  revolutions always begin in hunger   that
civilisation is inimical to individuality  that the civilisation of the
country proceeds from the town  that  the movement of progressive
societies has hitherto been a movement from  status  to  contract 
 i e   from a condition in which the individual s rights and duties
depend on his caste  or position in his family as slave  child  or
patriarch  to a condition in which his rights and duties are largely
determined by the voluntary agreements he enters into    and this last
is treated by h  spencer as one aspect of the law first stated by comte 
that the progress of societies is from the military to the industrial
state 

the deductive process we may illustrate by spencer s explanation of the
co existence in the military state of those specific characters  the
inductive proof of which furnished an illustration of the method of
agreement  ch  xvi    1   the type of the military state involves the
growth of the warrior class  and the treatment of labourers as existing
solely to support the warriors  the complete subordination of all
individuals to the will of the despotic soldier king  their property 
liberty and life being at the service of the state  the regimentation of
society  not only for military  but also for civil purposes  the
suppression of all private associations  etc  now all these
characteristics arise from their utility for the purpose of war  a
utility amounting to necessity if war is the state s chief purpose  for
every purpose is best served when the whole available force co operates
toward it  other things equal  the bigger the army the better  and to
increase it  men must be taken from industry  until only just enough
remain to feed and equip the soldiers  as this arrangement is not to
everybody s taste  there must be despotic control  and this control is
most effective through regimentation by grades of command  private
associations  of course  cannot live openly in such a state  because
they may have wills of their own and are convenient for conspiracy  thus
the induction of characteristics is verified by a deduction of them from
the nature of the case 

  6  the greater indefiniteness of the historical compared with the
physical method  both in its inductions and in its deductions  makes it
even more difficult to work with  it wants much sagacity and more
impartiality  for the demon of party is too much with us  our first care
should be to make the empirical law as nearly true as possible 
collecting as many as we can of the facts which the law is supposed to
generalise  and examining them according to the canons of induction 
with due allowance for the imperfect applicability of those canons to
such complex  unwieldy  and indefinite instances  in the examples of
such laws given above  it is clear that in some cases no pains have been
taken to examine the facts  what is the inductive evidence that
democracies change into despotisms  that revolutions always begin in
hunger  or that civilisation is inimical to individuality  even mill s
often quoted saying   that the governments remarkable in history for
sustained vigour and ability have generally been aristocracies   is
oddly over stated  for if you turn to the passage   rep  gov   chap 
vi    the next sentence tells you that such governments have always been
aristocracies of public functionaries  and the next sentence but one
restricts  apparently  the list of such remarkable governments to
two  rome and venice  whence  then  comes the word  generally  into
mill s law 

as to deducing our empirical law from a consideration of the nature of
the case  it is obvious that we ought   a  to take account of all the
important conditions   b  to allow weight to them severally in
proportion to their importance  and  c  not to include in our estimates
any condition which we cannot show to be probably present and operative 
thus the great man theory of history must surely be admitted to assign a
real condition of national success  the great man organises  directs 
inspires  is that nothing  on the other hand  to recognise no other
condition of national success is the manifest frenzy of a mind in the
mythop≈ìic age  we must allow the great man his due weight  and then
inquire into the general conditions that  a  bring him to birth in one
nation rather than another  and  b  give him his opportunity 

mill s explanation of the success of the aristocratic governments of
rome and venice is  that they were  in fact  bureaucracies  that is to
say  their members were trained in the science and art of
administration and command  here  again  we have  no doubt  a real
condition  but is it the only one  the popular mind  which little
relishes the scaling down of mill s original law to those two remote
cases  is persuaded that an aristocracy is the depository of hereditary
virtue  especially with reference to government  and would at once
ascribe to this circumstance the greater part of the success of any
aristocratic constitution  now  if the effects of training are
inherited  they must  in an hereditary aristocracy  increase the energy
of the cause assigned by mill  but  if not  such heredity is a condition
 not present or not operative   still  if families are ennobled for
their extraordinary natural powers of administration or command  as
sometimes happens   it is agreed on all hands that innate qualities are
inheritable  at least  if care be taken to intermarry with families
similarly distinguished  and if by natural or artificial selection all
the failures among the offspring be eliminated  the spartans had some
crude notion of both these precautions  and if such measures had been
widely adopted  we might deduce from the doctrine of heredity a
probability in favour of mill s original proposition  and thereby verify
it in its generality  if it could be collected from the facts 

the historical method may be further illustrated by the course adopted
in that branch of social science which has been found susceptible of the
most extensive independent development  namely  economics  first  by way
of contrast  i should say that the abstract  or theoretical treatment of
economics follows the physical method  because  as mill explains 
although the phenomena of industry are no doubt influenced  like other
social affairs  by all the other circumstances of society  government 
religion  war  art  etc   yet  where industry is most developed  as in
england and the united states  certain special conditions affecting it
are so much the most important that  for the purpose at least of a
first outline of the science  they may conveniently be considered as the
only ones  these conditions are   1  the general disposition of men to
obtain wealth with as little trouble as possible  and  2  to spend it so
as to obtain the greatest satisfaction of their various desires   3  the
facts that determine population  and  4  the tendency of extractive
industry  when pushed beyond a certain limit without any improvement in
the industrial arts  to yield  diminishing returns   from these premises
it is easy to infer the general laws of prices  of wages and interest
 which are the prices of labour and of the use of capital   and of rent 
and it remains to verify these laws by comparing them with the facts in
each case  and  if they fail to agree with the facts  to amend them 
according to the method of residues  by taking account of those
influential conditions which were omitted from the first draft of the
theory 

whilst  however  this is usually the procedure of those inquirers who
have done most to give economics its scientific character  to insist
that no other plan shall be adopted would be sheer pedantry  and dr 
keynes has shown  in his  scope and method of political economy   that
mill has himself sometimes solved economic problems by the historical
method  with an analysis of his treatment of peasant proprietorship
  political economy   b  ii   cc  7 and 8  we may close this section 
mill first shows inductively  by collecting evidence from switzerland 
germany  norway  belgium  and france  countries differing in race 
government  climate and situation   that peasant proprietors are
superhumanly industrious  intelligent cultivators  and generally
intelligent men  prudent  temperate  and independent  and that they
exercise self control in avoiding improvident marriages  this group of
empirical generalisations as to the character of peasant proprietors he
then deduces from the nature of the case  their industry  he says  is a
natural consequence of the fact that  however much they produce  it is
all their own  they cultivate intelligently  because for generations
they have given their whole mind to it  they are generally intelligent
men  because the variety of work involved in small farming  requiring
foresight and calculation  necessarily promotes intelligence  they are
prudent  because they have something to save  and by saving can improve
their station and perhaps buy more land  they are temperate  because
intemperance is incompatible with industry and prudence  they are
independent  because secure of the necessaries of life  and from having
property to fall back upon  and they avoid improvidence in marriage 
because the extent and fertility of their fields is always plainly
before them  and therefore how many children they can maintain is easily
calculated  the worst of them is that they work too hard and deny
themselves too much  but  over the greater part of the world  other
peasantry work too hard  though they can scarcely be said to deny
themselves too much  since all their labour for others brings them no
surplus to squander upon self indulgence 

  7  the foregoing account of the historical method is based upon mill s
discussions in b  vi  of his  logic   especially cc  6 to 11  mill
ascribes to comte the first clear statement of the method  and it is
highly scientific  and important in generalising the connections of
historical events  but perhaps the expression   historical method   is
more frequently applied to the comparative method  as used in
investigating the history of institutions or the true sense of legends 

 1  suppose we are trying to explain the institution of capital
punishment as it now exists in england   1  we must try to trace the
history of it back to the earliest times  for  social custom and
tradition is one line of causation   at present the punishment of death
is legally incident only to murder and high treason  but early in the
last century malefactors were hung for forgery  sheep stealing  arson
and a long list of other offences down to pocket picking  earlier still
the list included witchcraft and heresy  at present hanging is the only
mode of putting a malefactor to death  but formerly the ways of putting
to death included also burning  boiling  pressing  beheading  and mixed
modes  before the restoration  however  the offences punishable with
death were far fewer than they afterwards became  and until the twelfth
century  the penalty of death might be avoided by paying compensation 
the wer geld 

 2  every change in the history of an institution must be explained by
pointing to  the special causes  in operation during the time when the
change was in progress  thus the restriction of the death penalty  in
the nineteenth century  to so few offences was due partly to the growth
of humane feelings  partly to the belief that the infliction  or threat 
of the extreme penalty had failed to enforce the law and had demoralised
the administration of justice  the continual extension of the death
penalty throughout the eighteenth century may be attributed to a belief
that it was the most effectual means of deterring evil doers when the
means of detecting and apprehending criminals were feeble and
ill organised  the various old brutal ways of execution were adopted
sometimes to strike terror  sometimes for vengeance  sometimes from
horror of the crime  or even from  conscientious scruples    which last
were the excuse for preferring the burning of heretics to any sort of
bloodshed 

 3  the causes of any change in the history of an institution in any
country may not be directly discoverable  they must then be investigated
by the comparative method  again  the recorded history of a nation  and
of all its institutions  followed backwards  comes at last to an end 
then the antecedent history must also be supplied by the comparative
method  whose special use is to indicate the existence of facts for
which there is no direct evidence 

this method rests upon the principle that where the causes are alike the
effects will be alike  and that similar effects are traceable to similar
causes  every department of study  astronomy  chemistry  zoology 
sociology  is determined by the fact that the phenomena it investigates
have certain common characteristics  and we are apt to infer that any
process observed in some of these phenomena  if depending on those
common characteristics  will be found in others  for example  the
decomposition  or radio activity  of certain elements prepares one to
believe that all elements may exhibit it  where the properties of an
object are known to be closely interdependent  as in the organisation of
plants  animals and societies  we are especially justified in inferring
from one case to another  the whole animal kingdom has certain common
characters  the metabolic process  dependence upon oxygen  upon
vegetable food  ultimately   heredity  etc   and  upon this ground  any
process  say  the differentiation of species by natural selection  that
has been established for some kinds of animal is readily extended to
others  if instead of the whole animal kingdom we take some district of
it  class  order  family  our confidence in such inferences increases 
because the common characters are more numerous and the conditions of
life are more alike  or  in other words  the common causes are more
numerous that initiate and control the development of nearly allied
animals  for such reasons a few fragmentary remains of an extinct animal
enable the pal√¶ontologist to reconstruct with some probability an
outline of its appearance  organisation  food  habitat and habits 

applied to history  the comparative method rests upon an assumption
 which the known facts of  say  6 000 years amply justify  that human
nature  after attaining a recognisable type as  homo sapiens   is
approximately uniform in all countries and in all ages  though more
especially where states of culture are similar  men living in society
are actuated by similar motives and reasons in similar ways  they are
all dependent upon the supply of food and therefore on the sun and the
seasons and the weather and upon means of making fire  and so on 
accordingly  they entertain similar beliefs  and develop similar
institutions through similar series of changes  hence  if in one nation
some institution has been altered for reasons that we cannot directly
discover  whereas we know the reasons why a similar change was adopted
elsewhere  we may conjecture with more or less probability  after making
allowance for differences in other circumstances  that the motives or
causes in the former case were similar to those in the latter  or in any
cases that are better known  or  again  if in one nation we cannot trace
an institution beyond a certain point  but can show that elsewhere a
similar institution has had such or such an antecedent history  we may
venture to reconstruct with more or less probability the earlier history
of that institution in the nation we are studying 

amongst the english and saxon tribes that settled in britain  death was
the penalty for murder  and the criminal was delivered to the
next of kin of his victim for execution  he might  however  compound for
his crime by paying a certain compensation  studying the history of
other tribes in various parts of the world  we are able  with much
probability  to reconstruct the antecedents of this death penalty in our
own prehistoric ages  and to trace it to the blood feud  that is  to a
tribal condition in which the next of kin of a murdered man was socially
and religiously bound to avenge him by slaying the murderer or one of
his kindred  this duty of revenge is sometimes  and perhaps was at first
everywhere  regarded as necessary to appease the ghost of the victim 
sometimes as necessary to compensate the surviving members of his
family  in the latter case  it is open to them to accept compensation in
money or cattle  etc  whether the kin will be ready to accept
compensation must depend upon the value they set upon wealth in
comparison with revenge  but for the sake of order and tribal strength 
it is the interest of the tribe  or its elders  or chieftain  to
encourage or even to enforce such acceptance  it is also their interest
to take the questions  whether a crime has been committed  by whom  and
what compensation is due  out of the hands of the injured party  and to
submit them to some sort of court or judicial authority  at first 
following ancient custom as much as possible  the act of requital  or
the choice of accepting compensation  is left to the next of kin  but
with the growth of central power these things are entrusted to ministers
of the government  then revenge has undergone its full transformation
into punishment  very likely the wrong itself will come to be treated as
having been done not to the kindred of the murdered man  but to the
state or the king  as in fact a  breach of the king s peace   this
happened in our own history 

 4  the comparative method assumes that human nature is approximately
the same in different countries and ages  but  of course 
 approximately  is an important word  although there is often a striking
and significant resemblance between the beliefs and institutions of
widely separated peoples  we expect to draw the most instructive
parallels between those who are nearly related by descent  or
neighbourhood  or culture  to shed light upon our own manners  we turn
first to other teutons  then to slavonians and kelts  or other aryans 
and so on  and we prefer evidence from europe to examples from africa 

 5  as to national culture  that it exhibits certain  stages  of
development is popularly recognised in the distinction drawn between
savages  barbarians and civilised folk  but the idea remains rather
vague  and there is not space here to define it  i refer  therefore  to
the classifications of stages of culture given by a  sutherland 
  origin and growth of moral instinct   vol  i  p  103   and l t 
hobhouse   morals in evolution   c  2   that in any  state of society  
its factors  religion  government  science  etc   are mutually
dependent  was a leading doctrine with comte  adopted by mill  there
must be some truth in it  but in some cases we do not understand social
influences sufficiently well to trace the connection of factors  and
whilst preferring to look for historical parallels between nations of
similar culture  we find many cases in which barbarous or savage customs
linger in a civilised country 

 6  it was another favourite doctrine with comte  also adopted by
mill  that the general state of culture is chiefly determined by the
prevailing intellectual condition of a people  especially by the
accepted ground of explanation  whether the will of supernatural beings 
or occult powers  or physical antecedents  the  law of three stages  
fetichism  metaphysics  positivism  and this also is  at least  so far
true  that it is useless to try to interpret the manners and
institutions of any nation until we know its predominant beliefs  magic
and animism are beliefs everywhere held by mankind in early stages of
culture  and they influence every action of life  but that is not all 
these beliefs retain their hold upon great multitudes of civilised men
and affect the thoughts of the most enlightened  whilst the saying  that
human nature is the same in all ages  seems to make no allowance for the
fact that  in some nations  a considerable number of individuals has
attained to powers of deliberation  self control  and exact reasoning 
far above the barbarous level  it is yet so far true that  even in
civilised countries  masses of people  were it not for the example and
instruction of those individuals  would fall back upon magic and animism
and the manners that go with those beliefs  the different degrees of
enlightenment enjoyed by different classes of the population often
enable the less educated to preserve a barbarous custom amidst many
civilised characteristics of the national life 

  8  historical reasoning must start from  or be verified by 
observations  if we are writing the history of ourselves  if of another
time or country  we can observe some of the present conditions of the
country  its inhabitants  language  manners  institutions  which are
effects of the past and must be traceable to it  we may also be able to
observe ancient buildings or their ruins  funerary remains  coins 
dating from the very times we are to treat of  our own observations  of
course  are by no means free from error 

but even in treating of our own age and country  most of our information
must be derived from the testimony of others  who may have made mistakes
of observation and further mistakes in reporting their observations  or
may have intentionally falsified them  testimony is of two kinds  oral 
and written  inscribed or printed  in investigating the events of a
remote age  nearly all our direct evidence must be some sort of
testimony 

 1  oral testimony depends upon the character of the witness  and the
best witness is not perfectly trustworthy  for he may not have observed
accurately  or he may not have reported correctly  especially if some
time elapsed between the event and his account of it  for no man s
memory is perfect  since witnesses vary widely in capacity and
integrity  we must ask concerning any one of them  was he a good judge
of what he saw  and of what was really important in the event  had he
good opportunities of knowing the circumstances  had he any interest in
the event  personal  or partisan  or patriotic  such interests would
colour his report  and so would the love of telling a dramatic story  if
that was a weakness of his  nay  a love of truth might lead him to
modify the report of what he remembered if  as he remembered it  the
matter seemed not quite credible  we must also bear in mind that  for
want of training  precision in speaking the truth is not understood or
appreciated by many honest people even now  still less in unscientific
ages 

oral tradition is formed by passing a report from one to another 
generation by generation  and it is generally true that such a tradition
loses credit at every step  because every narrator has some weakness 
however  the value of tradition depends upon the motives people have to
report correctly  and on the form of the communication  and on whether
monuments survive in connection with the story  amongst the things best
remembered are religious and magic formul√¶  heroic poems  lists of
ancestors  popular legends about deeply impressive events  such as
migrations  conquests  famines  plagues  we are apt now to underrate the
value of tradition  because the use of writing has made tradition less
important  and therefore less pains are taken to preserve it  in the
middle of last century  it was usual  and then quite justifiable  to
depreciate oral tradition as nearly worthless  but the spread of
arch√¶ological and anthropological research  and the growth of the
comparative method  have given new significance to legends and
traditions which  merely by themselves  could not deserve the slightest
confidence 

 2  as to written evidence  contemporary inscriptions  such as are found
on rocks and stones and bricks in various parts of the world  and most
abundantly in egypt and western asia  are of the highest value  because
least liable to fraudulent abuse  but must be considered with reference
to the motives of those who set them forth  manuscripts and books give
rise to many difficulties  we have to consider whether they were
originally written by some one contemporary with the events recorded  if
so they have the same value as immediate oral testimony  provided they
have not been tampered with since  but if not contemporary records  they
may have been derived from other records that were contemporary  or only
from oral tradition  in the latter case they are vitiated by the
weakness of oral tradition  in the former case  we have to ask what was
the trustworthiness of the original records  and how far do the extant
writings fairly represent those records 

our answers to these questions will partly depend upon what we know or
can discover of the authors of the mss  or books  who was the author  if
a work bears some man s name  did he really write it  the evidence
bearing upon this question is usually divided into internal  external
and mixed  but perhaps no evidence is purely internal  if we define it
as that which is derived entirely from the work itself  under the name
of internal evidence it is usual to put the language  the style 
consistency of ideas  but if we had no grounds of judgment but the book
itself  we could not possibly say whether the style was the author s 
this requires us to know his other works  nor could we say whether the
language was that of his age  unless we knew other literature of the
same age  nor even that different passages seem to be written in the
manner of different ages  but for our knowledge of change in other
literatures  there must in every case be some external reference  thus
we judge that a work is not by the alleged author  nor contemporary with
him  if words are used that only became current at a later date  or are
used in a sense that they only later acquired  or if later writers are
imitated  or if events are mentioned that happened later
  anachronism    books are sometimes forged outright  that is  are
written by one man and deliberately fathered upon another  but sometimes
books come to be ascribed to a well known name  which were written by
some one else without fraudulent intent  dramatically or as a
rhetorical exercise 

as to external evidence  if from other sources we have some knowledge of
the facts described in a given book  and if it presents no serious
discrepancies with those facts  this is some confirmation of a claim to
contemporaneity  but the chief source of external evidence is other
literature  where we may find the book in question referred to or
quoted  such other literature may be by another author  as when
aristotle refers to a dialogue of plato s  or shakespeare quotes
marlowe  or may be other work of the author himself  as when aristotle
in the  ethics  refers to his own  physics   or chaucer in  the
canterbury tales  mentions as his own  the legend of good women   and in
 the legend  gives a list of other works of his  this kind of argument
assumes that the authorship of the work we start from is undisputed 
which is practically the case with the  ethics  and  the canterbury
tales  

but  now  granting that a work is by a good author  or contemporary with
the events recorded  or healthily related to others that were
contemporary  it remains to consider whether it has been well preserved
and is likely to retain its original sense  it is  therefore  desirable
to know the history of a book or ms   and through whose hands it has
passed  have there been opportunities of tampering with it  and have
there been motives to do so  in reprinting books  but still more in
copying mss   there are opportunities of omitting or interpolating
passages  or of otherwise altering the sense  in fact  slight changes
are almost sure to be made even without meaning to make them  especially
in copying mss   through the carelessness or ignorance of transcribers 
hence the oldest ms  is reckoned the best 

if a work contains stories that are physically impossible  it shows a
defect of judgment in the author  and decreases our confidence in his
other statements  but it does not follow that these others are to be
rejected  we must try to compare them with other evidence  even
incredible stories are significant  they show what people were capable
of believing  and  therefore  under what conditions they reasoned and
acted  one cause of the incredibility of popular stories is the fusion
of legend with myth  a legend is a traditionary story about something
that really happened  it may have been greatly distorted by stupidity 
or exaggeration  or dramatisation  or rationalisation  but may still
retain a good deal of the original fact  a myth  however  has not
necessarily any basis of fact  it may be a sort of primitive philosophy 
an hypothesis freely invented to explain some fact in nature  such as
eclipses  or to explain some social custom whose origin is forgotten 
such as the sacrificing of a ram 

all historical conclusions  then  depend on a sum of convergent and
conflicting probabilities in the nature of circumstantial evidence  the
best testimony is only highly probable  and it is always incomplete  to
complete the picture of any past age there is no resource but the
comparative method  we use this method without being aware of it 
whenever we make the records of the last generation intelligible to
ourselves by our own experience  without it nothing would be
intelligible  an ancient coin or weapon would have no meaning  were we
not acquainted with the origins and uses of other coins and weapons 
generally  the further we go back in history  the more the evidence
needs interpretation and reconstruction  and the more prominent becomes
the appeal to the comparative method  our aim is to construct a history
of the world  and of the planet as part of the world  and of mankind as
part of the life of the planet  in such a way that every event shall be
consistent with  and even required by  the rest according to the
principle of causation

hypotheses


  1  an hypothesis  sometimes employed instead of a known law  as a
premise in the deductive investigation of nature  is defined by mill as
 any supposition which we make  either without actual evidence  or on
evidence avowedly insufficient  in order to endeavour to deduce from it
conclusions in accordance with facts which are known to be real  under
the idea that if the conclusions to which the hypothesis leads are known
truths  the hypothesis itself either must be  or at least is likely to
be  true   the deduction of known truths from an hypothesis is its
verification  and when this has been accomplished in a good many cases 
and there are no manifest failures  the hypothesis is often called a
theory  though this term is also used for the whole system of laws of a
certain class of phenomena  as when astronomy is called the  theory of
the heavens   between hypothesis and theory in the former sense no
distinct line can be drawn  for the complete proof of any speculation
may take a long time  and meanwhile the gradually accumulating evidence
produces in different minds very different degrees of satisfaction  so
that the sanguine begin to talk of  the theory   whilst the circumspect
continue to call it  the hypothesis  

an hypothesis may be made concerning  1  an agent  such as the ether  or
 2  a collocation  such as the plan of our solar system  whether
geocentric or heliocentric  or  3  a law of an agent s operation  as
that light is transmitted by a wave motion of such lengths or of such
rates of vibration 

the received explanation of light involves both an agent  the ether  as
an all pervading elastic fluid  and also the law of its operation  as
transmitting light in waves of definite form and length  with definite
velocity  the agreement between the calculated results of this complex
hypothesis and the observed phenomena of light is the chief part of the
verification  which has now been so successfully accomplished that we
generally hear of the  undulatory theory   sometimes a new agent only is
proposed  as the planet neptune was at first assumed to exist in order
to account for perturbations in the movements of uranus  influencing it
according to the already established law of gravitation  sometimes the
agents are known  and only the law of their operation is hypothetical 
as was at first the case with the law of gravitation itself  for the
agents  namely  earth  falling bodies on the earth  moon  sun  and
planets were manifest  and the hypothesis was that their motions might
be due to their attracting one another with a force inversely
proportional to the squares of the distances between them  in the
ptolemaic astronomy  again  there was an hypothesis as to the
collocation of the heavenly bodies  namely  that our earth was the
centre of the universe  and that moon  sun  planets and stars revolved
around her   in the early form of the system there was also an
hypothesis concerning agents upon which this arrangement depended
 namely  the crystalline spheres in which the heavenly bodies were
fixed  though these were afterwards declared to be imaginary   and an
hypothesis concerning the law of operation  namely  that circular motion
is the most perfect and eternal  and therefore proper to celestial
things  

hypotheses are by no means confined to the physical sciences  we all
make them freely in private life  in searching for anything  we guess
where it may be before going to look for it  the search for the north
pole was likewise guided by hypotheses how best to get there  in
estimating the characters or explaining the conduct of acquaintances or
of public men  we frame hypotheses as to their dispositions and
principles   that we should not impute motives  is a peculiarly absurd
maxim  as there is no other way of understanding human life  to impute
bad motives  indeed  when good are just as probable  is to be wanting in
the scientific spirit  which views every subject in  a dry light   nor
can we help  judging others by ourselves   for self knowledge is the
only possible starting point when we set out to interpret the lives of
others  but to understand the manifold combinations of which the
elements of character are susceptible  and how these are determined by
the breeding of race or family under various conditions  and again by
the circumstances of each man s life  demands an extraordinary union of
sympathetic imagination with scientific habits of thought  such should
be the equipment of the historian  who pursues the same method of
hypothesis when he attempts to explain  say  the state of parties upon
the exclusion bill  or the policy of louis xi  problems such as the
former of these are the easier  because  amidst the compromises of a
party  personal peculiarities obliterate one another  and expose a
simpler scheme of human nature with fewer fig leaves  much more
hazardous hypotheses are necessary in interpreting the customs of
savages  and the feelings of all sorts of animals  literary criticisms 
again  abound with hypotheses  e g   as to the composition of the
homeric poems  the order of the platonic dialogues  the authorship of
the c√¶dmonic poems  or the ossianic  or of the letters of junius  thus
the method of our everyday thoughts is identical with that of our most
refined speculations  and in every case we have to find whether the
hypothesis accounts for the facts 

  2  it follows from the definition of an hypothesis that none is of
any use that does not admit of verification  proof or disproof   by
comparing the results that may be deduced from it with facts or laws  if
so framed as to elude every attempt to test it by facts  it can never be
proved by them nor add anything to our understanding of them 

suppose that a conjurer asserts that his table is controlled by the
spirit of your deceased relative  and makes it rap out an account of
some adventure that could not easily have been within a stranger s
knowledge  so far good  then  trying again  the table raps out some
blunder about your family which the deceased relative could not have
committed  but the conjurer explains that  a lying spirit  sometimes
possesses the table  this amendment of the hypothesis makes it equally
compatible with success and with failure  to pass from small things to
great  not dissimilar was the case of the ptolemaic astronomy  by
successive modifications  its hypothesis was made to correspond with
accumulating observations of the celestial motions so ingeniously that 
until the telescope was invented  it may be said to have been
unverifiable  consider  again  the sociological hypothesis  that civil
order was at first founded on a contract which remains binding upon all
mankind  this is reconcilable with the most opposite institutions  for
we have no record of such an event  and if the institutions of one state
 say the british  include ceremonies  such as the coronation oath and
oath of allegiance  which may be remnants of an original contract  they
may nevertheless be of comparatively recent origin  whereas if the
institutions of another state  say the russian  contain nothing that
admits of similar interpretation  yet traces of the contract once
existing may long since have been obliterated  moreover  the actual
contents of the contract not having been preserved  every adherent of
this hypothesis supplies them at his own discretion   according to the
dictates of reason   and so one derives from it the duty of passive
obedience  and another with equal cogency establishes the right of
rebellion 

to be verifiable  then  an hypothesis must be definite  if somewhat
vague in its first conception  which is reasonably to be expected   it
must be made definite in order to be put to the proof  but  except this
condition of verifiability  and definiteness for the sake of
verifiability  without which a proposition does not deserve the name of
an hypothesis  it seems inadvisable to lay down rules for a  legitimate 
hypothesis  the epithet is misleading  it suggests that the logician
makes rules for scientific inquirers  whereas his business is to
discover the principles which they  in fact  employ in what are
acknowledged to be their most successful investigations  if he did make
rules for them  and they treated him seriously  they might be
discouraged in the exercise of that liberty of hypothesising which is
the condition of all originality  whilst if they paid no attention to
him  he must suffer some loss of dignity  again  to say that a
 legitimate hypothesis  must explain all the facts  at least in the
department for which it is invented  is decidedly discouraging  no doubt
it may be expected to do this in the long run when  if ever  it is
completely established  but this may take a long time  is it meanwhile
illegitimate  or can this adjective be applied to newton s corpuscular
theory of light  even though it has failed to explain all the facts 

  3  given a verifiable hypothesis  however  what constitutes proof or
disproof 

 1   if a new agent be proposed  it is desirable that we should be able
directly to observe it  or at least to obtain some evidence of its
existence of a different kind from the very facts which it has been
invented to explain   thus  in the discovery of neptune  after the
existence of such a planet outside the orbit of uranus had been
conjectured  to account for the movements of the latter   the place in
the heavens which such a body should occupy at a certain time was
calculated  and there by means of the telescope it was actually seen 

agents  however  are assumed and reasoned upon very successfully which 
by their nature  never can be objects of perception  such are the atoms
of chemistry and the ether of optics  but the severer methodologists
regard them with suspicion  mill was never completely convinced about
the ether  the defining of which has been found very difficult  he was
willing  however  to make the most of the evidence that has been adduced
as indicating a certain property of it distinct from those by which it
transmits radiation  namely  mechanical inertia  whereby it has been
supposed to retard the career of the heavenly bodies  as shown
especially by the history of encke s comet  this comet returned sooner
than it should  as calculated from the usual data  the difference was
ascribed to the influence of a resisting medium in reducing the extent
of its orbit  and such a medium may be the ether  if this conjecture
 now of less credit  should gain acceptance  the ether might be regarded
as a  vera causa   that is  a condition whose existence may be proved
independently of the phenomena it was intended to explain   in spite of
its being excluded by its nature from the sphere of direct perception 
however  science is not a way of perceiving things  but essentially a
way of thinking about them  it starts  indeed  from perception and
returns to it  and its thinking is controlled by the analogies of
perception  atoms and ether are thought about as if they could be seen
or felt  not as noumena  and if still successful in connecting and
explaining perceptions  and free from contradiction  they will stand as
hypotheses on that ground 

on the other hand  a great many agents  once assumed in order to explain
phenomena  have since been explained away  of course  a  fact  can never
be  explained away   the phrase is properly applicable to the fate of
erroneous hypotheses  when  not only are they disproved  but others are
established in their places  of the aristotelian spheres  which were
supposed to support and translate sun  moon and planets  no trace has
ever been found  they would have been very much in the way of the
comets  phlogiston  again  an agent much in favour with the earlier
chemists  was found  whewell tells us  when their theories were tested
by exact weighing  to be not merely non existent but a minus quantity 
that is to say  it required the assumption of its absolute lightness  so
that it diminished the weight of the compounds into which it entered  
these agents  then  the spheres and phlogiston  have been explained
away  and instead of them we have the laws of motion and oxygen 

 2   whether the hypothetical agent be perceptible or not  it cannot be
established as a cause  nor can a supposed law of such an agent be
accepted as sufficient to the given inquiry  unless it is adequate to
account for the effects which it is called upon to explain  at least so
far as it pretends to explain them   the general truth of this is
sufficiently obvious  since to explain the facts is the purpose of an
hypothesis  and we have seen that newton gave up his hypothesis that the
moon was a falling body  as long as he was unable to show that the
amount of its deflection from a tangent  or fall  in a given time  was
exactly what it should be  if the moon was controlled by the same force
as falling bodies on the earth 

it is important to observe the limitations to this canon  in the first
place  it says that  unless adequate to explain the facts in question 
an hypothesis cannot be   established    but  for all that  such an
hypothesis may be a very promising one  not to be hastily rejected 
since it may take a very long time fully to verify an hypothesis  some
facts may not be obtainable that are necessary to show the connection of
others  as  for example  the hypothesis that all species of animals
have arisen from earlier ones by some process of gradual change  can be
only imperfectly verified by collecting the fossil remains of extinct
species  because immense depths and expanses of fossiliferous strata
have been destroyed  or  again  the general state of culture may be such
as to prevent men from tracing the consequences of an hypothesis  for
which reason  apparently  the doctrine that the sun is the centre of our
planetary system remained a discredited hypothesis for 2000 years  this
should instruct us not to regard an hypothesis as necessarily erroneous
or illegitimate merely because we cannot yet see how it works out  but
neither can we in such a case regard it as established  unless we take
somebody s word for it 

secondly  the canon says that an hypothesis is not established  unless
it accounts for the phenomena  so far as it professes to   but it
implies a complete misunderstanding to assail a doctrine for not
explaining what lies beyond its scope  thus  it is no objection to a
theory of the origin of species  that it does not explain the origin of
life  it does not profess to  for the same reason  it is no objection to
the theory of natural selection  that it does not account for the
variations which selection presupposes  but such objections might be
perfectly fair against a general doctrine of evolution 

an interesting case in wallace s  darwinism   chap  x   will illustrate
the importance of attending to the exact conditions of an hypothesis  he
says that in those groups of  birds that need protection from enemies  
 when the male is brightly coloured and the female sits exposed on the
nest  she is always less brilliant and generally of quite sober and
protective hues   and his hypothesis is  that these sober hues have been
acquired or preserved by natural selection  because it is important to
the family that the sitting bird should be inconspicuous  now to this it
might be objected that in some birds both sexes are brilliant or
conspicuous  but the answer is that the female of such species  does not
sit exposed on the nest   for the nests are either domed over  or made
in a hole  so that the sitting bird does not need protective colouring 
if it be objected  again  that some sober coloured birds build domed
nests  it may be replied that the proposition  all conspicuously
coloured birds are concealed in the nest   is not to be converted simply
into  all birds that sit concealed in the nest are conspicuously
coloured   in the cases alleged the domed nests are a protection against
the weather  and the sober colouring is a general protection to the
bird  which inhabits an open country  it may be urged  however  that
jays  crows  and magpies are conspicuous birds  and yet build open
nests  but these are aggressive birds   not needing protection from
enemies   finally  there are cases  it must be confessed  in which the
female is more brilliant than the male  and which yet have open nests 
yes  but  then the male sits upon the eggs   and the female is stronger
and more pugnacious 

thus every objection is shown to imply some inattention to the
conditions of the hypothesis  and in each case it may be said   exceptio
probat regulam   the exception  tests  the rule   of course  the usual
translation  proves the rule   in the restricted modern sense of
 prove   is absurd   that is to say  it appears on examination   1  that
the alleged exception is not really one  and  2  that it stands in such
relation to the rule as to confirm it  for to all the above objections
it is replied that  granting the phenomenon in question  special
protective colouring for the female  to be absent  the alleged cause
 need of protection  is also absent  so that the proof is  by means of
the objections  extended  from being one by the method of agreement 
into one by the double method 

thirdly  an hypothesis originally intended to account for the whole of a
phenomenon and failing to do so  though it cannot be established in that
sense  may nevertheless contain an essential part of the explanation 
the neptunian hypothesis in geology  was an attempt to explain the
formation of the earth s outer crust  as having been deposited from an
universal ocean of mud  in the progress of the science other causes 
seismic  fluvial and atmospheric  have been found necessary in order to
complete the theory of the history of the earth s crust  but it remains
true that the stratified rocks  and some that have lost their stratified
character  were originally deposited under water  inadequacy  therefore 
is not a reason for entirely rejecting an hypothesis or treating it as
illegitimate 

 3  granting that the hypothetical cause is real and adequate  the
investigation is not complete  agreement with the facts is a very
persuasive circumstance  the more so the more extensive the agreement 
especially if no exceptions are known  still  if this is all that can be
said in favour of an hypothesis  it amounts to proof at most by the
method of agreement  it does not exclude the possibility of vicarious
causes  and if the hypothesis proposes a new agent that cannot be
directly observed  an equally plausible hypothesis about another
imagined agent may perhaps be invented 

according to whewell  it is a strong mark of the truth of an hypothesis
when it agrees with distinct inductions concerning different classes of
facts  and he calls this the  consilience of inductions   because they
jump together in the unity of the hypothesis  it is particularly
convincing when this consilience takes place easily and naturally
without necessitating the mending and tinkering of the hypothesis  and
he cites the theory of gravitation and the undulatory theory of light as
the most conspicuous examples of such ever victorious hypotheses  thus 
gravitation explains the fall of bodies on the earth  and the orbits of
the planets and their satellites  it applies to the tides  the comets 
the double stars  and gives consistency to the nebular hypothesis 
whence flow important geological inferences  and all this without any
need of amendment  nevertheless  mill  with his rigorous sense of duty 
points out  that an induction is merely a proposition concerning many
facts  and that a consilience of inductions is merely a multiplication
of the facts explained  and that  therefore  if the proof is merely
agreement in each case  there can be no more in the totality  the
possibility of vicarious causes is not precluded  and the hypothesis
may  after all  describe an accidental circumstance 

whewell also laid great stress upon prediction as a mark of a true
hypothesis  thus  astronomers predict eclipses  occultations  transits 
long beforehand with the greatest precision  and the prediction of the
place of neptune by sheer force of deduction is one of the most
astonishing things in the history of science  yet mill persisted in
showing that a predicted fact is only another fact  and that it is
really not very extraordinary that an hypothesis  that happens to agree
with many known facts  should also agree with some still undiscovered 
certainly  there seems to be some illusion in the common belief in the
probative force of prediction  prediction surprises us  puts us off our
guard  and renders persuasion easy  in this it resembles the force of an
epigram in rhetoric  but cases can be produced in which erroneous
hypotheses have led to prediction  and whewell himself produces them 
thus  he says that the ptolemaic theory was confirmed by its predicting
eclipses and other celestial phenomena  and by leading to the
construction of tables in which the places of the heavenly bodies were
given at every moment of time  similarly  both newton s theory of light
and the chemical doctrine of phlogiston led to predictions which came
true 

what sound method demands in the proof of an hypothesis  then  is  not
merely that it be shown to agree with the facts  but that every other
hypothesis be excluded   this  to be sure  may be beyond our power 
there may in some cases be no such negative proof except the exhaustion
of human ingenuity in the course of time  the present theory of colour
has in its favour the failure of newton s corpuscular hypothesis and of
goethe s anti mathematical hypothesis  but the field of conjecture
remains open  on the other hand  newton s proof that the solar system is
controlled by a central force  was supported by the demonstration that a
force having any other direction could not have results agreeing with
kepler s second law of the planetary motions  namely  that  as a planet
moves in its orbit  the areas described by a line drawn from the sun to
the planet are proportional to the times occupied in the planet s
motion  when a planet is nearest to the sun  the area described by such
a line is least for any given distance traversed by the planet  and then
the planet moves fastest  when the planet is furthest from the sun  the
area described by such a line is greatest for an equal distance
traversed  and then the planet moves slowest  this law may be deduced
from the hypothesis of a central force  but not from any other  the
proof  therefore  as mill says  satisfies the method of difference 

apparently  to such completeness of demonstration certain conditions are
necessary  the possibilities must lie between alternatives  such as a or
not a  or amongst some definite list of cases that may be exhausted 
such as equal  greater or less  he whose hypothesis cannot be brought to
such a definite issue  must try to refute whatever other hypotheses are
offered  and naturally he will attack first the strongest rivals  with
this object in view he looks about for a  crucial instance   that is  an
observation or experiment that stands like a cross  sign post  at the
parting of the ways to guide us into the right way  or  in plain words 
an instance that can be explained by one hypothesis but not by another 
thus the phases of venus  similar to those of the moon  but concurring
with great changes of apparent size  presented  when discovered by
galileo  a crucial instance in favour of the copernican hypothesis  as
against the ptolemaic  so far at least as to prove that venus revolved
around the sun inside the orbit of the earth  foucault s experiment
determining the velocity of light  cited in the last chapter  was at
first intended as an  experimentum crucis  to decide between the
corpuscular and undulatory theories  and answered this purpose  by
showing that the velocity of a beam passed through water was less than
it should be by the former  but in agreement with the latter doctrine
 deschanel    813  

perhaps experiments of this decisive character are commonest in
chemistry  chemical tests  says herschel   are almost universally
crucial experiments   the following is abridged from playfair   encycl 
met   diss   iii    the chemists of the eighteenth century observed that
metals were rendered heavier by calcination  and there were two ways of
accounting for this  either something had been added in the process 
though what  they could not imagine  or  something had been driven off
that was in its nature light  namely  phlogiston  to decide between
these hypotheses  lavoisier hermetically sealed some tin in a glass
retort  and weighed the whole  he then heated it  and  when the tin was
calcined  weighed the whole again  and found it the same as before  no
substance  therefore  either light or heavy  had escaped  further  when
the retort was cooled and opened  the air rushed in  showing that some
of the air formerly within had disappeared or lost its elasticity  on
weighing the whole again  its weight was now found to have increased by
ten grains  so that ten grains of air had entered when it was opened 
the calcined tin was then weighed separately  and proved to be exactly
ten grains heavier than when it was placed in the retort  showing that
the ten grains of air that had disappeared had combined with the metal
during calcination  this experiment  then  decided against phlogiston 
and led to an analysis of common air confirming priestley s discovery of
oxygen 

 4   an hypothesis must agree with the rest of the laws of nature  and 
if not itself of the highest generality  must be derivable from primary
laws   chap  xix    1   gravitation and the diffusion of heat  light and
sound from a centre  all follow the  law of the inverse square   and
agree with the relation of the radius of a sphere to its surface  any
one who should think that he had discovered a new central force would
naturally begin to investigate it on the hypothesis that it conformed to
the same law as gravitation or light  a chemist again  who should
believe himself to have discovered a new element  would expect it to
fill one of the vacant places in the periodic table  conformity  in such
cases  is strong confirmation  and disagreement is an occasion of
misgivings 

a narrower hypothesis  as  that the toad s ugliness is protective  
would be supported by the general theory of protective colouring and
figure  and by the still more general theory of natural selection  if
facts could be adduced to show that the toad s appearance does really
deter its enemies  such an hypothesis resembles an empirical law in its
need of derivation  chap  xix     1  2   if underivable from  or
irreconcilable with  known laws  it is a mere conjecture or prejudice 
the absolute leviation of phlogiston  in contrast with the gravitation
of all other forms of matter  discredited that supposed agent  that
macpherson should have found the ossianic poems extant in the gaelic
memory  was contrary to the nature of oral tradition  except where
tradition is organised  as it was for ages among the brahmins  the
suggestion that xanthochroid aryans were  bleached  by exposure during
the glacial period  does not agree with wallace s doctrine concerning
the coloration of arctic animals  that our forefathers being predatory 
like bears  white variations amongst them were then selected by the
advantage of concealment  is a more plausible hypothesis 

although  then  the consilience of inductions or hypotheses is not a
sufficient proof of their truth  it is still a condition of it 
nonconsilience is a suspicious circumstance  and resilience  so to
speak   or mutual repugnance  is fatal to one or all 

  4  we have now seen that a scientific hypothesis  to deserve the name 
must be verifiable and therefore definite  and that to establish itself
as a true theory  it must present some symptom of reality  and be
adequate and exclusive and in harmony with the system of experience 
thus guarded  hypotheses seem harmless enough  but some people have a
strong prejudice against them  as against a tribe of savages without
government  or laws  or any decent regard for vested interests  it is
well known  too  that bacon and newton disparaged them  but bacon  in
his examples of an investigation according to his own method  is
obliged  after a preliminary classification of facts  to resort to an
hypothesis  calling it  permissio intellectus    interpretatio inchoata 
or  vindemiatio prima   and newton when he said  hypotheses non fingo  
meant that he did not deal in fictions  or lay stress upon supposed
forces  such as  attraction    that add nothing to the law of the facts 
hypotheses are essential aids to discovery  speaking generally 
deliberate investigation depends wholly upon the use of them 

it is true that we may sometimes observe a train of events that chances
to pass before us  when either we are idle or engaged with some other
inquiry  and so obtain a new glimpse of the course of nature  or we may
try experiments haphazard  and watch the results  but  even in these
cases  before our new notions can be considered knowledge  they must be
definitely framed in hypotheses and reobserved or experimented upon 
with whatever calculations or precautions may be necessary to ensure
accuracy or isolation  as a rule  when inquiring deliberately into the
cause of an event  whether in nature or in history  we first reflect
upon the circumstances of the case and compare it with similar ones
previously investigated  and so are guided by a preconception more or
less definite of  what to look for   what the cause is likely to be 
that is  by an hypothesis  then  if our preconception is justified  or
something which we observe leads to a new hypothesis  either we look for
other instances to satisfy the canons of agreement  or  if the matter
admits of experiment  we endeavour  under known conditions according to
the canon of difference  to reproduce the event by means of that which
our hypothesis assigns as the cause  or we draw remote inferences from
our hypothesis  and try to test these by the inductive canons 

if we argue from an hypothesis and express ourselves formally  it will
usually appear as the major premise  but this is not always the case  in
extending ascertained laws to fresh cases  the minor premise may be an
hypothesis  as in testing the chemical constitution of any doubtful
substance  such as a piece of ore  some solution or preparation  a  is
generally made which  it is known  will  on the introduction of a
certain agent  b  give a reaction  c  if the preparation contains a
given substance  x  the major premise is the law of reaction  

    whenever a is x  if treated with b it is c 

the minor premise is an hypothesis that the preparation contains x  an
experiment then treats a with b  if c result  a probability is raised in
favour of the hypothesis that a is x  or a certainty  if we know that c
results on that condition only 

so important are hypotheses to science  that whewell insists that they
have often been extremely valuable even though erroneous  of the
ptolemaic system he says   we can hardly imagine that astronomy could 
in its outset  have made so great a progress under any other form   it
served to connect men s thoughts on the subject and to sustain their
interest in working it out  by successive corrections  to save
appearances   it attained at last to a descriptive sort of truth  which
was of great practical utility  it also occasioned the invention of
technical terms  and  in general digested the whole body of observations
and prepared them for assimilation by a better hypothesis in the fulness
of time  whewell even defends the maxim that  nature abhors a vacuum  
as having formerly served to connect many facts that differ widely in
their first aspect   and in reality is it not true   he asks   that
nature  does  abhor a vacuum  and does all she can to avoid it   let no
forlorn cause despair of a champion  yet no one has accused whewell of
quixotry  and the sense of his position is that the human mind is a
rather feeble affair  that can hardly begin to think except with
blunders 

the progress of science may be plausibly attributed to a process of
natural selection  hypotheses are produced in abundance and variety  and
those unfit to bear verification are destroyed  until only the fittest
survive  wallace  a practical naturalist  if there ever was one  as well
as an eminent theorist  takes the same view as whewell of such
inadequate conjectures  of  lemuria   an hypothetical continent in the
indian ocean  once supposed to be traceable in the islands of
madagascar  seychelles  and mauritius  its surviving fragments  and
named from the lemurs  its characteristic denizens  he says   island
life   chap  xix   that it was  essentially a provisional hypothesis 
very useful in calling attention to a remarkable series of problems in
geographical distribution  of plants and animals   but not affording the
true solution of those problems   we see  then  that  provisional
hypotheses   or working hypotheses   though erroneous  may be very
useful or  as whewell says  necessary 

hence  to be prolific of hypotheses is the first attribute of scientific
genius  the first  because without it no progress whatever can be made 
and some men seem to have a marked felicity  a sort of instinctive
judgment even in their guesses  as if their heads were made according to
nature  but others among the greatest  like kepler  guess often and are
often wrong before they hit upon the truth  and themselves  like nature 
destroy many vain shoots and seedlings of science for one that they find
fit to live  if this is how the mind works in scientific inquiry  as it
certainly is  with most men  in poetry  in fine art  and in the scheming
of business   it is useless to complain  we should rather recognise a
place for fools  hypotheses  as darwin did for  fools  experiments   but
to complete the scientific character  there must be great patience 
accuracy  and impartiality in examining and testing these conjectures 
as well as great ingenuity in devising experiments to that end  the want
of these qualities leads to crude work and public failure and brings
hypotheses into derision  not partially and hastily to believe in one s
own guesses  nor petulantly or timidly to reject them  but to consider
the matter  to suspend judgment  is the moral lesson of science 
difficult  distasteful  and rarely mastered 

  5  the word  hypothesis  is often used also for the scientific device
of treating an abstraction as  for the purposes of argument  equivalent
to the concrete facts  thus  in geometry  a line is treated as having no
breadth  in mechanics  a bar may be supposed absolutely rigid  or a
machine to work without friction  in economics  man is sometimes
regarded as actuated solely by love of gain and dislike of exertion  the
results reached by such reasoning may be made applicable to the concrete
facts  if allowance be made for the omitted circumstances or properties 
in the several cases of lines  bars  and men  but otherwise all
conclusions from abstract terms are limited by their definitions 
abstract reasoning  then  that is  reasoning limited by definitions  
is often said to imply  the hypothesis  that things exist as their names
are defined  having no properties but those enumerated in their
definitions  this seems  however  a needless and confusing extension of
the term  for an hypothesis proposes an agent  collocation  or law
hitherto unknown  whereas abstract reasoning proposes to exclude from
consideration a good deal that is well known  there seems no reason why
the latter device should not be plainly called an abstraction 

such abstractions are necessary to science  for no object is
comprehensible by us in all its properties at once  but if we forget the
limitations of our abstract data  we are liable to make strange blunders
by mistaking the character of the results  treating the results as
simply true of actual things  instead of as true of actual things only
so far as they are represented by the abstractions  in addressing
abstract reasoning  therefore  to those who are unfamiliar with
scientific methods  pains should be taken to make it clear what the
abstractions are  what are the consequent limitations upon the argument
and its conclusions  and what corrections and allowances are necessary
in order to turn the conclusions into an adequate account of the
concrete facts  the greater the number  variety  and subtlety of the
properties possessed by any object  such as human nature   the greater
are the qualifications required in the conclusions of abstract
reasoning  before they can hold true of such an object in practical
affairs 

closely allied to this method of abstraction is the mathematical method
of limits  in his  history of scientific ideas   b  ii  c  12   whewell
says   the  idea of a limit  supplies a new mode of establishing
mathematical truths  thus with regard to the length of any portion of a
curve  a problem which we have just mentioned  a curve is not made up of
straight lines  and therefore we cannot by means of any of the
doctrines of elementary geometry measure the length of any curve  but we
may make up a figure nearly resembling any curve by putting together
many short straight lines  just as a polygonal building of very many
sides may nearly resemble a circular room  and in order to approach
nearer and nearer to a curve  we may make the sides more and more small 
more and more numerous  we may then possibly find some mode of
measurement  some relation of these small lines to other lines  which is
not disturbed by the multiplication of the sides  however far it be
carried  and thus we may do what is equivalent to measuring the curve
itself  for by multiplying the sides we may approach more and more
closely to the curve till no appreciable difference remains  the curve
line is the  limit  of the polygon  and in this process we proceed on
the  axiom  that  what is true up to the limit is true at the limit   

what whewell calls the axiom here  others might call an hypothesis  but
perhaps it is properly a postulate  and it is just the obverse of the
postulate implied in the method of abstractions  namely  that  what is
true of the abstraction is true of concrete cases the more nearly they
approach the abstraction   what is true of the  economic man  is truer
of a broker than of a farmer  of a farmer than of a labourer  of a
labourer than of the artist of romance  hence the abstraction may be
called a limit or limiting case  in the sense that it stands to concrete
individuals  as a curve does to the figures made up  by putting together
many short straight lines   correspondingly  the proper name may be
called the limit of the class name  since its attributes are infinite 
whereas any name whose attributes are less than infinite stands for a
possible class  in short  for logical purposes  a limit may be defined
as any extreme case to which actual examples may approach without ever
reaching it  and in this sense  method of limits  might be used as a
term including the method of abstractions  though it would be better to
speak of them generically as  methods of approximation  

we may also notice the assumptions  as they may be called  that are
sometimes employed to facilitate an investigation  because some definite
ground must be taken and nothing better can be thought of  as in
estimating national wealth  that furniture is half the value of the
houses 

it is easy to conceive of an objector urging that such devices as the
above are merely ways of avoiding the actual problems  and that they
display more cunning than skill  but science  like good sense  puts up
with the best that can be had  and  like prudence  does not reject the
half loaf  the position  that a conceivable case that can be dealt with
may  under certain conditions  be substituted for one that is
unworkable  is a touchstone of intelligence  to stand out for ideals
that are known to be impossible  is only an excuse for doing nothing at
all 

in another sense  again  the whole of science is sometimes said to be
hypothetical  because it takes for granted the uniformity of nature  for
this  in its various aspects  can only be directly ascertained by us as
far as our experience extends  whereas the whole value of the principle
of uniformity consists in its furnishing a formula for the extension of
our other beliefs beyond our actual experience  transcendentalists 
indeed  call it a form of reason  just because it is presupposed in all
knowledge  and they and the empiricists agree that to adduce material
evidence for it  in its full extent  is impossible  if  then  material
evidence is demanded by any one  he cannot regard the conclusions of
mathematics and physical science as depending on what is itself
unproved  he must  with mill  regard these conclusions as drawn  not
from but according to  the axioms of equality and causation  that is to
say  if the axioms are true  the conclusions are  the material evidence
for both the axioms and the conclusions being the same  namely 
uncontradicted experience  now when we say   if nature is uniform 
science is true   the hypothetical character of science appears in the
form of the statement  nevertheless  it seems undesirable to call our
confidence in nature s uniformity an  hypothesis   it is incongruous to
use the same term for our tentative conjectures and for our most
indispensable beliefs   the universal postulate  is a better term for
the principle which  in some form or other  every generalisation takes
for granted 

we are now sometimes told that  instead of the determinism and
continuity of phenomena hitherto assumed by science  we should recognise
indeterminism and discontinuity  but it will be time enough to fall in
with this doctrine when its advocates produce a new logic of induction 
and explain the use of the method of difference and of control
experiments according to the new postulates 




chapter xix

laws classified  explanation  co existence  analogy


  1  laws are classified  according to their degrees of generality  as
higher and lower  though the grades may not be decisively
distinguishable 

first  there are axioms or principles  that is real  universal 
self evident propositions  they are   1  real propositions  not  like
 the whole is greater than any of its parts   merely definitions  or
implied in definitions   2  they are regarded as universally true of
phenomena  as far as the form of their expression extends  that is  for
example  axioms concerning quantity are true of everything that is
considered in its quantitative aspect  though not  of course  in its
qualitative aspect   3  they are self evident  that is  each rests upon
its own evidence  whatever that may be   they cannot be derived from one
another  nor from any more general law  some  indeed  are more general
than others  the logical principle of contradiction   if a is b  it is
not not b   is true of qualities as well as of quantities  whereas the
axioms of mathematics apply only to quantities  the mathematical axioms 
again  apply to time  space  mental phenomena  and matter and energy 
whereas the law of causation is only true of concrete events in the
redistribution of matter and energy  such  at least  is the strict limit
of causation  if we identify it with the conservation of energy 
although our imperfect knowledge of life and mind often drives us to
speak of feelings  ideas  volitions  as causes  still  the law of
causation cannot be derived from the mathematical axioms  nor these from
the logical  the kind of evidence upon which axioms rest  or whether any
evidence can be given for them  is  as before observed  a question for
metaphysics  not for logic  axioms are the upward limit of logic  which 
like all the special sciences  necessarily takes them for granted  as
the starting point of all deduction and the goal of all generalisation 

next to axioms  come primary laws of nature  these are of less
generality than the axioms  and are subject to the conditions of
methodical proof  being universally true only of certain forces or
properties of matter  or of nature under certain conditions  so that
proof of them by logical or mathematical reasoning is expected  because
they depend upon the axioms for their formal evidence  such are the law
of gravitation  in astronomy  the law of definite proportions  in
chemistry  the law of heredity  in biology  and in psychology  the law
of relativity 

then  there are secondary laws  of still less generality  resulting from
a combination of conditions or forces in given circumstances  and
therefore conceivably derivable from the laws of those conditions or
forces  if we can discover them and compute their united effects 
accordingly  secondary laws are either   1  derivative  having been
analysed into  and deduced from  primary laws  or  2  empirical  those
that have not yet been deduced  though from their comparatively special
and complex character  it seems probable they may be  given sufficient
time and ingenuity   and that meanwhile rest upon some unsatisfactory
sort of induction by agreement or simple enumeration 

whether laws proved only by the canon of difference are to be considered
empirical  is perhaps a question  their proof derives them from the
principle of causation  but  being of narrow scope  some more special
account of them seems requisite in relation to the primary laws before
we can call them derivative in the technical sense 

many secondary laws  again  are partially or imperfectly derivative  we
can give general reasons for them  without being able to determine
theoretically the precise relations of the phenomena they describe 
meteorologists can explain the general conditions of all sorts of
weather  but have made little progress toward predicting the actual
course of it  at least  for our island   geologists know the general
causes of mountain ranges  but not why they rise just where we find
them  economists explain the general course of a commercial crisis  but
not why the great crises recurred at intervals of about ten years 

derivative laws make up the body of the exact sciences  having been
assimilated and organised  whilst empirical laws are the undigested
materials of science  the theorems of euclid are good examples of
derivative laws in mathematics  in astronomy  kepler s laws and the laws
of the tides  in physics  the laws of shadows  of perspective  of
harmony  in biology  the law of protective coloration  in economics  the
laws of prices  wages  interest  and rent 

empirical laws are such as bode s law of the planetary distances  the
laws of the expansion of different bodies by heat  and formul√¶
expressing the electrical conductivity of each substance as a function
of the temperature  strictly speaking  i suppose  all the laws of
chemical combination are empirical  the law of definite proportions is
verifiable in all cases that have been examined  except for variations
that may be ascribed to errors of experiment  much the same is true in
biology  most of the secondary laws are empirical  except so far as
structures or functions may be regarded as specialised cases in physics
or chemistry and deducible from these sciences  the theory of natural
selection  however  has been the means of rendering many laws  that were
once wholly empirical  at least partially derivative  namely  the laws
of the geographical distribution of plants and animals  and of their
adaptation in organisation  form and colour  habits and instincts  to
their various conditions of life  the laws that remain empirical in
biology are of all degrees of generality from that of the tendency to
variation in size and in every other character shown by every species
 though as to the reason of this there are promising hypotheses   down
to such curious cases as that the colour of roses and carnations never
varies into blue  that scarlet flowers are never sweet scented  that
bullfinches fed on hemp seed turn black  that the young of white  yellow
and dun pigeons are born almost naked  whilst others have plenty of
down   and so on  the derivation of empirical laws is the greater part
of the explanation of nature     5  6  

a  fact   in the common use of the word  is a particular observation  it
is the material of science in its rawest state  as perceived by a mind 
it is  of course  never absolutely particular  for we cannot perceive
anything without classing it  more or less definitely  with things
already known to us  nor describe it without using connotative terms
which imply a classification of the things denoted  still  we may
consider an observation as particular  in comparison with a law that
includes it with numerous others in one general proposition  to turn an
observation into an experiment  or  where experiment is impracticable 
to repeat it with all possible precautions and exactness  and to
describe it as to the duration  quantity  quality and order of
occurrence of its phenomena  is the first stage of scientific
manufacture  then comes the formulation of an empirical law  and lastly 
if possible  deduction or derivation  either from higher laws previously
ascertained  or from an hypothesis  however  as a word is used in
various senses  we often speak of laws as  facts   we say the law of
gravitation is a fact  meaning that it is real  or verifiable by
observations or experiments 

  2  secondary laws may also be classified according to their constancy
into   1  the invariable  as far as experience reaches   and  2 
approximate generalisations in the form  most x s are y  of the
invariable we have given examples above  the following are approximate
generalisations  most comets go round the sun from east to west  most
metals are solid at ordinary temperatures  most marsupials are
australasian  most arctic animals are white in winter  most cases of
plague are fatal  most men think first of their own interests  some of
these laws are empirical  as that  most metals are solid at ordinary
temperatures   at present no reason can be given for this  nor do we
know why most cases of plague are fatal  others  however  are at least
partially derivative  as that  most arctic animals are white   for this
seems to be due to the advantage of concealment in the snow  whether  as
with the bear  the better to surprise its prey  or  with the hare  to
escape the notice of its enemies 

but the scientific treatment of such a proposition requires that we
should also explain the exceptions  if  most are   this implies that
 some are not   why not  then  now  if we can give reasons for all the
exceptions  the approximate generalisation may be converted into an
universal one  thus   all arctic animals are white  unless  like the
raven  they need no concealment either to prey or to escape  or unless
mutual recognition is more important to them than concealment  as with
the musk sheep    the same end of universal statement may be gained by
including the conditions on which the phenomenon depends  thus   all
arctic animals to whom concealment is of the utmost utility are white  

when statistics are obtainable  it is proper to convert an approximate
generalisation into a proportional statement of the fact  thus  instead
of  most attacks of plague are fatal   we might find that in a certain
country 70 per cent  were so  then  if we found that in another country
the percentage of deaths was 60  in another 40  we might discover  in
the different conditions of these countries  a clue to the high rate of
mortality from this disease  even if the proportion of cases in which
two facts are connected does not amount to  most   yet  if any definite
percentage is obtainable  the proposition has a higher scientific value
than a vague  some   as if we know that 2 per cent  of the deaths in
england are due to suicide  this may be compared with the rates of
suicide in other countries  from which perhaps inferences may be drawn
as to the causes of suicide 

in one department of life  namely  politics  there is a special
advantage in true approximate generalisations amounting to  most cases  
the citizens of any state are so various in character  enlightenment 
and conditions of life  that we can expect to find few propositions
universally true of them  so that propositions true of the majority must
be trusted as the bases of legislation  if most men are deterred from
crime by fear of punishment  if most men will idle if they can obtain
support without industry  if most jurymen will refuse to convict of a
crime for which the prescribed penalties seem to them too severe  these
are most useful truths  though there should be numerous exceptions to
them all 

  3  secondary laws can only be trusted in  adjacent cases   that is 
where the circumstances are similar to those in which the laws are known
to be true 

a derivative law will be true wherever the forces concerned exist in the
combinations upon which the law depends  if there are no counteracting
conditions  that water can be pumped to about 33 feet at the sea level 
is a derivative law on this planet  is it true in mars  that depends on
whether there are in mars bodies of a liquid similar to our water 
whether there is an atmosphere there  and how great its pressure is 
which will vary with its height and density  if there is no atmosphere
there can be no pumping  or if there is an atmosphere of less pressure
than ours  water such as ours can only be pumped to a less height than
33 feet  again  we know that there are arctic regions in mars  if there
are also arctic animals  are they white  that may depend upon whether
there are any beasts of prey  if not  concealment seems to be of no use 

an empirical law  being one whose conditions we do not know  the extent
of its prevalence is still less ascertainable  where it has not been
actually observed to be true  we cannot trust it unless the
circumstances  on the whole  resemble so closely those amongst which it
has been observed  that the unknown causes  whatever they may be  are
likely to prevail there  and  even then  we cannot have much confidence
in it  for there may be unknown circumstances which entirely frustrate
the effect  the first naturalist who travelled  say  from singapore
eastward by sumatra and java  or borneo  and found the mammalia there
similar to those of asia  may naturally have expected the same thing in
celebes and papua  but  if so  he was entirely disappointed  for in
papua the mammalia are marsupials like those of australia  thus his
empirical law   the mammalia of the eastern archipelago are asiatic  
would have failed for no apparent reason  according to mr  wallace 
there is a reason for it  though such as could only be discovered by
extensive researches  namely  that the sea is deep between borneo and
celebes  so that they must have been separated for many ages  whereas it
is shallow from borneo westward to asia  and also southward from celebes
to australia  so that these regions  respectively  may have been
recently united  and the true law is that similar mammalia belong to
those tracts which at comparatively recent dates have formed parts of
the same continents  unless they are the remains of a former much wider
distribution  

a considerable lapse of time may make an empirical law no longer
trustworthy  for the forces from whose combination it resulted may have
ceased to operate  or to operate in the same combination  and since we
do not know what those forces were  even the knowledge that great
changes have taken place in the meantime cannot enable us  after an
interval  to judge whether or not the law still holds true  new stars
shine in the sky and go out  species of plants and animals become
extinct  diseases die out and fresh ones afflict mankind  all these
things doubtless have their causes  but if we do not know what they are 
we have no measure of the effects  and cannot tell when or where they
will happen 

laws of concomitant variations may hold good only within certain limits 
that bodies contract as the temperature falls  is not true of water
below 39¬∞ f  in psychology  weber s law is only true within the median
range of sensation intensities  not for very faint  nor for very strong 
stimuli  in such cases the failure of the laws may depend upon something
imperfectly understood in the collocation  as to water  on its molecular
constitution  as to sensation  upon the structure of the nervous system 

  4  secondary laws  again  are either of succession or of co existence 

those of succession are either   1  of direct causation  as that  water
quenches fire   or  more strictly  that  evaporation reduces
temperature   or  2  of the effect of a remote cause  as  bad harvests
tend to raise the price of bread   or  3  of the joint effects of the
same cause  as that  night follows day   from the revolution of the
earth   or the course of the seasons  from the inclination of the
earth s axis  

laws of co existence are of several classes   1  one has the generality
of a primary law  though it is proved only by agreement  namely   all
gravitating bodies are inert   others  though less general than this 
are of very extensive range  as that  all gases that are not decomposed
by rise of temperature have the same rate of expansion   and  in botany
that  all monocotyledonous plants are endogenous   these laws of
co existence are concerned with fundamental properties of bodies 

 2  next come laws of the co existence of those properties which are
comprised in the definitions of natural kinds  mill distinguished
between  Œ±  classes of things that agree among themselves and differ
from others only in one or a few attributes  such as  red things  
 musical notes    carnivorous animals    soldiers    and  Œ≤  classes of
things that agree among themselves and differ from others in a multitude
of characters  and the latter he calls natural kinds  these comprise the
chemical elements and their pure compounds  such as water  alcohol 
rock salt   and the species of plants and animals  clearly  each of
these is constituted by the co existence or co inherence of a multitude
of properties  some of which are selected as the basis of their
definitions  thus  gold is a metal of high specific gravity  atomic
weight 197 2  high melting point  low chemical affinities  great
ductility  yellow colour  etc   a horse has  a vertebral column 
mamm√¶  a placental embryo  four legs  a single well developed toe in
each foot provided with a hoof  a bushy tail  and callosities on the
inner sides of both the fore and the hind legs   huxley  

since darwinism has obtained general acceptance  some logicians have
doubted the propriety of calling the organic species  kinds   on the
ground that they are not  as to definiteness and permanence  on a par
with the chemical elements or such compounds as water and rock salt 
that they vary extensively  and that it is only by the loss of former
generations of animals that we are able to distinguish species at all 
but to this it may be replied that species are often approximately
constant for immense periods of time  and may be called permanent in
comparison with human generations  and that  although the leading
principles of logic are perhaps eternal truths  yet upon a detail such
as this  the science may condescend to recognise a distinction if it is
good for  say  only 100 000 years  that if former generations of plants
and animals were not lost  all distinctions of species would disappear 
may be true  but they are lost  for the most part beyond hope of
recovery  and accordingly the distinction of species is still
recognised  although there are cases  chiefly at the lower stages of
organisation  in which so many varieties occur as to make adjacent
species almost or quite indistinguishable  so far as species are
recognised  then  they present a complex co inherence of qualities 
which is  in one aspect  a logical problem  and  in another  a logical
datum  and  coming more naturally under the head of natural kinds than
any other  they must be mentioned in this place 

 3  there are  again  certain coincidences of qualities not essential to
any kind  and sometimes prevailing amongst many different kinds  such as
 insects of nauseous taste have vivid  warning  colours    white
tom cats with blue eyes are deaf    white spots and patches  when they
appear in domestic animals  are most frequent on the left side  

 4  finally  there may be constancy of relative position  as of sides
and angles in geometry  and also among concrete things  at least for
long periods of time   as of the planetary orbits  the apparent
positions of fixed stars in the sky  the distribution of land and water
on the globe  opposite seasons in opposite hemispheres 

all these cases of co existence  except the geometrical  present the
problem of deriving them from causation  for there is no general law of
co existence from which they can be derived  and  indeed  if we conceive
of the external world as a perpetual redistribution of matter and
energy  it follows that the whole state of nature at any instant  and
therefore every co existence included in it  is due to causation issuing
from some earlier distribution of matter and energy  hence  indeed  it
is not likely that the problems of co existence as a whole will ever be
solved  since the original distribution of matter is  of course 
unknown  still  starting with any given state of nature  we may hope to
explain some of the co existences in any subsequent state  we do not 
indeed  know why heavy bodies are always inert  nor why the chemical
elements are what they are  but it is known that  the properties of the
elements are functions of their atomic weight   which  though  at
present  only an empirical law  may be a clue to some deeper
explanation  as to plants and animals  we know the conditions of their
generation  and can trace a connection between most of their
characteristics and the conditions of their life  as that the teeth and
stomach of animals vary with their food  and that their colour generally
varies with their habitat 

geometrical co existence  when it is not a matter of definition  as  a
square is a rectangle with four equal sides    is deduced from the
definitions and axioms  as when it is shown that in triangles the
greater side is opposite the greater angle  the deductions of theorems
or secondary laws  in geometry is a type of what is desirable in the
physical sciences  the demonstration  namely  that all the connections
of phenomena  whether successive or co existent  are consequences of the
redistribution of matter and energy according to the principle of
causation 

coincidences of co existence  group  3   may sometimes be deduced and
sometimes not  that  nauseous insects have vivid coloration  comes under
the general law of  protective coloration   as they are easily
recognised and therefore avoided by insectivorous birds and other
animals  but why white tom cats with blue eyes should be deaf  is  i
believe  unknown  when co existences cannot be derived from causation 
they can only be proved by collecting examples and trusting vaguely to
the uniformity of nature  if no exceptions are found  we have an
empirical law of considerable probability within the range of our
exploration  if exceptions occur  we have at most an approximate
generalisation  as that  most metals are whitish   or  most domestic
cats are tabbies   but this probably is the ancestral colouring   we may
then resort to statistics for greater definiteness  and find that in
hampshire  say  90  per cent   of the domestic cats are tabby 

  5  scientific explanation consists in discovering  deducing  and
assimilating the laws of phenomena  it is the analysis of that
heracleitan  flux  which so many philosophers have regarded as
intractable to human inquiry  in the ordinary use of the word 
 explanation  means the satisfying a man s understanding  and what may
serve this purpose depends partly upon the natural soundness of his
understanding  and partly on his education  but it is always at last an
appeal to the primary functions of cognition  discrimination and
assimilation 

generally  what we are accustomed to seems to need no explanation 
unless our curiosity is particularly directed to it  that boys climb
trees and throw stones  and that men go fox hunting  may easily pass for
matters of course  if any one is so exacting as to ask the reason  there
is a ready answer in the  need of exercise   but this will not explain
the peculiar zest of those exercises  which is something quite different
from our feelings whilst swinging dumb bells or tramping the highway 
others  more sophisticated  tell us that the civilised individual
retains in his nature the instincts of his remote ancestors  and that
these assert themselves at stages of his growth corresponding with
ancestral periods of culture or savagery  so that if we delight to climb
trees  throw stones  and hunt  it is because our forefathers once lived
in trees  had no missiles but stones  and depended for a livelihood
upon killing something  to some of us  again  this seems an
explanation  to others it merely gives annoyance  as a superfluous
hypothesis  the fruit of a wanton imagination and too much leisure 

however  what we are not accustomed to immediately excites curiosity  if
it were exceptional to climb trees  throw stones  ride after foxes 
whoever did such things would be viewed with suspicion  an eclipse  a
shooting star  a solitary boulder on the heath  a strange animal  or a
chinaman in the street  calls for explanation  and among some nations 
eclipses have been explained by supposing a dragon to devour the sun or
moon  solitary boulders  as the missiles of a giant  and so on  such
explanations  plainly  are attempts to regard rare phenomena as similar
to others that are better known  a snake having been seen to swallow a
rabbit  a bigger one may swallow the sun  a giant is supposed to bear
much the same relation to a boulder as a boy does to half a brick  when
any very common thing seems to need no explanation  it is because the
several instances of its occurrence are a sufficient basis of
assimilation to satisfy most of us  still  if a reason for such a thing
be demanded  the commonest answer has the same implication  namely  that
assimilation or classification is a sufficient reason for it  thus  if
climbing trees is referred to the need of exercise  it is assimilated to
running  rowing  etc   if the customs of a savage tribe are referred
to the command of its gods  they are assimilated to those things that
are done at the command of chieftains 

explanation  then  is a kind of classification  it is the finding of
resemblance between the phenomenon in question and other phenomena  in
mathematics  the explanation of a theorem is the same as its proof  and
consists in showing that it repeats  under different conditions  the
definitions and axioms already assumed and the theorems already
demonstrated  in logic  the major premise of every syllogism is an
explanation of the conclusion  for the minor premise asserts that the
conclusion is an example of the major premise 

in concrete sciences  to discover the cause of a phenomenon  or to
derive an empirical law from laws of causation  is to explain it 
because a cause is an invariable antecedent  and therefore reminds us
of  or enables us to conceive  an indefinite number of cases similar to
the present one wherever the cause exists  it classifies the present
case with other instances of causation  or brings it under the universal
law  and  as we have seen that the discovery of the laws of nature is
essentially the discovery of causes  the discovery and derivation of
laws is scientific explanation 

the discovery of quantitative laws is especially satisfactory  because
it not only explains why an event happens at all  but why it happens
just in this direction  degree  or amount  and not only is the given
relation of cause and effect definitely assimilated to other causal
instances  but the effect is identified with the cause as the same
matter and energy redistributed  wherefore  whether the conservation of
matter and energy be universally true or not  it must still be an
universal postulate of scientific explanation 

the mere discovery of an empirical law of co existence  as that  white
tom cats with blue eyes are deaf   is indeed something better than an
isolated fact  every general proposition relieves the mind of a load of
facts  and  for many people  to be able to say   it is always so   may
be enough  but for scientific explanation we require to know the reason
of it  that is  the cause  still  if asked to explain an axiom  we can
only say   it is always so   though it is some relief to point out
particular instances of its realisation  or to exhibit the similarity of
its form to that of other axioms  as of the  dictum  to the axiom of
equality 

  6  there are three modes of scientific explanation  first  the
analysis of a phenomenon into the laws of its causes and the concurrence
of those causes 

the pumping of water implies  1  pressure of the air   2  distribution
of pressure in a liquid   3  that motion takes the direction of least
resistance  similarly  that thunder follows forked lightning  and that
the report of a gun follows the flash  are resolvable into  1  the
discharge of electricity  or the explosion of gunpowder   2  distance of
the observer from the event   3  that light travels faster than sound 
the planetary orbits are analysable into the tendency of planets to fall
into the sun  and their tendency to travel in a straight line  when this
conception is helped out by swinging a ball round by a string  and then
letting it go  to show what would happen to the earth if gravitation
ceased  we see how the recognition of resemblance lies at the bottom of
explanation 

secondly  the discovery of steps of causation between a cause and its
remote effects  the interpolation and concatenation of causes 

the maxim  no cats no clover  is explained by assigning the intermediate
steps in the following series  that the fructification of red clover
depends on the visits of humble bees  who distribute the pollen in
seeking honey  that if field mice are numerous they destroy the
humble bees  nests  and that  owls and weasels being exterminated by
gamekeepers  the destruction of field mice depends upon the supply of
cats  which  therefore  are a remote condition of the clover crop 
again  the communication of thought by speech is an example of something
so common that it seems to need no explanation  yet to explain it is a
long story  a thought in one man s mind is the remote cause of a similar
thought in another s  here we have  1  a thought associated with mental
words   2  a connection between these thoughts and some tracts of the
brain   3  a connection between these tracts of the brain and the
muscles of the larynx  the tongue and the lips   4  movements of the
chest  larynx and mouth  propelling and modifying waves of air   5  the
impinging of these air waves upon another man s ear  and by a complex
mechanism exciting the aural nerve   6  the transfer of this excitation
to certain tracts of his brain   7  a connection there with sounds of
words and their associated thoughts  if one of these links fail  there
is no communication 

thirdly  the subsumption of several laws under one more general
expression 

the tendency of bodies to fall to the earth and the tendency of the
earth itself  with the other planets  to fall into the sun  are subsumed
under the general law that  all matter gravitates   the same law
subsumes the movements of the tide  by means of the notion of specific
gravity  it includes  levitation   or the actual rising of some bodies 
as of corks in water  of balloons  or flames in the air  the fact being
that these things do not tend to rise  but to fall like everything else 
only as the water or air weighs more in proportion to its volume than
corks or balloons  the latter are pushed up 

this process of subsumption bears the same relation to secondary laws 
that these do to particular facts  the generalisation of many particular
facts  that is  a statement of that in which they agree  is a law  and
the generalisation of these laws  that is  again  a statement of that in
which they agree  is a higher law  and this process  upwards or
downwards  is characteristic of scientific progress  the perfecting of
any science consists in comprehending more and more of the facts within
its province  and in showing that they all exemplify a smaller and
smaller number of principles  which express their most profound
resemblances 

these three modes of explanation  analysis  interpolation  subsumption 
all consist in generalising or assimilating the phenomena  the pressure
of the air  of a liquid  and motion in the direction of least
resistance  are all commoner facts than pumping  that light travels
faster than sound is a commoner fact than a thunderstorm or gun firing 
each of the laws   cats kill mice    mice destroy humble bees  nests  
 humble bees fructify red clover   is wider and expresses the
resemblance of more numerous cases than the law that  clover depends on
cats   because each of them is less subject to further conditions 
similarly  every step in the communication of thought by language is
less conditional  and therefore more general  than the completion of the
process 

in all the above cases  again  each law into which the phenomenon
 whether pumping or conversation  is resolved  suggests a host of
parallel cases  as the modifying of air waves by the larynx and lips
suggests the various devices by which the strings and orifices of
musical instruments modify the character of notes 

subsumption consists entirely in proving the existence of an essential
similarity between things where it was formerly not observed  as that
the gyrations of the moon  the fall of apples  and the flotation of
bubbles are all examples of gravitation  or that the purifying of the
blood by breathing  the burning of a candle  and the rusting of iron are
all cases of oxidation  or that the colouring of the underside of a
red admiral s wings  the spots of the giraffe  the shape and attitude of
a stick caterpillar  the immobility of a bird on its nest  and countless
other cases  though superficially so different  agree in this  that they
conceal and thereby protect the organism 

not any sort of likeness  however  suffices for scientific explanation 
the only satisfactory explanation of concrete things or events  is to
discover their likeness to others in respect of causation  hence
attempts to help the understanding by familiar comparisons are often
worse than useless  any of the above examples will show that the first
result of explanation is not to make a phenomenon seem familiar  but to
put  as the saying is   quite a new face upon it   when  indeed  we have
thought it over in all its newly discovered relations  we feel more at
home with it than ever  and this is one source of our satisfaction in
explaining things  and hence to substitute immediate familiarisation for
radical explanation  is the easily besetting sin of human understanding 
the most plausible of fallacies  the most attractive  the most difficult
to avoid even when we are on our guard against it 

  7  the explanation of nature  if it be admitted to consist in
generalisation  or the discovery of resemblance amidst differences  can
never be completed  for   1  there are  as mill says  facts  namely 
fundamental states or processes of consciousness  which are distinct  in
other words  they do not resemble one another  and therefore cannot be
generalised or subsumed under one explanation  colour  heat  smell 
sound  touch  pleasure and pain  are so different that there is one
group of conditions to be sought for each  and the laws of these
conditions cannot be subsumed under a more general one without leaving
out the very facts to be explained  a general condition of sensation 
such as the stimulating of the sensory organs of a living animal  gives
no account of the  special  characters of colour  smell  etc   which
are  however  the phenomena in question  and each of them has its own
law  nay  each distinct sensation quality  or degree  must have its own
law  for in each ultimate difference there is something that cannot be
assimilated  such differences amount  according to experimental
psychologists  to more than 50 000  moreover  a neural process can never
explain a conscious process in the way of cause and effect  for there is
no equivalence between them  and one can never absorb the other 

 2  when physical science is treated objectively  that is  with as
little reference as possible to the fact that all phenomena are only
known in relation to the human mind   colour  heat  smell  sound
 considered as sensations  are neglected  and attention is fixed upon
certain of their conditions  extension  figure  resistance  weight 
motion  with their derivatives  density  elasticity  etc  these are
called the primary qualities of matter  and it is assumed that they
belong to matter by itself  whether we look on or not  whilst colour 
heat  sound  etc   are called secondary qualities  as depending
entirely upon the reaction of some conscious animal  by physical science
the world is considered in the abstract  as a perpetual redistribution
of matter and energy  and the distracting multiplicity of sensations
seems to be got rid of 

but  not to dwell upon the difficulty of reducing the activities of life
and chemistry to mechanical principles  even if this were done  complete
explanation could not be attained  for   a  as explanation is the
discovery of causes  we no sooner succeed in assigning the causes of the
present state of the world than we have to inquire into the causes of
those causes  and again the still earlier causes  and so on to infinity 
but  this being impossible  we must be content  wherever we stop  to
contemplate the uncaused  that is  the unexplained  and then all that
follows is only relatively explained 

besides this difficulty  however  there is another that prevents the
perfecting of any theory of the abstract material world  namely  b  
that it involves more than one first principle  for we have seen that
the uniformity of nature is not really a principle  but a merely nominal
generalisation  since it cannot be definitely stated  and  therefore 
the principles of contradiction  mediate equality  and causation remain
incapable of subsumption  nor can any one of them be reduced to another 
so that they remain unexplained 

 3  another limit to explanation lies in the infinite character of every
particular fact  so that we may know the laws of many of its properties
and yet come far short of understanding it as a whole  a lump of
sandstone in the road  we may know a good deal about its specific
gravity  temperature  chemical composition  geological conditions  but
if we inquire the causes of the particular modifications it exhibits of
these properties  and further why it is just so big  containing so many
molecules  neither more nor less  disposed in just such relations to one
another as to give it this particular figure  why it lies exactly there
rather than a yard off  and so forth  we shall get no explanation of all
this  the causes determining each particular phenomenon are infinite 
and can never be computed  and  therefore  it can never be fully
explained 

  8  analogy is used in two senses   1  for the resemblance of relations
between terms that have little or no resemblance  as  the wind drives
the clouds as a shepherd drives his sheep   where wind and shepherd 
clouds and sheep are totally unlike  such analogies are a favourite
figure in poetry and rhetoric  but cannot prove anything  for valid
reasoning there must be parallel cases  according to substance and
attribute  or cause and effect  or proportion  e g   as cattle and deer
are to herbivorousness  so are camels  as bodies near the earth fall
toward it  so does the moon  as 2 is to 3 so is 4 to 6  

 2  analogy is discussed in logic as a kind of probable proof based upon
imperfect similarity  as the best that can be discovered  between the
 data  of comparison and the subject of our inference  like deduction
and induction  it assumes that things which are alike in some respects
are also alike in others  but it differs from them in not appealing to a
definite general law assigning the essential points of resemblance upon
which the argument relies  in deductive proof  this is done by the major
premise of every syllogism  if the major says that  all fat men are
humorists   and we can establish the minor   x is a fat man   we have
secured the essential resemblance that carries the conclusion  in
induction  the law of causation and its representatives  the canons 
serve the same purpose  specifying the essential marks of a cause  but 
in analogy  the resemblance relied on cannot be stated categorically 

if we argue that mars is inhabited because it resembles the datum  our
earth   1  in being a planet   2  neither too hot nor too cold for life 
 3  having an atmosphere   4  land and water  etc   we are not
prepared to say that  all planets having these characteristics are
inhabited   it is  therefore  not a deduction  and since we do not know
the original causes of life on the earth  we certainly cannot show by
induction that adequate causes exist in mars  we rely  then  upon some
such vague notion of uniformity as that  things alike in some points are
alike in others   which  plainly  is either false or nugatory  but if
the linear markings upon the surface of mars indicate a system of
canals  the inference that he has intelligent inhabitants is no longer
analogical  since canals can have no other cause 

the cogency of any proof depends upon the  character  and  definiteness 
of the likeness which one phenomenon bears to another  but analogy
trusts to the general  quantity  of likeness between them  in ignorance
of what may be the really important likeness  if  having tried with a
stone  an apple  a bullet  etc   we find that they all break an
ordinary window  and thence infer that a cricket ball will do so  we do
not reason by analogy  but make instinctively a deductive extension of
an induction  merely omitting the explicit generalisation   all missiles
of a certain weight  size and solidity break windows   but if  knowing
nothing of snakes except that the viper is venomous  a child runs away
from a grass snake  he argues by analogy  and  though his conduct is
prudentially justifiable  his inference is wrong  for there is no law
that  all snakes are venomous   but only that those are venomous that
have a certain structure of fang  a point which he did not stay to
examine 

the discovery of an analogy  then  may suggest hypotheses  it states a
problem  to find the causes of the analogy  and thus it may lead to
scientific proof  but merely analogical argument is only probable in
various degrees   1  the greater the number and importance of the points
of agreement  the more probable is the inference   2  the greater the
number and importance of the points of difference  the less probable is
the inference   3  the greater the number of unknown properties in the
subject of our argument  the less the value of any inference from those
that we do know  of course the number of unknown properties can itself
be estimated only by analogy  in the case of mars  they are probably
very numerous  and  apart from the evidence of canals  the prevalent
assumption that there are intelligent beings in that planet  seems to
rest less upon probability than on a curiously imaginative extension of
the gregarious sentiment  the chilly discomfort of mankind at the
thought of being alone in the universe  and a hope that there may be
conversable and  clubable  souls nearer than the dog star 




chapter xx

probability


  1  chance was once believed to be a distinct power in the world 
disturbing the regularity of nature  though  according to aristotle  it
was only operative in occurrences below the sphere of the moon  as 
however  it is now admitted that every event in the world is due to some
cause  if we can only trace the connection  whilst nevertheless the
notion of chance is still useful when rightly conceived  we have to find
some other ground for it than that of a spontaneous capricious force
inherent in things  for such a conception can have no place in any
logical interpretation of nature  it can never be inferred from a
principle  seeing that every principle expresses an uniformity  nor 
again  if the existence of a capricious power be granted  can any
inference be drawn from it  impossible alike as premise and as
conclusion  for reason it is nothing at all 

every event is a result of causes  but the multitude of forces and the
variety of collocations being immeasurably great  the overwhelming
majority of events occurring about the same time are only related by
causation so remotely that the connection cannot be followed  whilst my
pen moves along the paper  a cab rattles down the street  bells in the
neighbouring steeple chime the quarter  a girl in the next house is
practising her scales  and throughout the world innumerable events are
happening which may never happen together again  so that should one of
them recur  we have no reason to expect any of the others  this is
chance  or chance coincidence  the word coincidence is vulgarly used
only for the inexplicable concurrence of  interesting  events   quite a
coincidence  

on the other hand  many things are now happening together or coinciding 
that will do so  for assignable reasons  again and again  thousands of
men are leaving the city  who leave at the same hour five days a week 
but this is not chance  it is causal coincidence due to the custom of
business in this country  as determined by our latitude and longitude
and other circumstances  no doubt the above chance
coincidences  writing  cab rattling  chimes  scales  etc   are
causally connected at some point of past time  they were predetermined
by the condition of the world ten minutes ago  and that was due to
earlier conditions  one behind the other  even to the formation of the
planet  but whatever connection there may have been  we have no such
knowledge of it as to be able to deduce the coincidence  or calculate
its recurrence  hence chance is defined by mill to be  coincidence
giving no ground to infer uniformity 

still  some chance coincidences do recur according to laws of their own 
i say  some   but it may be all  if the world is finite  the possible
combinations of its elements are exhaustible  and  in time  whatever
conditions of the world have concurred will concur again  and in the
same relation to former conditions  this writing  that cab  those
chimes  those scales will coincide again  the argonautic expedition  and
the trojan war  and all our other troubles will be renewed  but let us
consider some more manageable instance  such as the throwing of dice 
every one who has played much with dice knows that double sixes are
sometimes thrown  and sometimes double aces  such coincidences do not
happen once and only once  they occur again and again  and a great
number of trials will show that  though their recurrence has not the
regularity of cause and effect  it yet has a law of its own  namely  a
tendency to average regularity  in 10 000 throws there will be some
number of double sixes  and the greater the number of throws the more
closely will the average recurrence of double sixes  or double aces 
approximate to one in thirty six  such a law of average recurrence is
the basis of probability  chance being the fact of coincidence without
assignable cause  probability is expectation based on the average
frequency of its happening 

  2  probability is an ambiguous term  usually  when we say that an
event is  probable   we mean that it is more likely than not to happen 
but  scientifically  an event is probable if our expectation of its
occurrence is less than certainty  as long as the event is not
impossible  probability  thus conceived  is represented by a fraction 
taking 1 to stand for certainty  and 0 for impossibility  probability
may be 999/1000  or 1/1000  or  generally  1/ m   the denominator
represents the number of times that an event happens  and the numerator
the number of times that it coincides with another event  in throwing a
die  the probability of ace turning up is expressed by putting the
number of throws for the denominator and the number of times that ace is
thrown for the numerator  and we may assume that the more trials we make
the nearer will the resulting fraction approximate to 1/6 

instead of speaking of the  throwing of the die  and its  turning up
ace  as two events  the former is called  the event  and the latter  the
way of its happening   and these expressions may easily be extended to
cover relations of distinct events  as when two men shoot at a mark and
we desire to represent the probability of both hitting the bull s eye
together  each shot may count as an event  denominator  and the
coincidence of  bull s eyes  as the way of its happening  numerator  

it is also common to speak of probability as a proportion  if the
fraction expressing the probability of ace being cast is 1/6  the
proportion of cases in which it happens is 1 to 5  or  as it is 
perhaps  still more commonly put   the chances are 5 to 1 against it  

  3  as to the grounds of probability opinions differ  according to one
view the ground is subjective  probability depends  it is said  upon the
quantity of our belief in the happening of a certain event  or in its
happening in a particular way  according to the other view the ground is
objective  and  in fact  is nothing else than experience  which is most
trustworthy when carefully expressed in statistics 

to the subjective view it may be objected   a  that belief cannot by
itself be satisfactorily measured  no one will maintain that belief 
merely as a state of mind  always has a definite numerical value of
which one is conscious  as 1/100 or 1/10  let anybody mix a number of
letters in a bag  knowing nothing of them except that one of them is x 
and then draw them one by one  endeavouring each time to estimate the
value of his belief that the next will be x  can he say that his belief
in the drawing of x next time regularly increases as the number of
letters left decreases 

if not  we see that  b  belief does not uniformly correspond with the
state of the facts  if in such a trial as proposed above  we really wish
to draw x  as when looking for something in a number of boxes  how
common it is  after a few failures  to feel quite hopeless and to say 
 oh  of course it will be in the last   for belief is subject to hope
and fear  temperament  passion  and prejudice  and not merely to
rational considerations  and it is useless to appeal to  the wise man  
the purely rational judge of probability  unless he is producible  or 
if it be said that belief is a short cut to the evaluation of
experience  because it is the resultant of all past experience  we may
reply that this is not true  for one striking experience  or two or
three recent ones  will immensely outweigh a great number of faint or
remote experiences  moreover  the experience of two men may be
practically equal  whilst their beliefs upon any question greatly
differ  any two englishmen have about the same experience  personal and
ancestral  of the weather  yet their beliefs in the saw that  if it rain
on st  swithin s day it will rain for forty days after   may differ as
confident expectation and sheer scepticism  upon which of these beliefs
shall we ground the probability of forty days  rain 

but  c  at any rate  if probability is to be connected with inductive
logic  it must rest upon the same ground  namely  observation 
induction  in any particular case  is not content with beliefs or
opinions  but aims at testing  verifying or correcting them by appealing
to the facts  and probability has the same object and the same basis 

in some cases  indeed  the conditions of an event are supposed to be
mathematically predetermined  as in tossing a penny  throwing dice 
dealing cards  in throwing a die  the ways of happening are six  in
tossing a penny only two  head and tail  and we usually assume that the
odds with a die are fairly 5 to 1 against ace  whilst with a penny  the
betting is even  on head or tail  still  this assumption rests upon
another  that the die is perfectly fair  or that the head and tail of a
penny are exactly alike  and this is not true  with an ordinary die or
penny  a very great number of trials would  no doubt  give an average
approximating to 1/6 or 1/2  yet might always leave a certain excess one
way or the other  which would also become more definite as the trials
went on  thus showing that the die or penny did not satisfy the
mathematical hypothesis  buffon is said to have tossed a coin 4040
times  obtaining 1992 heads and 2048 tails  a pupil of de morgan tossed
4092 times  obtaining 2048 heads and 2044 tails 

there are other important cases in which probability is estimated and
numerically expressed  although statistical evidence directly bearing
upon the point in question cannot be obtained  as in betting upon a
race  or in the prices of stocks and shares  which are supposed to
represent the probability of their paying  or continuing to pay  a
certain rate of interest  but the judgment of experts in such matters is
certainly based upon experience  and great pains are taken to make the
evidence as definite as possible by comparing records of speed  or by
financial estimates  though something must still be allowed for reports
of the condition of horses  or of the prospects of war  harvests  etc 

however  where statistical evidence is obtainable  no one dreams of
estimating probability by the quantity of his belief  insurance offices 
dealing with fire  shipwreck  death  accident  etc   prepare elaborate
statistics of these events  and regulate their rates accordingly  apart
from statistics  at what rate ought the lives of men aged 40 to be
insured  in order to leave a profit of 5 per cent  upon ¬£1000 payable at
each man s death  is  quantity of belief  a sufficient basis for doing
this sum 

  4  the ground of probability is experience  then  and  whenever
possible  statistics  which are a kind of induction  it has indeed been
urged that induction is itself based upon probability  that the
subtlety  complexity and secrecy of nature are such  that we are never
quite sure that we fully know even what we have observed  and that  as
for laws  the conditions of the universe at large may at any moment be
completely changed  so that all imperfect inductions  including the law
of causation itself  are only probable  but  clearly  this doctrine
turns upon another ambiguity in the word  probable   it may be used in
the sense of  less than absolutely certain   and such doubtless is the
condition of all human knowledge  in comparison with the comprehensive
intuition of arch angels  or it may mean  less than certain according
to  our  standard of certainty   that is  in comparison with the law of
causation and its derivatives 

we may suppose some one to object that  by this relative standard even
empirical laws cannot be called  only probable  as long as we  know no
exception to them   for that is all that can be said for the boasted law
of causation  and that  accordingly  we can frame no fraction to
represent their probability  that  all swans are white  was at one time 
from this point of view  not probable but certain  though we now know it
to be false  it would have been an indecorum to call it only probable as
long as no other coloured swan had been discovered  not merely because
the quantity of belief amounted to certainty  but because the number of
events  seeing a swan  and the number of their happenings in a certain
way  being white  were equal  and therefore the evidence amounted to 1
or certainty   but  in fact  such an empirical law is only probable  and
the estimate of its probability must be based on the number of times
that similar laws have been found liable to exceptions  albinism is of
frequent occurrence  and it is common to find closely allied varieties
of animals differing in colour  had the evidence been duly weighed  it
could never have seemed more than probable that  all swans are white  
but what law  approaching the comprehensiveness of the law of causation 
presents any exceptions 

supposing evidence to be ultimately nothing but accumulated experience 
the amount of it in favour of causation is incomparably greater than the
most that has ever been advanced to show the probability of any other
kind of event  and every relation of events which is shown to have the
marks of causation obtains the support of that incomparably greater body
of evidence  hence the only way in which causation can be called
probable  for us  is by considering it as the upward limit  1  to which
the series of probabilities tends  as impossibility is the downward
limit  0   induction   humanly speaking   does not rest on probability 
but the probability of concrete events  not of mere mathematical
abstractions like the falling of absolutely true dice  rests on
induction and  therefore  on causation  the inductive evidence
underlying an estimate of probability may be of three kinds   a  direct
statistics of the events in question  as when we find that  at the age
of 20  the average expectation of life is 39 40 years  this is an
empirical law  and  if we do not know the causes of any event  we must
be content with an empirical law  but  b  if we do know the causes of an
event  and the causes which may prevent its happening  and can estimate
the comparative frequency of their occurring  we may deduce the
probability that the effect  that is  the event in question  will occur 
or  c  we may combine these two methods  verifying each by means of the
other  now either the method  b  or   a fortiori   the method  c   both
depending on causation  is more trustworthy than the method  a  by
itself 

but  further  a merely empirical statistical law will only be true as
long as the causes influencing the event remain the same  a die may be
found to turn ace once in six throws  on the average  in close
accordance with mathematical theory  but if we load it on that facet the
results will be very different  so it is with the expectation of life 
or fire  or shipwreck  the increased virulence of some epidemic such as
influenza  an outbreak of anarchic incendiarism  a moral epidemic of
over loading ships  may deceive the hopes of insurance offices  hence we
see  again  that probability depends upon causation  not causation upon
probability 

that uncertainty of an event which arises not from ignorance of the law
of its cause  but from our not knowing whether the cause itself does or
does not occur at any particular time  is contingency 

  5  the nature of an average supposes deviations from it  deviations
from an average  or  errors   are assumed to conform to the law  1  that
the greater errors are less frequent than the smaller  so that most
events approximate to the average  and  2  that errors have no  bias  
but are equally frequent and equally great in both directions from the
mean  so that they are scattered symmetrically  hence their distribution
may be expressed by some such figure as the following 

 illustration  fig  11  

here  o  is the average event  and  oy  represents the number of average
events  along  ox   in either direction  deviations are measured  at  p 
the amount of error or deviation is  op   and the number of such
deviations is represented by the line or ordinate  pa   at  s  the
deviation is  os   and the number of such deviations is expressed by
 sb   as the deviations grow greater  the number of them grows less  on
the other side of  o   toward   x   at distances   op     os    equal to
 op    os   the lines  p a     s b   represent the numbers of those
errors  equal to  pa    sb   

if  o  is the average height of the adult men of a nation   say  5 ft  6
in    s   and  s  may stand for 5 ft  and 6 ft   men of 4 ft  6 in  lie
further toward   x   and men of 6 ft  6 in  further toward  x   there
are limits to the stature of human beings  or to any kind of animal or
plant  in both directions  because of the physical conditions of
generation and birth  with such events the curve  b yb  meets the
abscissa at some point in each direction  though where this occurs can
only be known by continually measuring dwarfs and giants  but in
throwing dice or tossing coins  whilst the average occurrence of ace is
once in six throws  and the average occurrence of  tail  is once in two
tosses  there is no necessary limit to the sequences of ace or of  tail 
that may occur in an infinite number of trials  to provide for such
cases the curve is drawn as if it never touched the abscissa 

that some such figure as that given above describes a frequent
characteristic of an average with the deviations from it  may be shown
in two ways   1  by arranging the statistical results of any homogeneous
class of measurements  when it is often found that they do  in fact 
approximately conform to the figure  that very many events are near the
average  that errors are symmetrically distributed on either side  and
that the greater errors are the rarer   2  by mathematical demonstration
based upon the supposition that each of the events in question is
influenced  more or less  by a number of unknown conditions common to
them all  and that these conditions are independent of one another  for
then  in rare cases  all the conditions will operate favourably in one
way  and the men will be tall  or in the opposite way  and the men will
be short  in more numerous cases  many of the conditions will operate in
one direction  and will be partially cancelled by a few opposing them 
whilst in still more cases opposed conditions will approximately balance
one another and produce the average event or something near it  the
results will then conform to the above figure 

from the above assumption it follows that the symmetrical curve
describes only a  homogeneous class  of measurements  that is  a class
no portion of which is much influenced by conditions peculiar to itself 
if the class is not homogeneous  because some portion of it is subject
to  peculiar  conditions  the curve will show a hump on one side or the
other  suppose we are tabulating the ages at which englishmen die who
have reached the age of 20  we may find that the greatest number die at
39  19 years being the average expectation of life at 20  and that as
far as that age the curve upwards is regular  and that beyond the age of
39 it begins to descend regularly  but that on approaching 45 it bulges
out some way before resuming its regular descent  thus 

 illustration  fig  12  

such a hump in the curve might be due to the presence of a considerable
body of teetotalers  whose longevity was increased by the peculiar
condition of abstaining from alcohol  and whose average age was 45  6
years more than the average for common men 

again  if the group we are measuring be subject to selection  such as
british soldiers  for which profession all volunteers below a certain
height  say  5 ft  5 in   are rejected   the curve will fall steeply on
one side  thus 

 illustration  fig  13  

if  above a certain height  volunteers are also rejected  the curve will
fall abruptly on both sides  the average is supposed to be 5 ft  8 in 

the distribution of events is described by  some such curve  as that
given in fig  11  but different groups of events may present figures or
surfaces in which the slopes of the curves are very different  namely 
more or less steep  and if the curve is very steep  the figure runs into
a peak  whereas  if the curve is gradual  the figure is comparatively
flat  in the latter case  where the figure is flat  fewer events will
closely cluster about the average  and the deviations will be greater 

suppose that we know nothing of a given event except that it belongs to
a certain class or series  what can we venture to infer of it from our
knowledge of the series  let the event be the cephalic index of an
englishman  the cephalic index is the breadth of a skull √ó 100 and
divided by the length of it  e g  if a skull is 8 in  long and 6 in 
broad   6√ó100 /8=75  we know that the average english skull has an index
of 78  the skull of the given individual  therefore  is more likely to
have that index than any other  still  many skulls deviate from the
average  and we should like to know what is the probable error in this
case  the probable error is the measurement that divides the deviations
from the average in either direction into halves  so that there are as
many events having a greater deviation as there are events having a less
deviation  if  in fig  11 above  we have arranged the measurements of
the cephalic index of english adult males  and if at  o   the average or
mean  the index is 78  and if the line  pa  divides the right side of
the fig  into halves  then  op  is the probable error  if the
measurement at  p  is 80  the probable error is 2  similarly  on the
left hand  the probable error is  op    and the measurement at  p   is
76  we may infer  then  that the skull of the man before us is more
likely to have an index of 78 than any other  if any other  it is
equally likely to lie between 80 and 76  or to lie outside them  but as
the numbers rise above 80 to the right  or fall below 76 to the left  it
rapidly becomes less and less likely that they describe this skull 

in such cases as heights of men or skull measurements  where great
numbers of specimens exist  the average will be actually presented by
many of them  but if we take a small group  such as the measurements of
a college class  it may happen that the average height  say  5 ft  8
in   is not the actual height of any one man  even then there will
generally be a closer cluster of the actual heights about that number
than about any other  still  with very few cases before us  it may be
better to take the median than the average  the median is that event on
either side of which there are equal numbers of deviations  one
advantage of this procedure is that it may save time and trouble  to
find approximately the average height of a class  arrange the men in
order of height  take the middle one and measure him  a further
advantage of this method is that it excludes the influence of
extraordinary deviations  suppose we have seven cephalic indices  from
skeletons found in the same barrow  75 1/2  76  78  78  79  80 1/2  86 
the average is 79  but this number is swollen unduly by the last
measurement  and the median  78  is more fairly representative of the
series  that is to say  with a greater number of skulls the average
would probably have been nearer 78 

to make a single measurement of a phenomenon does not give one much
confidence  another measurement is made  and then  if there is no
opportunity for more  one takes the mean or average of the two  but why 
for the result may certainly be worse than the first measurement 
suppose that the events i am measuring are in fact fairly described by
fig  ii  although  at the outset  i know nothing about them  and that my
first measurement gives  p   and my second  s   the average of them is
worse than  p   still  being yet ignorant of the distribution of these
events  i do rightly in taking the average  for  as it happens  3/4 of
the events lie to the left of  p   so that if the first trial gives  p  
then the average of  p  and any subsequent trial that fell nearer than
 say   s   on the opposite side  would be better than  p   and since
deviations greater than  s   are rare  the chances are nearly 3 to 1
that the taking of an average will improve the observation  only if the
first trial give  o   or fall within a little more than 1/2  p  on
either side of  o   will the chances be against any improvement by
trying again and taking an average  since  therefore  we cannot know the
position of our first trial in relation to  o   it is always prudent to
try again and take the average  and the more trials we can make and
average  the better is the result  the average of a number of
observations is called a  reduced observation  

we may have reason to believe that some of our measurements are better
than others because they have been taken by a better trained observer 
or by the same observer in a more deliberate way  or with better
instruments  and so forth  if so  such observations should be
 weighted   or given more importance in our calculations  and a simple
way of doing this is to count them twice or oftener in taking the
average 

  6  these considerations have an important bearing upon the
interpretation of probabilities  the average probability for any
 general class  or series of events cannot be confidently applied to any
 one instance  or to any  special class  of instances  since this one 
or this special class  may exhibit a striking error or deviation  it
may  in fact  be subject to special causes  within the class whose
average is first taken  and which is described by general characters as
 a man   or  a die   or  a rifle shot   there may be classes marked by
special characters and determined by special influences  statistics
giving the average for  mankind  may not be true of  civilised men   or
of any still smaller class such as  frenchmen   hence life insurance
offices rely not merely on statistics of life and death in general  but
collect special evidence in respect of different ages and sexes  and
make further allowance for teetotalism  inherited disease  etc 
similarly with individual cases  the average expectation for a class 
whether general or special  is only applicable to any particular case if
that case is adequately described by the class characters  in england 
for example  the average expectation of life for males at 20 years of
age is 39 40  but at 60 it is still 13 14  and at 73 it is 7 07  at 100
it s 1 61  of men 20 years old those who live more or less than 39 40
years are deviations or errors  but there are a great many of them  to
insure the life of a single man at 20  in the expectation of his dying
at 60  would be a mere bet  if we had no special knowledge of him  the
safety of an insurance office lies in having so many clients that
opposite deviations cancel one another  the more clients the safer the
business  it is quite possible that a hundred men aged 20 should be
insured in one week and all of them die before 25  this would be
ruinous  if others did not live to be 80 or 90 

not only in such a practical affair as insurance  but in matters purely
scientific  the minute and subtle peculiarities of individuals have
important consequences  each man has a certain cast of mind  character 
physique  giving a distinctive turn to all his actions even when he
tries to be normal  in every employment this determines his personal
equation  or average deviation from the normal  the term personal
equation is used chiefly in connection with scientific observation  as
in astronomy  each observer is liable to be a little wrong  and this
error has to be allowed for and his observations corrected accordingly 

the use of the term  expectation   and of examples drawn from insurance
and gambling  may convey the notion that probability relates entirely to
future events  but if based on laws and causes  it can have no reference
to point of time  as long as conditions are the same  events will be the
same  whether we consider uniformities or averages  we may therefore
draw probable inferences concerning the past as well as the future 
subject to the same hypothesis  that the causes affecting the events in
question were the same and similarly combined  on the other hand  if we
know that conditions bearing on the subject of investigation  have
changed since statistics were collected  or were different at some time
previous to the collection of evidence  every probable inference based
on those statistics must be corrected by allowing for the altered
conditions  whether we desire to reason forwards or backwards in time 

  7  the rules for the combination of probabilities are as follows 

 1  if two events or causes do not concur  the probability of one or the
other occurring is the sum of the separate probabilities  a die cannot
turn up both ace and six  but the probability in favour of each is 1/6 
therefore  the probability in favour of one or the other is 1/3  death
can hardly occur from both burning and drowning  if 1 in 1000 is burned
and 2 in 1000 are drowned  the probability of being burned or drowned is
3/1000 

 2  if two events are independent  having neither connection nor
repugnance  the probability of their concurring is found by multiplying
together the separate probabilities of each occurring  if in walking
down a certain street i meet a once in four times  and b once in three
times  i ought  by mere chance  to meet both once in twelve times  for
in twelve occasions i meet b four times  but once in four i meet a 

this is a very important rule in scientific investigation  since it
enables us to detect the presence of causation  for if the coincidence
of two events is more or less frequent than it would be if they were
entirely independent  there is either connection or repugnance between
them  if  e g   in walking down the street i meet both a and b oftener
than once in twelve times  they may be engaged in similar business 
calling them from their offices at about the same hour  if i meet them
both less often than once in twelve times  they may belong to the same
office  where one acts as a substitute for the other  similarly  if in a
multitude of throws a die turns six oftener than once in six times  it
is not a fair one  that is  there is a cause favouring the turning of
six  if of 20 000 people 500 see apparitions and 100 have friends
murdered  the chance of any man having both experiences is 1/8000  but
if each lives on the average 300 000 hours  the chance of both events
occurring in the same hour is 1/2400000000  if the two events occur in
the same hour oftener than this  there is more than a chance
coincidence 

the more minute a cause of connection or repugnance between events  the
longer the series of trials or instances necessary to bring out its
influence  the less a die is loaded  the more casts must be made before
it can be shown that a certain side tends to recur oftener than once in
six 

 3  the rule for calculating the probability of a dependent event is the
same as the above  for the concurrence of two independent events is
itself dependent upon each of them occurring  my meeting with both a and
b in the street is dependent on my walking there and on my meeting one
of them  similarly  if a is sometimes a cause of b  though liable to be
frustrated   and b sometimes of c  c and b having no causes independent
of b and a respectively   the occurrence of c is dependent on that of b 
and that again on the occurrence of a  hence we may state the rule  if
two events are dependent each on another  so that if one occur the
second may  or may not   and if the second a third  whilst the third
never occurs without the second  nor the second without the first  the
probability that if the first occur the third will  is found by
multiplying together the fractions expressing the probability that the
first is a mark of the second and the second of the third 

upon this principle the value of hearsay evidence or tradition
deteriorates  and generally the cogency of any argument based upon the
combination of approximate generalisations dependent on one another or
 self infirmative   if there are two witnesses  a and b  of whom a saw
an event  whilst b only heard a relate it  and is therefore dependent on
a   what credit is due to b s recital  suppose the probability of each
man s being correct as to what he says he saw  or heard  is 3/4  then
 3/4 √ó 3/4 = 9/16  the probability that b s story is true is a little
more than 1/2  for if in 16 attestations a is wrong 4 times  b can only
be right in 3/4 of the remainder  or 9 times in 16  again  if we have
the approximate generalisations   most attempts to reduce wages are met
by strikes   and  most strikes are successful   and learn  on
statistical inquiry  that in every hundred attempts to reduce wages
there are 80 strikes  and that 70 p c  of the strikes are successful 
then 56 p c  of attempts to reduce wages are unsuccessful 

of course this method of calculation cannot be quantitatively applied if
no statistics are obtainable  as in the testimony of witnesses  and even
if an average numerical value could be attached to the evidence of a
certain class of witnesses  it would be absurd to apply it to the
evidence of any particular member of the class without taking account of
his education  interest in the case  prejudice  or general capacity 
still  the numerical illustration of the rapid deterioration of hearsay
evidence  when less than quite veracious  puts us on our guard against
rumour  to retail rumour may be as bad as to invent an original lie 

 4  if an event may coincide with two or more other independent events 
the probability that they will together be a sign of it  is found by
multiplying together the fractions representing the improbability that
each is a sign of it  and subtracting the product from unity 

this is the rule for estimating the cogency of circumstantial evidence
and analogical evidence  or  generally  for combining approximate
generalisations  self corroboratively   if  for example  each of two
independent circumstances  a and b  indicates a probability of 6 to 1 in
favour of a certain event  taking 1 to represent certainty  1 6/7 is the
improbability of the event  notwithstanding each circumstance  then 1/7
√ó 1/7 = 1/49  the improbability of both proving it  therefore the
probability of the event is 48 to 1  the matter may be plainer if put
thus  a s indication is right 6 times in 7  or 42 in 49  in the
remaining 7 times in 49  b s indication will be right 6 times 
therefore  together they will be right 48 times in 49  if each of two
witnesses is truthful 6 times in 7  one or the other will be truthful 48
times in 49  but they will not be believed unless they agree  and in
the 42 cases of a being right  b will contradict him 6 times  so that
they only concur in being right 36 times  in the remaining 7 times in
which a is wrong  b will contradict him 6 times  and once they will both
be wrong  it does not follow that when both are wrong they will concur 
for they may tell very different stories and still contradict one
another 

if in an analogical argument there were 8 points of comparison  5 for
and 3 against a certain inference  and the probability raised by each
point could be quantified  the total value of the evidence might be
estimated by doing similar sums for and against  and subtracting the
unfavourable from the favourable total 

when approximate generalisations that have not been precisely quantified
combine their evidence  the cogency of the argument increases in the
same way  though it cannot be made so definite  if it be true that most
poets are irritable  and also that most invalids are irritable  a still
greater proportion will be irritable of those who are both invalids and
poets 

on the whole  from the discussion of probabilities there emerge four
principal cautions as to their use  not to make a pedantic parade of
numerical probability  where the numbers have not been ascertained  not
to trust to our feeling of what is likely  if statistics can be
obtained  not to apply an average probability to special classes or
individuals without inquiring whether they correspond to the average
type  and not to trust to the empirical probability of events  if their
causes can be discovered and made the basis of reasoning which the
empirical probability may be used to verify

division and classification


  1  classification  in its widest sense  is a mental grouping of facts
or phenomena according to their resemblances and differences  so as best
to serve some purpose  a  mental grouping   for although in museums we
often see the things themselves arranged in classes  yet such an
arrangement only contains specimens representing a classification  the
classification itself may extend to innumerable objects most of which
have never been seen at all  extinct animals  for example  are
classified from what we know of their fossils  and some of the fossils
may be seen arranged in a museum  but the animals themselves have
disappeared for many ages 

again  things are classed according to their resemblances and
differences  that is to say  those that most closely resemble one
another are classed together on that ground  and those that differ from
one another in important ways  are distributed into other classes  the
more the things differ  the wider apart are their classes both in
thought and in the arrangements of a museum  if their differences are
very great  as with animals  vegetables and minerals  the classing of
them falls to different departments of thought or science  and is often
represented in different museums  zoological  botanical  mineralogical 

we must not  however  suppose that there is only one way of classifying
things  the same objects may be classed in various ways according to
the purpose in view  for gardening  we are usually content to classify
plants into trees  shrubs  flowers  grasses and weeds  the ordinary
crops of english agriculture are distinguished  in settling their
rotation  into white and green  the botanist divides the higher plants
into gymnosperms and angiosperms  and the latter into monocotyledons and
dicotyledons  the principle of resemblance and difference is recognised
in all these cases  but what resemblances or differences are important
depends upon the purpose to be served 

purposes are either  Œ±  special or practical  as in gardening or
hunting  or  Œ≤  general or scientific  as in botany or zoology  the
scientific purpose is merely knowledge  it may indeed subserve all
particular or practical ends  but has no other end than knowledge
directly in view  and whilst  even for knowledge  different
classifications may be suitable for different lines of inquiry  in
botany and zoology the morphological classification is that which gives
the most general and comprehensive knowledge  see huxley   on the
classification of animals   ch  1   most of what a logician says about
classification is applicable to the practical kind  but the scientific
 often called  natural classification    as the most thorough and
comprehensive  is what he keeps most constantly before him 

scientific classification comes late in human history  and at first
works over earlier classifications which have been made by the growth of
intelligence  of language  and of the practical arts  even in the
distinctions recognised by animals  may be traced the grounds of
classification  a cat does not confound a dog with one of its own
species  nor water with milk  nor cabbage with fish  but it is in the
development of language that the progress of instinctive classification
may best be seen  the use of general names implies the recognition of
classes of things corresponding to them  which form their denotation 
and whose resembling qualities  so far as recognised  form their
connotation  and such names are of many degrees of generality  the use
of abstract names shows that the objects classed have also been
analysed  and that their resembling qualities have been recognised
amidst diverse groups of qualities 

of the classes marked by popular language it is worth while to
distinguish two sorts   cf   chap  xix    4   kinds  and those having
but few points of agreement 

but the popular classifications  made by language and the primitive
arts  are very imperfect  they omit innumerable things which have not
been found useful or noxious  or have been inconspicuous  or have not
happened to occur in the region inhabited by those who speak a
particular language  and even things recognised and named may have been
very superficially examined  and therefore wrongly classed  as when a
whale or porpoise is called a fish  or a slowworm is confounded with
snakes  a scientific classification  on the other hand  aims at the
utmost comprehensiveness  ransacking the whole world from the depths of
the earth to the remotest star for new objects  and scrutinising
everything with the aid of crucible and dissecting knife  microscope and
spectroscope  to find the qualities and constitution of everything  in
order that it may be classed among those things with which it has most
in common and distinguished from those other things from which it
differs  a scientific classification continually grows more
comprehensive  more discriminative  more definitely and systematically
coherent  hence the uses of classification may be easily perceived 

  2  the first use of classification is the better understanding of the
facts of nature  or of any sphere of practice   for understanding
consists in perceiving and comprehending the likeness and difference of
things  in assimilating and distinguishing them  and  in carrying out
this process systematically  new correlations of properties are
continually disclosed  thus classification is closely analogous to
explanation  explanation has been shown  chap  xix    5  to consist in
the discovery of the laws or causes of changes in nature  and laws and
causes imply similarity  or like changes under like conditions  in the
same way classification consists in the discovery of resemblances in the
things that undergo change  we may say  subject to subsequent
qualifications  that explanation deals with nature in its dynamic 
classification in its static aspect  in both cases we have a feeling of
relief  when the cause of any event is pointed out  or an object is
assigned its place in a system of classes  the gaping wonder  or
confusion  or perplexity  occasioned by an unintelligible thing  or by a
multitude of such things  is dissipated  some people are more than
others susceptible of this pleasure and fastidious about its purity 

a second use of classification is to aid the memory  it strengthens
memory  because one of the conditions of our recollecting things is 
that they resemble what we last thought of  so that to be accustomed to
study and think of things in classes must greatly facilitate
recollection  but  besides this  a classification enables us easily to
run over all the contrasted and related things that we want to think of 
explanation and classification both tend to rationalise the memory  and
to organise the mind in correspondence with nature 

every one knows how a poor mind is always repeating itself  going by
rote through the same train of words  ideas  actions  and that such a
mind is neither interesting nor practical  it is not practical  because
the circumstances of life are rarely exactly repeated  so that for a
present purpose it is rarely enough to remember only one former case  we
need several  that by comparing  perhaps automatically  their
resemblances and differences with the one before us  we may select a
course of action  or a principle  or a parallel  suited to our
immediate needs  greater fertility and flexibility of thought seem
naturally to result from the practice of explanation and classification 
but it must be honestly added  that the result depends upon the spirit
in which such study is carried on  for if we are too fond of finality 
too eager to believe that we have already attained a greater precision
and comprehension than are in fact attainable  nothing can be more
petrific than  science   and our last state may be worse than the first 
of this  students of logic have often furnished examples 

  3  classification may be either deductive or inductive  that is to
say  in the formation of classes  as in the proof of propositions  we
may  on the whole  proceed from the more to the less  or from the less
to the more general  not that these two processes are entirely
independent 

if we begin with some large class  such as  animal   and subdivide it
deductively into vertebrate and invertebrate  yet the principle of
division  namely  central structure  has first been reached by a
comparison of examples and by generalisation  if  on the other hand 
beginning with individuals  we group them inductively into classes  and
these again into wider ones  as dogs  rats  horses  whales and monkeys
into mammalia  we are guided both in special cases by hypotheses as to
the best grounds of resemblance  and throughout by the general principle
of classification  to associate things that are alike and to separate
things that are unlike  this principle holds implicitly a place in
classification similar to that of causation in explanation  both are
principles of intelligence  here  then  as in proof  induction is
implied in deduction  and deduction in induction  still  the two modes
of procedure may be usefully distinguished  in deduction  we proceed
from the idea of a whole to its parts  from general to special  in
induction  from special  or particular  to general  from parts to the
idea of a whole 

  4  the process of deductive classification  or formal division  may be
represented thus 

                   a
                   |
                             
          |                 |
         a b               a b
          |                 |
                                  
      |        |        |        |
    a b c    a b c    a b c    a b c

given any class  a  to be divided 

1  select one important character  attribute  or quality  b   not common
to all the individuals comprehended in the class  as the basis of
division   fundamentum divisionis   

2  proceed by dichotomy  that is  cut the given class into two  one
having the selected attribute  say  b   the other not having it  b  
this  like all formal processes  assumes the principles of contradiction
and excluded middle  that  no a is both b and not b   and that  every a
is either b or not b   chap  vi    3   and if these principles are not
true  or not applicable  the method fails 

when a class is thus subdivided  it may be called  in relation to its
subclasses  a genus  and in relation to it  the subclasses may be called
species  thus  genus a  species ab and ab  etc 

3  proceed gradually in the order of the importance of characters  that
is  having divided the given class  subdivide on the same principle the
two classes thence arising  and so again and again  step by step  until
all the characters are exhausted   divisio ne fiat per saltum  

suppose we were to attempt an exhaustive classification of things by
this method  we must begin with  all things   and divide them  say  into
phenomenal and not phenomenal  and then subdivide phenomena  and so on 
thus 

                                     all things
                                         |
                                                   
                                 |                |
                             phenomenal    not phenomenal
                                 |
                                            
                        |                  |
                     extended          unextended
                        |       e g   pleasure and pain 
                        |
                                 
                 |              |
             resistant    not resistant
              matter          space 
                 |
                           
        |                 |
   gravitating    not gravitating
        |
              
   |         |
simple    compound

having subdivided  simple  by all possible characters  we must then go
back and similarly subdivide not phenomenal  unextended  not resistant 
not gravitating  and compound  now  if we knew all possible characters 
and the order of their importance  we might prepare  a priori  a
classification of all possible things  at least  of all things that come
under the principles of contradiction and excluded middle  many of our
compartments might contain nothing actual  there may  for example  be
nothing that is not phenomenal to some mind  or nothing that is extended
and not resistant  no vacuum   and so forth  this would imply a breach
of the rule  that the dividing quality be not common to the whole class 
but  in fact  doubts have been  and are  seriously entertained whether
these compartments are filled or not  if they are not  we have concepts
representing nothing  which have been generated by the mere force of
grammatical negation  or by the habit of thinking according to the
principle of excluded middle  and  on the strength of these empty
concepts  we have been misled into dividing by an attribute  which
 being universal  cannot be a  fundamentum divisionis   but though in
such a classification places might be empty  there would be a place for
everything  for whatever did not come into some positive class  such as
gravitating  must fall under one of the negative classes  the  nots  
that run down the right hand side of the table and of its subdivisions 

this is the ideal of classification  unfortunately we have to learn what
characters or attributes are possible  by experience and comparison  we
are far from knowing them all  and we do not know the order of their
importance  nor are we even clear what  important  means in this
context  whether  widely prevalent   or  ancient   or  causally
influential   or  indicative of others   hence  in classifying actual
things  we must follow the inductive method of beginning with
particulars  and sorting them according to their likeness and difference
as discovered by investigation  the exceptional cases  in which
deduction is really useful  occur where certain limits to the number and
combination of qualities happen to be known  as they may be in human
institutions  or where there are mathematical conditions  thus  we might
be able to classify orders of architecture  or the classical metres and
stanzas of english poetry  though  in fact  these things are too free 
subtle and complex for deductive treatment  for do not the arts grow
like trees  the only sure cases are mathematical  as we may show that
there are possible only three kinds of plane triangles  four conic
sections  five regular solids 

  5  the rules for  testing  a division are as follows 

1  each sub class  or species  should comprise less than the class  or
genus  to be divided  this provides that the division shall be a real
one  and not based upon an attribute common to the whole class  that 
therefore  the first rule for making a division shall have been adhered
to  but  as in   4  we are here met by a logical difficulty  suppose
that the class to be divided is a  and that we attempt to divide upon
the attribute b  into ab and ab  is this a true division  if we do not
know any a that is not b  as far as our knowledge extends  we have not
divided a at all  on the other hand  our knowledge of concrete things is
never exhaustive  so that  although we know of no a that is not b  it
may yet exist  and we have seen that it is a logical caution not to
assume what we do not know  in a deductive classification  at least  it
seems better to regard every attribute as a possible ground of division 
hence  in the above division of  all things     not phenomenal  
 extended not resistant    resistant not gravitating   appear as
negative classes  that is  classes based on the negation of an
attribute   although their real existence may be doubtful  but  if this
be justifiable  we must either rewrite the first test of a division
thus   each sub class should  possibly  comprise less than the class to
be divided   or else we must confine the test to  a  thoroughly
empirical divisions  as in dividing colour into red and not red  where
we know that both sub classes are real  and  b  divisions under
demonstrable conditions  as in dividing the three kinds of triangles by
the quality equilateral  we know that it is only applicable to
acute angled triangles  and do not attempt to divide the right angled or
obtuse angled by it 

2  the sub classes taken together should be equal to the class to be
divided  the sum of the species constitutes the genus  this provides
that the division shall be exhaustive  which dichotomy always secures 
according to the principle of excluded middle  because whatever is not
in the positive class  must be in the negative  red and not red include
all colours 

3  the sub classes must be opposed or mutually exclusive  species must
not overlap  this again is secured by dichotomy  according to the
principle of contradiction  provided the division be made upon one
attribute at a time  but  if we attempt to divide simultaneously upon
two attributes  as  musicians  upon  nationality  and  method   we get
what is called a cross division  thus  german musicians    not german  
 classical    not classical   for these classes may overlap  the same
men sometimes appearing in two groups  bach in  german  and  classical  
pergolesi in  not german  and  classical   if  however  we divide
musicians upon these attributes successively  cross division will be
avoided  thus 

                 musicians
                     |

   |          |            |          |
german    not german    german    not german

here no musician will be found in two classes   unless  he has written
works in two styles   or unless  there are works whose style is
undecided  this  unless  or unless  may suggest caution in using
dichotomy as a short cut to the classification of realities 

4  no sub class must include anything that is not comprised in the class
to be divided  the genus comprises all the species  we must not divide
dogs into fox terriers and dog fish 

  6  the process of inductive classification may be represented thus 

given any multitude of individuals to be classified 

 1  place together in groups  or in thought  those things that have in
common the most  the most widely diffused and the most important
qualities 

 2  connect those groups which have  as groups  the greater resemblance 
and separate those that have the greater difference 

 3  demarcate  as forming higher or more general classes  those groups
of groups that have important characters in common  and  if possible  on
the same principle  form these higher classes into classes higher still 
that is to say  graduate the classification upwards 

whilst in division the terms  genus  and  species  are entirely relative
to one another and have no fixed positions in a gradation of classes  it
has been usual  in inductive classification  to confine the term
 species  to classes regarded as lowest in the scale  to give the term
 genera  to classes on the step above  and at each higher step to find
some new term such as  tribe    order    sub kingdom    kingdom   as may
be seen by turning to any book on botany or zoology  if  having fixed
our species  we find them subdivisible  it is usual to call the
sub species  varieties  

suppose an attempt to classify by this method the objects in a
sitting room  we see at a glance carpets  mats  curtains  grates 
fire irons  coal scuttles  chairs  sofas  tables  books  pictures 
musical instruments  etc  these may be called  species   carpets and
mats go together  so do chairs and sofas  so do grates  fire irons  and
coal scuttles and so on  these greater groups  or higher classes  are
 genera   putting together carpets  mats and curtains as
 warmth fabrics   chairs  sofas and tables as  supports   books 
pictures and musical instruments as  means of culture   these groups we
may call orders  sum up the whole as  from the housewife s point of
view   furniture   if we then subdivide some of the species  as books
into poetry  novels  travels  etc   these sub species may be
considered  varieties  

a classification thus made  may be tested by the same rules as those
given for testing a division  but if it does not stand the test  we must
not infer that the classification is a bad one  if the best possible  it
is good  though formally imperfect  whatever faults are found must then
be charged upon the  matter   which is traditionally perverse and
intractable  if  for example  there is a hammock in the room  it must be
classed not with the curtains as a warmth fabric  but with the sofas as
a support  and books and pictures may be classed as  in a peculiar
sense  means of culture  though all the objects in the room may have
been modified and assorted with a view to gratifying and developing good
taste 

  7  the difficulty of classifying natural objects is very great  it is
not enough to consider their external appearance  exhaustive knowledge
of their internal structure is necessary  and of the functions of every
part of their structure  this is a matter of immense research  and has
occupied many of the greatest minds for very many years  the following

variety   african    syrian    cave lion  extinct 

as there is not space enough to tabulate such a classification in full 
i have developed at each step the most interesting groups  vertebrates 
mammalia  monodelphia carnivora  digitigrada  felid√¶  lion  most of the
other groups in each grade are also subdivisible  though some of them
contain far fewer sub classes than others 

to see the true character of this classification  we must consider that
it is based chiefly upon knowledge of existing animals  some extinct
animals  known by their fossils  find places in it  for others new
places have been made  but it represents  on the whole  a cross section 
or cross sections of nature as developing in time  and  in order to give
a just view of the relations of animals  it must be seen in the light of
other considerations  the older systems of classification  and the rules
for making them  seem to have assumed that an actual system of classes 
or of what mill calls  kinds   exists in nature  and that the relations
of kinds in this system are determined by quantity of resemblance in
co inherent qualities  as the ground of their affinity 

  8  darwin s doctrine of the origin of species affects the conception
of natural classification in several ways   1  if all living things are
blood relations  modified in the course of ages according to their
various conditions of life   affinity  must mean  nearness of common
descent   and it seems irrational to propose a classification upon any
other basis  we have to consider the animal  or the vegetable  kingdom
as a family tree  exhibiting a long line of ancestors  and  descended
from them  all sorts of cousins  first  second  third  etc   perhaps
once  twice  or oftener  removed   animals in the relation of first
cousins must be classed as nearer than second cousins  and so on 

but  if we accept this principle  and are able to trace relationship  it
may not lead to the same results as would be reached by simply relying
upon the present  quantity of resemblance   unless we understand this
in a very particular way  for the most obvious features of an animal may
have been recently acquired  which often happens with those characters
that adapt an animal to its habits of life  as the wings of a bat  or
the fish like shape of a dolphin  or as in cases of  mimicry   some
butterflies  snakes  etc   have grown to resemble closely  in a
superficial way  other butterflies and snakes  from which a stricter
investigation widely separates them  and this superficial resemblance is
probably a recent acquisition  for the sake of protection  the imitated
butterflies being nauseous  and the imitated snakes poisonous  on the
other hand  ancient and important traits of structure may  in some
species  have dwindled into inconspicuous survivals or be still found
only in the embryo  so that only great knowledge and sagacity can
identify them  yet upon ancient traits  though hidden  classification
depends  the seal seems nearer allied to the porpoise than to the tiger 
the shrew nearer to the mouse than to the hedgehog  and the tasmanian
wolf looks more like a true wolf  the tasmanian devil more like a
badger  than like a kangaroo  yet the seal is nearer akin to the tiger 
the shrew to the hedgehog  and the tasmanian flesh eaters are marsupial 
like the kangaroo  to overcome this difficulty we must understand the
resemblance upon which classification is based to include resemblance of
causation  that is  the fact itself of descent from common ancestors 
for organic beings  all other rules of classification are subordinate to
one  trace the genealogy of every form 

by this rule we get a definite meaning for the phrase  important or
fundamental attribute  as determining organic classes  namely  most
ancient  or  best serving to indicate community of origin   grades of
classification will be determined by such fundamental characters  and
may correspond approximately to the more general types  now extinct 
from which existing animals have descended 

 2  by the hypothesis of development the fixity of species is
discredited  the lowest grade of a classification is made up not of
well defined types unchanging from age to age  but of temporary species 
often connected by uncertain and indistinct varieties  some of which
may  in turn  if the conditions of their existence alter  undergo such
changes as to produce new species  hence the notion that kinds exist in
organic nature must be greatly modified  during a given period of a few
thousand years  kinds may be recognised  because  under such conditions
as now prevail in the world  that period of time is insufficient to
bring about great changes  but  if it be true that lions  tigers  and
leopards have had a common ancestor  from whose type they have gradually
diverged  it is plain that their present distinctness results only from
the death of intermediate specimens and the destruction of intermediate
varieties  were it possible to restore  by the evidence of fossils  all
the ranks of the great processions that have descended from the common
ancestor  there would nowhere occur a greater difference than between
offspring and parents  and the appearance of kinds existing in nature 
which is so striking in a museum or zoological garden  would entirely
vanish 

a classification  then  as formerly observed  represents a cross section
of nature as developing in time  could we begin at the beginning and
follow this development down the course of time  we should find no
classes  but an ever moving  changing  spreading  branching continuum 
it may be represented thus  suppose an animal  or plant  a  extending
over a certain geographical area  subject to different influences and
conditions of climate  food  hill and plain  wood and prairie  enemies
and rivals  and undergoing modifications here and there in adaptation to
the varying conditions of life  then varieties appear  these varieties 
diverging more and more  become distinct species  ab  ac  ad  ax   some
of these species  the more widely diffused  again produce varieties 
which  in turn become species  abe  abf  adg  adh   from these  again 
abe  abfi  abfj  ac  adhk  adhl  adhm  the extant species  descend 


                     a
                    /|   
                   / |      
                  /  |            
                 /   |             
        /            |              
       ab            ac     ad     ax
       /             |      / 
      /              |     /   
     /               |    /     
   abe    abf        |  adg    adh
   /      /          |         /| 
  /      /           |        / |  
 /      /            |       /  |   
abe   abfi    abfj   ac   adhk adhl adhm


if in this age a classifier appears  he finds seven living species 
which can be grouped into four genera  abe  abf  ac  adh   and these
again into three families  ab  ac  ad   all forming one order  but the
animals which were their ancestors are all extinct  if the fossils of
any of them  say ab  adg and ax  can be found  he has three more
species  one more genus  adg   and one more family  ax   for ac  which
has persisted unchanged  and ax  which has become extinct  are both of
them families  each represented by only one species  it seems necessary
to treat such ancient types as species on a level with extant forms  but
the naturalist draws our attention to their archaic characteristics  and
tries to explain their places in the order of evolution and their
relationships 

but now suppose that he could find a fossil specimen of every generation
 hundreds of thousands of generations   from abfi  etc   up to a 
then  as each generation would only differ from the preceding as
offspring from parents  he would be unable at any point to distinguish a
species  at most  he would observe a slightly marked variety  abfi and
abfj would grow more and more alike  until they became indistinguishable
in abf  abf and abe would merge into ab  ab  ac  ad and ax would merge
into a  hence  the appearance of species is due to our taking
cross sections of time  or comparing forms that belong to periods remote
from one another  like ax  adg  and adhk  or ad  adh and adhk   and this
appearance of species depends upon the destruction of ancestral
intermediate forms 

 3  the hypothesis of development modifies the logical character of
classification  it no longer consists in a direct induction of
co inherent characters  but is largely a deduction of these from the
characters of earlier forms  together with the conditions of variation 
in other words  the definition of a species must  with the progress of
science  cease to be a mere empirical law of co inherence and become a
derivative law of causation  but this was already implied in the
position that causation is the fundamental principle of the explanation
of concrete things  and accordingly  the derivative character of species
or kinds extends beyond organic nature 

  9  the classification of inorganic bodies also depends on causation 
there is the physical classification into solids  liquids  and gases 
but these states of matter are dependent on temperature  at different
temperatures  the same body may exist in all three states  they cannot
therefore be defined as solid  liquid  or gaseous absolutely  but only
within certain degrees of temperature  and therefore as dependent upon
causation  similarly  the geological classification of rocks  according
to relative antiquity  primary  secondary  tertiary  with their
subdivisions   and mode of formation  igneous and aqueous   rests upon
causation  and so does the chemical classification of compound bodies
according to the elements that enter into them in definite proportions 
hence  only the classification of the elements themselves  amongst
concrete things   at present  depends largely upon empirical
coinherence  if the elements remain irresolvable into anything simpler 
the definitions of the co inherent characters that distinguish them must
be reckoned amongst the ultimate uniformities of nature  but if a
definite theory of their origin both generally and severally  whether
out of ether vortices  or groups of electric corpuscles  or whatnot 
shall ever gain acceptance  similarity of genesis or causation will
naturally be the leading consideration in classifying the chemical
elements  to find common principles of causation  therefore  constitutes
the verification of every natural classification  the ultimate
explanation of nature is always causation  the law of causation is the
backbone of the system of experience

  1  precision of thought needs precision of language for the recording
of such thought and for communicating it to others  we can often
remember with great vividness persons  things  landscapes  changes and
actions of persons or things  without the aid of language  though words
are often mixed with such trains of imagery   and by this means may form
judgments and inferences in particular cases  but for general notions 
judgments and inferences  not merely about this or that man  or thing 
but about all men or all kinds of things  we need something besides the
few images we can form of them from observation  even if we possess
generic images  say  of  horse  or  cat   that is  images formed  like
composite photographs  by a coalescence of the images of all the horses
or cats we have seen  so that their common properties stand out and
their differences frustrate and cancel one another   these are useless
for precise thought  for the generic image will not correspond with the
general appearance of horse or cat  unless we have had proportional
experience of all varieties and have been impartially interested in all 
and  besides  what we want for general thought is not a generic image of
the appearance of things  though it were much more definite and fairly
representative than such images ever are  but a general representation
of their important characters  which may be connected with internal
organs  such as none but an anatomist ever sees  we require a symbol
connected with the general character of a thing  or quality  or process 
as scientifically determined  whose representative truth may be trusted
in ordinary cases  or may be verified whenever doubt arises  such
symbols are for most purposes provided by language  mathematics and
chemistry have their own symbols 

  2  first there should be  a name for every important meaning    a  a
nomenclature  or system of the names of all classes of objects  adapted
to the use of each science  thus  in geology there are names for classes
of rocks and strata  in chemistry for the elements and their compounds 
in zoology and botany for the varieties and species of animals and
plants  their genera  families and orders 

to have such names  however  is not the whole aim in forming a
scientific language  it is desirable that they should be systematically
significant  and even elegant  names  like other instruments  ought to
be efficient  and the efficiency of names consists in conveying the most
meaning with the least effort  in botany and zoology this result is
obtained by giving to each species a composite name which includes that
of the genus to which it belongs  the species of felid√¶ given in chap 
xvii    7  are called  felis leo   lion    felis tigris   tiger    felis
leopardus   leopard    felis concolor   puma    felis lyncus   european
lynx    felis catus   wild cat   in chemistry  the nomenclature is
extremely efficient  names of the simpler compounds are formed by
combining the names of the elements that enter into them  as hydrogen
chloride  hydrogen sulphide  carbon dioxide  and these can be given
still more briefly and efficiently in symbols  as hcl  h  2 s  co  2  
the symbolic letters are usually initials of the names of the elements 
as c = carbon  s = sulphur  sometimes of the latin name  when the common
name is english  as fe = iron  each letter represents a fixed quantity
of the element for which it stands  viz   the atomic weight  the
number written below a symbol on the right hand side shows how many
atoms of the element denoted enter into a molecule of the compound 

 b  a terminology is next required  in order to describe and define the
things that constitute the classes designated by the nomenclature  and
to describe and explain their actions 

 i  a name for every integral part of an object  as head  limb 
vertebra  heart  nerve  tendon  stalk  leaf  corolla  stamen  pistil 
plinth  frieze  etc   ii  a name for every metaphysical part or
abstract quality of an object  and for its degrees and modes  as
extension  figure  solidity  weight  rough  smooth  elastic  friable 
the various colours  red  blue  yellow  in all their shades and
combinations and so with sounds  smells  tastes  temperatures  the terms
of geometry are employed to describe the modes of figure  as angular 
curved  square  elliptical  and the terms of arithmetic to express the
degrees of weight  elasticity  temperature  pitch of sound  when other
means fail  qualities are suggested by the names of things which exhibit
them in a salient way  figures by such terms as amphitheatre  bowl like 
pear shaped  egg shaped  colours by lias blue  sky blue  gentian blue 
peacock blue  and similarly with sounds  smells and tastes  it is also
important to express by short terms complex qualities  as harmony 
fragrance  organisation  sex  symmetry  stratification 

 iii  in the explanation of nature we further require suitable names for
processes and activities  as deduction  conversion  verification 
addition  integration  causation  tendency  momentum  gravitation 
aberration  refraction  conduction  affinity  combination  germination 
respiration  attention  association  development 

there may sometimes be a difficulty in distinguishing the terms which
stand for qualities from those that express activities  since all
qualities imply activities  weight  for example  implies gravitation 
and the quality heat is also a kind of motion  the distinction aimed at
lies between a quality as perceived by means of an effect upon our
senses  as weight is resistance to our effort in lifting  heat  a
sensation when we approach fire   and that property of a body which is
conceived to account for its energy  as gravitation that brings a body
to the ground  or physical heat that expands an iron bar or works an
engine   the former class of words  expressing qualities  are chiefly
used in description  the latter class  expressing activities  are
chiefly needed in explanation  they correspond respectively  like
classification and explanation  with the static and dynamic aspects of
nature 

the terms of ordinary language fall into the same classes as those of
science  they stand for things  classes of things  parts  or qualities 
or activities of things  but they are far less precise in their
signification  as long as popular thought is vague its language must be
vague  nor is it desirable too strictly to correct the language whilst
the thought is incorrigible  much of the effect of poetry and eloquence
depends upon the elasticity and indirect suggestiveness of common terms 
even in reasoning upon some subjects  it is a mistake to aim at an
unattainable precision  it is better to be vaguely right than exactly
wrong  in the criticism of manners  of fine art  or of literature  in
politics  religion and moral philosophy  what we are anxious to say is
often far from clear to ourselves  and it is better to indicate our
meaning approximately  or as we feel about it  than to convey a false
meaning  or to lose the warmth and colour that are the life of such
reflections  it is hard to decide whether more harm has been done by
sophists who take a base advantage of the vagueness of common terms  or
by honest paralogists  if i may use the word  who begin by deceiving
themselves with a plausible definiteness of expression  and go on to
propagate their delusions amongst followers eager for systematic insight
but ignorant of the limits of its possibility 

  3  a definition is necessary  if possible  for every scientific name 
to define a name is to give a precise statement of its meaning or
connotation  the name to be defined is the subject of a proposition 
whose predicate is a list of the fundamental qualities common to the
things or processes which the subject denotes  and on account of
possessing which qualities this name is given to them 

thus  a curve is a line of which no part is straight  the momentum of a
moving body is the product of its mass and its velocity  these being
expressed in numbers of certain units   nitrogen is a transparent
colourless gas  atomic weight 14  specific gravity  9713  not readily

that is  a list of qualities not exhaustive  but containing enough to
identify the things denoted by the given name  as if we say that a lion
is  a large tawny beast of prey with a tufted tail   such purposes may
also be served by a description  which is technically  a proposition
mentioning properties sufficient to distinguish the things denoted  but
not the properties that enter into the definition  as if nitrogen be
indicated as the gas that constitutes 4/5 of the atmosphere 

  4  the rules for testing a definition are  i   as to its contents  

 1  it must state the whole connotation of the name to be defined 

 2  it must not include any quality derivative from the connotation 
such a quality is called a proprium  a breach of this rule can do no
positive harm  but it is a departure from scientific economy  there is
no need to state in the definition what can be derived from it  and
whatever can be derived by causation  or by mathematical demonstration 
should be exhibited in that manner 

 3  it must not mention any circumstance that is not a part of the
connotation  even though it be universally found in the things denoted 
such a circumstance  if not derivable from the connotation  is called an
accident  that  for example  the lion at present only inhabits the old
world  is an accident  if a species otherwise like a lion were found in
brazil  it would not be refused the name of lion on the score of
locality  whilst  however  the rules of logic have forbidden the
inclusion of proprium or accident in a definition  in fact the
definitions of natural history often mention such attributes when
characteristic  indeed  definitions of superordinate classes  families
and orders  not infrequently give qualities as generally found in the
subordinate classes  and at the same time mention exceptional cases in
which they do not occur 

ii   as to its expression  

 4  a definition must not include the very term to be defined  nor any
cognate  in defining  lion  we must not repeat  lion   nor use
 leonine   it would elucidate nothing 

 5  it must not be put in vague language 

 6  it must not be in a negative form  if a positive form be obtainable 
we must not be content to say that a lion is  no vegetarian   or  no
lover of daylight   to define a curve as a line  always changing its
direction  may be better than as  in no part straight  

  5  the process of determining a definition is inseparable from
classification  we saw that classification consists in distributing
things into groups according to their likenesses and differences 
regarding as a class those individuals which have most qualities in
common  in doing so we must  of course  recognise the common qualities
or points of likeness  and to enumerate these is to define the name of
the class  if we discover the qualities upon which a class is based by
direct observation and induction  by the same method we discover the
definition of its name 

we saw also that classification is not merely the determination of
isolated groups of things  but a systematic arrangement of such groups
in relation to one another  hence  again  definitions are not
independent  but relative to one another  and  of course  in the same
way as classes are relative  that is to say  as a class is placed in
subordination to higher or more comprehensive groups  so the definition
of its name is subordinate to that of their names  and as a class stands
in contrast with co ordinate classes  those that are in the same degree
of subordination to the same higher groups   so the definition of its
name is in contrast or co ordination with the definitions of their
names  lion is subordinate to  felis   to digitigrade  to carnivore and
so on up to animal  and  beyond the animal kingdom  to phenomenon  it is
co ordinate with tiger  puma  etc   and more remotely it is
co ordinate with dog  jackal  wolf  which come under  canis   a genus
co ordinate with  felis   the definition of lion  therefore  is
subordinate to that of  felis   and to all above it up to phenomenon 
and is co ordinate with that of tiger  and with all species in the same
grade  this is the ground of the old method of definition  per genus et
differentiam  

the genus being the next class above any species  the  differentia  or
difference consists of the qualities which mark that species in addition
to those that mark the genus  and which therefore distinguish it from
all other species of the same genus  in the above definition of lion 
for example  all the properties down to  light and muscular in build 
are generic  that is  are possessed by the whole genus   felis   and the
remaining four  size  colour  tufted tail  and mane in the male  are the
difference or specific properties  because in those points the lion
contrasts with the other species of that genus  differences may be
exhibited thus 

      lion                                    tiger  
size  about 9 1/2 feet from nose   | about 10 feet 
  to tip of tail                   |
colour  tawny                      | warm tawny  striped with black 
tail  tufted                       | tapering 
mane  present in the male          | both sexes maneless 

there are other differences in the shape of the skull  in defining lion 
then  it would have been enough to mention the genus and the properties
making up the difference  because the properties of the genus may be
found by turning to the definition of the genus  and  on the principle
of economy  whatever it is enough to do it is right to do  to define  by
genus and difference  is a point of elegance  when the genus is known 
but the only way of knowing it is to compare the individuals comprised
in it and in co ordinate genera  according to the methods of scientific
classification  it may be added that  as the genus represents ancestral
derivation  the predication of genus in a definition indicates the
remote causes of the phenomena denoted by the name defined  and this way
of defining corresponds with the method of double naming by genus and
species   felis leo    felis tigris   etc    vanessa atalanta  
 vanessa io   etc 

the so called genetic definition  chiefly used in mathematics  is a rule
for constructing that which a name denotes  in such a way as to ensure
its possessing the tributes connoted by the name  thus  for a circle 
take any point and  at any constant distance from it  trace a line
returning into itself  in chemistry a genetic definition of any compound
might be given in the form of directions for the requisite synthesis of
elements 

  6  the chief difficulty in the definition of scientific names consists
in determining exactly the nature of the things denoted by them  as in
classifying plants and animals  if organic species are free growths 
continually changing  however gradually  according as circumstances give
some advantage to one form over others  we may expect to find such
species branching into varieties  which differ considerably from one
another in some respects  though not enough to constitute distinct
species  this is the case  and  consequently  there arises some
uncertainty in collecting from all the varieties those attributes which
are common to the species as a whole  and  therefore  of course 
uncertainty in defining the species  the same difficulty may occur in
defining a genus  on account of the extent to which some of its species
differ from others  whilst having enough of the common character to
deter the classifier from forming a distinct genus on their account  on
the other hand the occurrence of numerous intermediate varieties may
make it difficult to distinguish genera or species at all  even the
kingdoms of plants and animals are hard to discriminate at the lowest
levels of organisation  now  where there is a difficulty of
classification there must be a corresponding difficulty of definition 

it has been proposed in such cases to substitute a type for a
definition  to select some variety of a species  or species of a genus 
as exhibiting its character in an eminent degree  and to regard other
groups as belonging to the same species or genus  according as they
agree more with this type than with other types representing other
species or genera  but the selection of one group as typical implies a
recognition of its attributes as prevailing generally  though not
universally  throughout the species or genus  and to recognise these
attributes and yet refuse to enumerate them in a definition  seems to be
no great gain  to enumerate the attributes of the type as an approximate
definition of the species or genus  true of  most  of the groups
constituting the species or genus  answers the same purpose  is more
explicit  and can mislead no one who really attends to the exposition 
an approximate definition is  indeed  less misleading than the
indication of a type  for the latter method seems to imply that the
group which is now typical has a greater permanence or reality than its
co ordinate groups  whereas  for aught we know  one of the outside
varieties or species may even now be superseding and extinguishing it 
but the statement of a definition as approximate  is an honest
confession that both the definition and the classification are  like a
provisional hypothesis  merely the best account we can give of the
matter according to our present knowledge 

  7  the limits of definition are twofold   a  a name whose meaning
cannot be analysed cannot be defined  this limitation meets us only in
dealing with the names of the metaphysical parts or simple qualities of
objects under the second requisite of a terminology  resistance and
weight  colour and its modes  many names of sounds  tastes  smells  heat
and cold  in fact  whatever stands for an unanalysable perception 
cannot be made intelligible to any one who has not had experience of the
facts denoted  they cannot be defined  but only exemplified  a sort of
genetic definition may perhaps be attempted  as if we say that colour is
the special sensation of the cones of the retina  or that blue is the
sensation produced by a ray of light vibrating about 650 000 000 000 000
times a second  but such expressions can give no notion of our meaning
to a blind man  or to any one who has never seen a blue object  nor can
we explain what heat is like  or the smell of tobacco  to those who have
never experienced them  nor the sound of c 128 to one who knows nothing
of the musical scale 

if we distinguish the property of an object from the sensation it
excites in us  we may define any simple property as  the power of
producing the sensation   the colour of a flower as the power of
exciting the sensation of colour in us  still  this gives no information
to the blind nor to the colour blind  abstract names may be defined by
defining the corresponding concrete  the definition of  human nature  is
the same as of  man   but if the corresponding concrete be a simple
sensation  as blue   this being indefinable  the abstract  blueness  is
also indefinable 

 b  the second limit of definition is the impossibility of exhausting
infinity  which would be necessary in order to convey the meaning of the
name of any individual thing or person  for  as we saw in chap  iv   if
in attempting to define a proper name we stop short of infinity  our
list of qualities or properties may possibly be found in two
individuals  and then it becomes the definition of a class name or
general name  however small the actual class  hence we can only give a
description of that which a proper name denotes  enumerating enough of
its properties to distinguish it from everything else as far as our
knowledge goes 

  8  the five predicables  species  genus  difference  proprium 
accident  may best be discussed in connection with classification and
definition  and in giving an account of classification  most of what has
to be said about them has been anticipated  their name  indeed  connects
them with the doctrine of propositions  for predicables are terms that
may be predicated  classified according to their connotative relation to
the subject of a proposition  that is  according to the relation in
which their connotation stands to the connotation of the subject  
nevertheless  the significance of the relations of such predicates to a
subject is derivative from the general doctrine of classification 

for example  in the proposition  x is y   y must be one of the five
sorts of predicables in relation to x  but of what sort  depends upon
what x  the subject  is  or means  the subject of the proposition must
be either a definition  or a general connotative name  or a singular
name 

if x be a definition  y must be a species  for nothing but a general
name can be predicated of a definition  and  strictly speaking  it is
only in relation to a definition  as subject  that species can be a
predicable  when it is called  species predicabilis   1  

if x be a connotative name  it is itself a species   species
subjicibilis    and the place of the subject of a proposition is the
usual one for species  the predicate  y  may then be related to the
species in three different ways  first  it may be a definition  exactly
equivalent to the species   in fact  nothing else than the species in an
explicit form  the analysis of its connotation  secondly  the predicate
may be  or connote  some  part only  of the definition or connotation of
the species  and then it is either genus  2   or difference  3  
thirdly  the predicate may connote  no part  of the definition  and then
it is either derivable from it  being a proprium  4   or not derivable
from it  being an accident  5   these points of doctrine will be
expanded and illustrated in subsequent pages 

if x be a singular name  deriving connotation from its constituent terms
 chap  iv    2   as  the present emperor of china   it may be treated as
a  species subjicibilis   then that he is  an absolute monarch  
predicates a genus  because that is a genus of  emperor   a part of the
singular name that gives it connotation  that he wears a yellow robe is
a proprium  derivable from the ceremonial of his court  that he is
thirty years of age is an accident 

but if x be a proper name  having no connotation  y must always be an
accident  since there can then be no definition of x  and therefore
neither species  genus  difference  nor proprium  hence  that  john doe
is a man  is an accidental proposition   man  is not here a  species
predicabilis   for the name might have been given to a dog or a
mountain  that is what enables the proposition to convey information  it
would be useless if the proper name implied  humanity  

 species  is most frequently used  as in zoology  for the  class
denoted  by a general name  but in logic it is better to treat it as a
general name used connotatively for the attributes possessed in common
by the things denoted  and on account of which they are regarded as a
class  it is sometimes called the essence    9   in this connotative
sense  a species is implicitly what the definition is explicitly  and
therefore the two are always simply convertible  thus   a plane
triangle   species  is  a figure enclosed by three straight lines 
 definition   clearly we may equally say   a figure enclosed by three
straight lines is a plane triangle   it is a simple identity 

a genus is also commonly viewed denotatively  as a class containing
smaller classes  its species  but in logic it is  again  better to treat
it connotatively  as a name whose definition is part of the definition
of a given species 

a difference is the remainder of the definition of any species after
subtracting a given genus  hence  the genus and difference together make
up the species  whence the method of definition  per genus et
differentiam    ante     5  

whilst in botany and zoology the species is fixed at the lowest step of
the classification  varieties not being reckoned as classes   and the
genus is also fixed on the step next above it  in logic these
predicables are treated as movable up and down the ladder  any lower
class being species in relation to any higher  which higher class 
wherever taken  thus becomes a genus  lion may logically be regarded as
a species of digitigrade  or mammal  or animal  and then each of these
is a genus as to lion  or  again  digitigrade may be regarded as a
species of mammal  or mammal as a species of animal  the highest class 
however  is never a species  wherefore it is called a  summum genus  
and the lowest class is never a genus  wherefore it is called an  infima
species   between these two any step may be either species or genus 
according to the relation in which it is viewed to other classes  and is
then called subaltern  the  summum genus   again  may be viewed in
relation to a  given  universe or  suppositio   that is  any limited
area of existence now the object of attention   or to the  whole 
universe  if we take the animal kingdom as our  suppositio   animal is
the  summum genus   but if we take the whole universe   all things  is
the  summum genus  

 porphyry s tree  is used to illustrate this doctrine  it begins with a
 summum genus    substance   and descends by adding differences  step by
step  to the  infima species    man   it also illustrates division by
dichotomy 

                      substance
                      /        
               corporeal || incorporeal
                         ||
                        body
                        /    
                 animate || inanimate
                         ||
                    living body
                    /          
                sensible || insensible
                         ||
                       animal
                       /     
                rational || irrational
                         ||
                        man
                       //||  
                      // ||   
                     //  ||    
                    //   ||     
                   //    ||      
                  //     ||       
                 //      ||        
          socrates     plato     aristotle 

beginning with  substance   as  summum genus   and adding the
difference  corporeal   we frame the species  body   taking  body  as
the genus and adding the difference  animate   we frame the species
 living body   and so on till  man  is reached  which  being  infima
species   is only subdivisible into individuals  but the division of man
into individuals involves a change of principle  it is a division of the
denotation  not an increase of the connotation as in the earlier steps 
only one side of each dichotomy is followed out in the  tree   if the
other side had been taken  incorporeal substance would be  spirit  
which might be similarly subdivided 

genus and species  then  have a double relation  in denotation the genus
includes the species  in connotation the species includes the genus 
hence the doctrine that by increasing the connotation of a name we
decrease its denotation  if  for example  to the definition of  lion  we
add  inhabiting africa   asiatic lions are no longer denoted by it  on
the other hand  if we use a name to denote objects that it did not
formerly apply to  some of the connotation must be dropped  if  for
example  the name  lion  be used to include  pumas   the tufted tail and
mane can no longer be part of the meaning of the word  since pumas have
not these properties 

this doctrine is logically or formally true  but it may not always be
true in fact  it is logically true  because wherever we add to the
connotation of a name  it is possible that some things to which it
formerly applied are now excluded from its denotation  though we may not
know of any such things  still  as a matter of fact  an object may be
discovered to have a property previously unknown  and this property may
be fundamental and co extensive with the denotation of its name  or even
more widely prevalent  the discovery that the whale is a mammal did not
limit the class  whale   nor did the discovery that lions  dogs  wolves 
etc   walk upon their toes  affect the application of any of these
names 

similarly  the extension of a name to things not previously denoted by
it  may not in fact alter its definition  for the extension may be made
on the very ground that the things now first denoted by it have been
found to have the properties enumerated in its definition  as when the
name  mammal  was applied to whales  dolphins  etc  if  however 
 mammal  had formerly been understood to apply only to land animals  so
that its definition included  at least  popularly  the quality of
 living on the land   this part of the connotation was of course lost
when the denotation came to include certain aquatic animals 

a proprium is an attribute derived from the definition  being either  a 
implied in it  or deducible from it  as  having its three angles equal
to two right angles  may be proved from the definition of a triangle  or
 b  causally dependent on it  as being  dangerous to flocks  results
from the nature of a wolf  and as  moving in an ellipse  results from
the nature of a planet in its relation to the sun 

an accident is a property accompanying the defining attributes without
being deducible from them  the word suggests that such a property is
merely  accidental   or there  by chance   but it only means that we do
not understand the connection 

proprium and accident bear the same relation to one another as
derivative and empirical laws  the predication of a proprium is a
derivative law  and the predication of an accident is an empirical law 
both accidents and empirical laws present problems  the solution of
which consists in reducing them  respectively  to propria and derivative
laws  thus the colour of animals was once regarded as an accident for
which no reason could be given  but now the colour of animals is
regarded as an effect of their nature and habits  the chief determinants
of it being the advantage of concealment  whilst in other cases  as
among brightly coloured insects and snakes  the determinant may be the
advantage of advertising their own noxiousness  if such reasoning is
sound  colour is a proprium  and if so  it cannot  logically  be
included in a definition  but it is better to be judicious than formal  

if the colour of animals is a proprium  we must recognise a distinction
between inseparable and separable propria  according as they do  or do
not  always accompany the essence  for mankind is regarded as one
species  but each colour  white  black or yellow  is separable from it
under different climatic conditions  whilst tigers are everywhere
coloured and striped in much the same way  so that we may consider their
colouring as inseparable  in spite of exceptional specimens black or
white or clouded 

the same distinction may be drawn between accidents   inhabiting asia 
is an inseparable accident of tiger  but a separable accident of lion 
even the occasional characteristics and occupations of individuals are
sometimes called separable accidents of the species  as  of man  being
colour blind  carpentering  or running 

a proprium in the original signification of the term ·º¥Œ¥ŒπŒøŒΩ was peculiar
to a species  never found with any other  and was therefore convertible
with the subject  but this restriction is no longer insisted on 

  9  any predication of a genus  difference or definition  is a verbal 
analytic  or essential proposition  and any predication of a proprium or
accident  is a real  synthetic  or accidental proposition  chap  v   
6   a proposition is called verbal or analytic when the predicate is a
part  or the whole  of the meaning of the subject  and the subject being
species  a genus or difference is part  and a definition is the whole 
of its meaning or connotation  hence such a proposition has also been
called explicative  again  a proposition is called real or synthetic
when the predicate is no part of the meaning of the subject  and  the
subject being species  a proprium or accident is no part of its meaning
or connotation  hence such a proposition has been called ampliative 

as to essential and accidental  these terms are derived from the
doctrine of realism  realists maintain that the essence of a thing  or
that which makes a thing to be what  or of what kind  it is  also makes
everything else of the same kind to be what it is  the essence  they
say  is not proper to each thing or separately inherent in it  but is an
 universal  common to all things of that kind  some hold that the
universal nature of things of any kind is an idea existing  apart from
the things  in the intelligible world  invisible to mortal eye and only
accessible to thought  whence the idea is called a noumenon  that only
the idea is truly real  and that the things  say  trees  bedsteads and
cities  which appear to us in sense perception  and which therefore are
called phenomena  only exist by participating in  or imitating  the idea
of each kind of them  the standard of this school bears the legend
 universalia ante rem  

but others think that the universal does not exist apart from particular
things  but is their present essence  gives them actuality as individual
substances   informs  them  or is their formal cause  and thus makes
them to be what they are of their kind according to the definition  the
universal lion is in all lions  and is not merely similar  but identical
in all  for thus the universal reason thinks and energises in nature 
this school inscribes upon its banners   universalia in re  

to define anything  then  is to discover its essence  whether
transcendent or immanent  and to predicate the definition  or any part
of it  genus or difference   is to enounce an essential proposition  but
a proprium  being no part of a definition  though it always goes along
with it  does not show what a thing is  nor of course does an accident 
so that to predicate either of these is to enounce an accidental
proposition 

another school of metaphysicians denies the existence of universal ideas
or forms  the real things  according to them  are individuals  which 
so far as any of them resemble one another  are regarded as forming
classes  and the only universal is the class name  which is applied
universally in the same sense  hence  they are called nominalists  the
sense in which any name is applied  they say  is derived from a
comparison of the individuals  and by abstraction of the properties they
have in common  and thus the definition is formed   universalia post
rem  is their motto  some nominalists  however  hold that  though
universals do not exist in nature  they do in our minds  as abstract
ideas or concepts  and that to define a term is to analyse the concept
it stands for  whence  these philosophers are called conceptualists 

such questions belong to metaphysics rather than to logic  and the
foregoing is a commonplace account of a subject upon every point of
which there is much difference of opinion 

  10  the doctrine of the predicaments  or categories  is so interwoven
with the history of speculation and especially of logic that  though its
vitality is exhausted  it can hardly be passed over unmentioned  the
predicaments of aristotle are the heads of a classification of terms as
possible predicates of a particular thing or individual  hamilton
  logic   lect  xi   has given a classification of them  which  if it
cannot be found in aristotle  is an aid to the memory  and may be thrown
into a table thus

of topics  generally useful for the analysis and description of an

arrangement  derivation and limitation  why are there just these heads 
and just so many  it has been suggested that they were determined by
grammatical forms  for substance is expressed by a substantive 
quantity  quality and relation are adjectival  where and when 
adverbial  and the remaining four are verbal  it is true that the parts
of speech were not systematically discriminated until some years after
aristotle s time  but  as they existed  they may have unconsciously
influenced his selection and arrangement of the predicaments  where a
principle is so obscure one feels glad of any clue to it   cf   grote s
 aristotle   c  3  and zeller s  aristotle   c  6   but whatever the
origin and original meaning of the predicaments  they were for a long
time regarded as a classification of things  and it is in this sense
that mill criticises them   logic   bk  i  c  3  

if  however  the predicaments are heads of a classification of terms
predicable  we may expect to find some connection with the predicables 
and  in fact  secondary substances are species and genus  whilst the
remaining nine forms are generally accidents  but  again  we may expect
some agreement between them and the fundamental forms of predication
  ante   chap  i    5  and chap  ii   4   substance  whether as the
foundation of attributes  or as genus and species  implies the
predication of co inherence  which is one mode of  co existence  
quantity is predicated as equality  or inequality  a mode of  likeness  
and the other mode of  likeness  is involved in the predication of
quality  relation  indeed  is the abstract of all predication  and ought
not to appear in a list along with special forms of itself   where  is
position  or  co existence  in space  and  when  is position in time  or
 succession   action and passion are the most interesting aspect of
 causation   posture and habit are complex modes of  co existence   but
too specialised to have any philosophic value  now  i do not pretend
that this is what aristotle meant and was trying to say  but if
likeness  co existence  succession and causation are fundamental forms
of predication  a good mind analysing the fact of predication is likely
to happen upon them in one set of words or another 

by kant the word  category  has been appropriated to the highest forms
of judgment  such as unity  reality  substance  and cause  under which
the understanding reduces phenomena to order and thereby constitutes
nature  this change of meaning has not been made without a certain
continuity of thought  for forms of judgment are modes of predication 
but besides altering the lists of categories and greatly improving it 
kant has brought forward under an old title a doctrine so original and
suggestive that it has extensively influenced the subsequent history of
philosophy  at the same time  and probably as a result of the vogue of
the kantian philosophy  the word  category  has been vulgarised as a
synonym for  class   just as  predicament  long ago passed from
scholastic logic into common use as a synonym for  plight   a minister
is said to be  in a predicament   or to fall under the  category of
impostors

definition of common terms


  1  ordinary words may need definition  if in the course of exposition
or argument their meaning is liable to be mistaken  but as definition
cannot give one the sense of a popular word for all occasions of its
use  it is an operation of great delicacy  fixity of meaning in the use
of single words is contrary to the genius of the common vocabulary 
since each word  whilst having a certain predominant character  must be
used with many shades of significance  in order to express the different
thoughts and feelings of multitudes of men in endlessly diversified
situations  and its force  whenever it is used  is qualified by the
other words with which it is connected in a sentence  by its place in
the construction of the sentence  by the emphasis  or by the pitch of
its pronunciation compared with the other words 

clearly  the requisite of a scientific language   that every word shall
have one meaning well defined   is too exacting for popular language 
because the other chief requisite of scientific language cannot be
complied with   that there be no important meaning without a name  
 important meanings   or what seem such  are too numerous to be thus
provided for  and new ones are constantly arising  as each of us pursues
his business or his pleasure  his meditations or the excursions of his
fancy  it is impossible to have a separate term for each meaning  and 
therefore  the terms we have must admit of variable application 

an attempt to introduce new words is generally disgusting  few men have
mastered the uses of half the words already to be found in our classics 
much more would be lost than gained by doubling the dictionary  it is
true that  at certain stages in the growth of a people  a need may be
widely felt for the adoption of new words  such  in our own case  was
the period of the tudors and early stuarts  many fresh words  chiefly
from the latin  then appeared in books  were often received with
reprobation and derision  sometimes disappeared again  sometimes
established their footing in the language  see  the art of english
poetry   ascribed to puttenham   book iii  chap  4  and ben jonson s
 poetaster   act  v  sc  i  good judges did not know whether a word was
really called for  even shakespeare thought  remuneration  and
 accommodate  ridiculous  but such national exigencies rarely arise  and
in our own time great authors distinguish themselves by the plastic
power with which they make common words convey uncommon meanings 

fluid  however  as popular language is and ought to be  it may be
necessary for the sake of clear exposition  or to steady the course of
an argument  to avoid either sophistry or unintentional confusion  that
words should be defined and discriminated  and we must discuss the means
of doing so 

  2  scientific method is applicable  with some qualifications  to the
definition of ordinary words  classification is involved in any problem
of definition  at least  if our object is to find a meaning that shall
be generally acceptable and intelligible  no doubt two disputants may 
for their own satisfaction  adopt any arbitrary definition of a word
important in their controversy  or  any one may define a word as he
pleases  at the risk of being misunderstood  provided he has no
fraudulent intention  but in exposition or argument addressed to the
public  where words are used in some of their ordinary senses  it should
be recognised that the meaning of each one involves that of many
others  for language has grown with the human mind  as representing its
knowledge of the world  this knowledge consists of the resemblances and
differences of things and of the activities of things  that is  of
classes and causes  and as there is such order in the world  so there
must be in language  language  therefore  embodies an irregular
classification of things with their attributes and relations according
to our knowledge and beliefs  the best attempt  known to me  to carry
out this view is contained in roget s  thesaurus   which is a
classification of english words according to their meanings  founded  as
the author tells us  on the models of zoology and botany  it has some of
the requisites of a logical dictionary 

popular language  indeed  having grown up with a predominantly practical
purpose  represents a very imperfect classification philosophically
considered  things  or aspects  or processes of things  that have
excited little interest  have often gone unnamed  so that scientific
discoverers are obliged  for scientific purposes  to invent thousands of
new names  strong interests  on the other hand  give such a colour to
language  that  where they enter  it is difficult to find any
indifferent expressions   consistency  being much prized  though often
the part of a blockhead   inconsistency  implies not merely the absence
of the supposed virtue  but a positive vice   beauty  being attractive
and  ugliness  the reverse  if we invent a word for that which is
neither   plainness   it at once becomes tinged with the ugly  we seem
to love beauty and morality so much as to be almost incapable of
signifying their absence without expressing aversion 

again  the erroneous theories of mankind have often found their way into
popular speech  and their terms have remained there long after the
rejection of the beliefs they embodied  as  lunatic  augury  divination 
spell  exorcism  though  to be sure  such words may often be turned to
good account  besides the interest of preserving their original sense 
language is a record as well as an index of ideas 

language  then  being essentially classificatory  any attempt to
ascertain the meaning of a word  far from neglecting its relations to
others  should be directed toward elucidating them 

every word belongs to a group  and this group to some other larger
group  a group is sometimes formed by derivation  at least so far as
different meanings are marked merely by inflections  as  short  
 shorter    shorten    shortly   but  for the most part  is a conflux of
words from many different sources   repose    depose    suppose  
 impose    propose   are not nearly connected in meaning  but are
severally allied in sense much more closely with words philologically
remote  thus  repose  is allied with  rest    sleep    tranquillity  
 disturbance    unrest    tumult   whilst  depose  is  in one sense 
allied with  overthrow    dismiss    dethrone    restore    confirm  
 establish   and  in another sense  with  declare    attest    swear  
 prove   etc  groups of words  in fact  depend on their meanings  just
as the connection of scientific names follows the resemblance in
character of the things denoted 

words  accordingly  stand related to one another  for the most part 
though very irregularly  as genus  species  and co ordinate species 
taking  repose  as a genus  we have as species of it  though not exactly
co ordinate with one another   tranquillity  with a mental differentia
 repose of mind    rest   whether of mind or body   sleep   with the
differentia of unconsciousness  privative   synonyms are species  or
varieties  wherever any difference can be detected in them  and to
discriminate them we must first find the generic meaning  for which
there may  or may not  be a single word  thus   equality    sameness  
 likeness    similarity    resemblance    identity   are synonyms  but 
if we attend to the ways in which they are actually used  perhaps none
of them can claim to be a genus in relation to the rest  if so  we must
resort to a compound term for the genus  such as  absence of some sort
of difference   then  equality  is absence of difference in quantity 
 sameness  is often absence of difference in quality  though the usage
is not strict   likeness    similarity   and  resemblance   in their
actual use  perhaps  cannot be discriminated  unless  likeness  be the
more concrete   similarity  the more abstract  but they may all be used
compatibly with the recognition of more or less difference in the things
compared  and even imply this   identity  is the absence of difference
of origin  a continuity of existence  with so much sameness from moment
to moment as is compatible with changes in the course of nature  so that
egg  caterpillar  chrysalis  butterfly may be identical for the run of
an individual life  in spite of differences quantitative and
qualitative  as truly as a shilling that all the time lies in a drawer 

co ordinate species  when positive  have the least contrariety  but
there are also opposites  namely  negatives  contradictories and fuller
contraries  these may be regarded as either co ordinate genera or the
species of co ordinate genera  thus   repose  being a genus 
 not repose  is by dichotomy a co ordinate genus and is a negative and
contradictory  then  activity   implying an end in view    motion 
 limited to matter    disturbance   implying changes from a state of
calm    tumult   etc   are co ordinate species of  not repose   and
are therefore co ordinate opposites  or contraries  of the species of
 repose  

as for correlative words  like  master and slave    husband and wife  
etc   it may seem far fetched to compare them with the sexes of the
same species of plants or animals  but there is this resemblance between
the two cases  that sexual names are correlative  as  lioness   and that
one sex of a species  like a correlative name  cannot be defined without
implying the other  for if a distinctive attribute of one sex be
mentioned  as the lion s mane   it is implied that the other wants it 
and apart from this implication the species is not defined  just as the
definition of  master  implies a  slave  to obey 

common words  less precise than the terms of a scientific nomenclature 
differ from them also in this  that the same word may occur in different
genera  thus   sleep  is a species of  repose  as above  but it is also
a species of  unconsciousness   with co ordinate species  swoon  
 hypnotic state   etc  in fact  every word stands under as many
distinct genera  at least  as there are simple or indefinable qualities
to be enumerated in its definition 

  3  partially similar to a scientific nomenclature  ordinary language
has likewise a terminology for describing things according to their
qualities and structure  such is the function of all the names of
colours  sounds  tastes  contrasts of temperature  of hardness  of
pleasantness  in short  of all descriptive adjectives  and all names for
the parts and processes of things  any word connoting a quality may be
used to describe many very different things  as long as they agree in
that quality 

but the quality connoted by a word  and treated as always the same
quality  is often only analogically the same  we speak of a  great 
storm  a  great  man  a  great  book  but  great  is in each case not
only relative  implying small  and leaving open the possibility that
what we call great is still smaller than something else of its kind  but
it is also predicated with reference to some quality or qualities  which
may be very different in the several cases of its application  if the
book is prized for wisdom  or for imagination  its greatness lies in
that quality  if the man is distinguished for influence  or for courage 
his greatness is of that nature  if the storm is remarkable for
violence  or for duration  its greatness depends on that fact  the word
 great   therefore  is not used for these things in the same sense  but
only analogically and elliptically  similarly with good  pure  free 
strong  rich  and so on   rest  has not the same meaning in respect of
a stone and of an animal  nor  strong  in respect of thought and muscle 
nor  sweet  in respect of sugar and music  but here we come to the
border between literal and figurative use  every one sees that
figurative epithets are analogical  but by custom any figurative use may
become literal 

again  many general names of widely different meaning  are brought
together in describing any concrete object  as an animal  or a
landscape  or in defining any specific term  this is the sense of the
doctrine  that any concrete thing is a conflux of generalities or
universals  it may at least be considered in this way  though it seems
more natural to say  that an object presents these different aspects to
a spectator  who  fully to comprehend it  must classify it in every
aspect 

  4  the process of seeking a definition may be guided by the following
maxims 

 1  find the usage of good modern authors  that is  as they rarely
define a word explicitly   consider what in various relations they use
it to denote  from which uses its connotation may be collected 

 2  but if this process yield no satisfactory result  make a list of the
things denoted  and of those denoted by the co ordinate and opposite
words  and observe the qualities in which the things denoted agree  and
in which they differ from those denoted by the contraries and opposites 
if  civilisation  is to be defined  make lists of civilised peoples  of
semi civilised  of barbarous  and of savage  now  what things are common
to civilised peoples and wanting in the others respectively  this is an
exercise worth attempting  if poetry is to be defined  survey some
typical examples of what good critics recognise as poetry  and compare
them with examples of bad  poetry   literary prose  oratory  and
science  having determined the characteristics of each kind  arrange
them opposite one another in parallel columns  whoever tries to define
by this method a few important  frequently occurring words  will find
his thoughts the clearer for it  and will collect by the way much
information which may be more valuable than the definition itself 
should he ever find one 

 3  if the genus of a word to be defined is already known  the process
may be shortened  suppose the genus of poetry to be  belles lettres 
 that is   appealing to good taste    this suffices to mark it off from
science  but since literary prose and oratory are also  belles lettres  
we must still seek the differentia of poetry by a comparison of it with
these co ordinate species  a compound word often exhibits genus and
difference upon its face  as  re turn    inter penetrate  
 tuning fork    cricket bat   but the two last would hardly be
understood without inspection or further description  and however a
definition be discovered  it is well to state it  per genus et
differentiam  

 4  in defining any term we should avoid encroaching upon the meaning of
any of the co ordinate terms  for else their usefulness is lessened  as
by making  law  include  custom   or  wealth  include  labour  or
 culture  

 5  if two or more terms happen to be exactly synonymous  it may be
possible  and  if so  it is a service to the language  to divert one of
them to any neighbouring meaning that has no determinate expression 
thus  wordsworth and coleridge took great pains to distinguish between
imagination and fancy  which had become in common usage practically
equivalent  and they sought to limit  imagination  to an order of poetic
effect  which  they said  had prevailed during the elizabethan age  but
had been almost lost during the gallo classic  and which it was their
mission to restore  co ordinate terms often tend to coalesce and become
synonymous  or one almost supersedes the other  to the consequent
impoverishment of our speech  at present  proposition   that something
is the fact  has almost driven out  proposal   that it is desirable to
co operate in some action   even good writers and speakers  by their own
practice  encourage this confusion  they submit to parliament certain
 propositions   proposals for legislation   or even make  a proposition
of marriage   definition should counteract such a tendency 

 6  we must avoid the temptation to extend the denotation of a word so
far as to diminish or destroy its connotation  or to increase its
connotation so much as to render it no longer applicable to things which
it formerly denoted  we should neither unduly generalise  nor unduly
specialise  a term  is it desirable to define  education  so as to
include the  lessons of experience   or is it better to restrict it as
implying a personal educator  if any word implies blame or praise  we
are apt to extend it to everything we hate or approve  but  coward 
cannot be so defined as to include all bullies  nor  noble  so as to
include every honest man  without some loss in distinctness of thought 

the same impulses make us specialise words  for  if two words express
approval  we wish to apply both to whatever we admire and to refuse both
to whatever displeases us  thus  a man may resolve to call no one great
who is not good  greatness  according to him  connotes goodness  whence
it follows that  say  napoleon i  was not great  another man is
disgusted with greatness  according to him  good and great are mutually
exclusive classes  sheep and goats  as in gray s wretched clench 
 beneath the good how far  yet far above the great   in feet  however
 good  and  great  are descriptive terms  sometimes applicable to the
same object  sometimes to different  but  great  is the wider term and
applicable to goodness itself and also to badness  whereas by making
 great  connote goodness it becomes the narrower term  and as we have
seen    3   such epithets may be applicable to objects on account of
different qualities   good  is not predicated on the same ground of a
man and of a horse 

 7  in defining any word  it is desirable to bear in mind its
derivation  and to preserve the connection of meaning with its origin 
unless there are preponderant reasons for diverting it  grounded on our
need of the word to express a certain sense  and the greater difficulty
of finding any other word for the same purpose  it is better to lean to
the classical than to the vulgar sense of  indifferent    impertinent  
 aggravating    phenomenal  

 8  rigorous definition should not be attempted where the subject does
not admit of it  some kinds of things are so complex in their qualities 
and each quality may manifest itself in so many degrees without ever
admitting of exact measurement  that we have no means of marking them
off precisely from other things nearly allied  similarly complex and
similarly variable  if so we cannot precisely define their names 
imagination and fancy are of this nature  civilisation and barbarism 
poetry and other kinds of literary expression  as to poetry  some think
it only exists in metre  but hardly maintain that the metre must be
strictly regular  if not  how much irregularity of rhythm is admissible 
others regard a certain mood of impassioned imagination as the essence
of poetry  but they have never told us how great intensity of this mood
is requisite  we also hear that poetry is of such a nature that the
enjoyment of it is an end in itself  but as it is not maintained that
poetry must be wholly impersuasive or uninstructive  there seems to be
no means of deciding what amount or prominence of persuasion or
instruction would transfer the work to the region of oratory or science 
such cases make the method of defining by the aid of a type really
useful  the difficulty can hardly be got over without pointing to
typical examples of each meaning  and admitting that there may be many
divergences and unclassifiable instances on the border between allied
meanings 

  5  as science began from common knowledge  the terms of the common
vocabulary have often been adopted into the sciences  and many are still
found there  such as weight  mass  work  attraction  repulsion 
diffusion  reflection  absorption  base  salt  and so forth  in the more
exact sciences  the vague popular associations with such words are
hardly an inconvenience  since those addicted to such studies do not
expect to master them without undergoing special discipline  and  having
precisely defined the terms  they acquire the habit of thinking with
them according to their assigned signification in those investigations
to which they are appropriate  it is in the social sciences  especially
economics and ethics  that the use of popular terminology is at once
unavoidable and prejudicial  for the subject matters  industry and the
conduct of life  are every man s business  and  accordingly  have always
been discussed with a consciousness of their direct practical bearing
upon public and private interests  and therefore in the common language 
in order that everybody may as far as possible benefit by whatever light
can be thrown upon them  the general practice of economists and
moralists  however  shows that  in their judgment  the good derived from
writing in the common vocabulary outweighs the evil  though it is
sometimes manifest that they themselves have been misled by
extra scientific meanings  to reduce the evil as much as possible  the
following precautions seem reasonable 

 1  to try to find and adopt the central meaning of the word  say rent
or money  in its current or traditionary applications  so as to lessen
in the greater number of cases the jar of conflicting associations  but
if the central popular meaning does not correspond with the scientific
conception to be expressed  it may be better to invent a new term 

 2  to define the term with sufficient accuracy to secure its clear and
consistent use for scientific purposes 

 3  when a popular term has to be used in a sense that departs from the
ordinary one in such a way as to incur the danger of misunderstanding 
to qualify it by some adjunct or  interpretation clause  

the first of these rules is not always adhered to  and  in the progress
of a science  as subtler and more abstract relations are discovered
amongst the facts  the meaning of a term may have to be modified and
shifted further and further from its popular use  the term  rent   for
example  is used by economists  in such a sense that they have to begin
the discussion of the facts it denotes  by explaining that it does not
imply any actual payment by one man to another  here  for most readers 
the meaning they are accustomed to  seems already to have entirely
disappeared  difficulties may  however  be largely overcome by
qualifying the term in its various relations  as produce rents 
ground rents  customary rents  and so forth   cf  dr  keynes   scope
and method of political economy   chap  5  

  6  definitions affect the cogency of arguments in many ways  whether
we use popular or scientific language  if the definitions of our terms
are vague  or are badly abstracted from the facts denoted  all arguments
involving these terms are inconclusive  there can be no confidence in
reasoning with such terms  since  if vague  there is nothing to protect
us from ambiguity  or  if their meaning has been badly abstracted  we
may be led into absurdity  as if  impudence  should be defined in such a
way as to confound it with honesty 

again  it is by definitions that we can best distinguish between verbal
and real propositions  whether a term predicated is implied in the
definition of the subject  or adds something to its meaning  deserves
our constant attention  we often persuade ourselves that statements are
profound and important  when  in fact  they are mere verbal
propositions   it is just to give every man his due    the greater good
ought to be preferred to the less   such dicta sound well  indeed  too
well  for  a man s due  means nothing else than what it is just to give
him  and  the greater good  may mean the one that ought to be preferred 
these  therefore  are truisms  the investigation of a definition may be
a very valuable service to thought  but  once found  there is no merit
in repeating it  to put forward verbal or analytic propositions  or
truisms  as information  except  of course  in explaining terms to the
uninstructed   shows that we are not thinking what we say  for else we
must become aware of our own emptiness  every step forward in knowledge
is expressed in a real or synthetic proposition  and it is only by means
of such propositions that information can be given  except as to the
meaning of words  or that an argument or train of reasoning can make any
progress 

opposed to a truism is a contradiction in terms  that is  the denying of
a subject something which it connotes  or which belongs to its
definition   or the affirming of it something whose absence it connotes
 or which is excluded by its definition   a verbal proposition is
necessarily true  because it is tautologous  a contradiction in terms is
necessarily false  because it is inconsistent  yet  as a rhetorical
artifice  or figure  it may be effective  that  the slave is not bound
to obey his master  may be a way of saying that there ought to be no
slaves  that  property is theft   is an uncompromising assertion of the
communistic ideal  similarly a truism may have rhetorical value  that  a
negro is a man  has often been a timely reminder  or even that  a man s
a man   it is only when we fall into such contradiction or tautology by
lapse of thought  by not fully understanding our own words  that it
becomes absurd 

real propositions comprise the predication of propria and accidentia 
accidentia  implying a sort of empirical law  can only be established by
direct induction  but propria are deduced from  or rather by means of 
the definition with the help of real propositions  and this is what is
called  arguing from a definition   thus  if increasing capacity for
co operation be a specific character of civilisation   great wealth  may
be considered as a proprium of civilised as compared with barbarous
nations  for co operation is made most effectual by the division of
labour  and that this is the chief condition of producing wealth is a
real proposition  such arguments from definitions concerning concrete
facts and causation require verification by comparing the conclusion
with the facts  the verification of this example is easy  if we do not
let ourselves be misled in estimating the wealth of barbarians by the
ostentatious  pearl and gold  of kings and nobles  where 99 per cent  of
the people live in penury and servitude  the wealth of civilisation is
not only great but diffused  and in its diffusion its greatness must be
estimated 

to argue from a definition may be a process of several degrees of
complexity  the simplest case is the establishing of a proprium as the
direct consequence of some connoted attribute  as in the above example 
if the definition has been correctly abstracted from the particulars 
the particulars have the attributes summarised in the definition  and 
therefore  they have whatever can be shown to follow from those
attributes  but it frequently happens that the argument rests partly on
the qualities connoted by the class name and partly on many other facts 

in geometry  the proof of a theorem depends not only upon the definition
of the figure or figures directly concerned  but also upon one or more
axioms  and upon propria or constructions already established  thus  in
euclid s fifth proposition  the proof that the angles at the base of an
isosceles triangle are equal  depends not only on the equality of the
opposite sides  but upon this together with the construction that shows
how from the greater of two lines a part may be cut off equal to the
less  the proof that triangles that can be conceived to coincide are
equal  and the axiom that if equals be taken from equals the remainders
are equal  similarly  in biology  if colouring favourable to concealment
is a proprium of carnivorous animals  it is not deducible merely from
their predatory character or any other attribute entering into the
definition of any species of them  but from their predatory character
together with the causes summarised in the phrase  natural selection  
that is  competition for a livelihood  and the destruction of those that
labour under any disadvantages  of which conspicuous colouring would be
one  the particular coloration of any given species  again  can only be
deduced by further considering its habitat  desert  jungle or
snowfield   a circumstance lying wholly outside the definition of the
species 

the validity of an argument based partly or wholly on a definition
depends  in the first place  on the existence of things corresponding
with the definition  that is  having the properties connoted by the name
defined  if there are no such things as isosceles triangles  euclid s
fifth proposition is only formally true  like a theorem concerning the
fourth dimension of space  merely consistent with his other assumptions 
but if there be any triangles only approximately isosceles  the proof
applies to them  making allowance for their concrete imperfection  the
nearer their sides approach straightness and equality the more nearly
equal will the opposite angles be 

again  as to the things corresponding with terms defined  according to
dr  venn  their  existence  may be understood in several senses   1 
merely for the reason  like the pure genera and species of porphyry s
tree  the sole condition of whose being is logical consistency  or  2 
for the imagination  like the giants and magicians of romance  the
heroes of tragedy and the fairies of popular superstition  whose
properties may be discussed  and verified by appeal to the right
documents and authorities  poems and ballads   or  3  for perception 
like plants  animals  stones and stars  only the third class exist in
the proper sense of the word  but under a convention or hypothesis of
existence  we may argue from the definition of a fairy  or a demigod  or
a dragon  and deduce various consequences without absurdity  if we are
content with poetic consistency and the authority of myths and romances
as the test of truth 

in the region of concrete objects  whose properties are causes  and
neither merely fictions nor determinations of space  as in geometry   we
meet with another condition of the validity of any argument depending on
a definition  there must not only be objects corresponding to the
definition  but there must be no other causes counteracting those
qualities on whose agency our argument relies  thus  though we may infer
from the quality of co operation connoted by civilisation  that a
civilised country will be a wealthy one  this may not be found true of
such a country recently devastated by war or other calamity  nor can
co operation always triumph over disadvantageous circumstances 
scandinavia is so poor in the gifts of nature favourable to industry 
that it is not wealthy in spite of civilisation  still  it is far
wealthier than it would be in the hands of a barbarous people  in short 
when arguing from a definition  we can only infer the  tendency  of any
causal characteristics included in it  the unqualified realisation of
such a tendency must depend upon the absence of counteracting causes  as
soon as we leave the region of pure conceptions and make any attempt to
bring our speculations home to the actual phenomena of nature or of
human life  the verification of every inference becomes an unremitting
obligation

fallacies


  1  a fallacy is any failure to fulfil the conditions of proof  if we
neglect or mistake the conditions of proof unintentionally  whether in
our private meditations or in addressing others  it is a paralogism  but
if we endeavour to pass off upon others evidence or argument which we
know or suspect to be unsound  it is a sophism 

fallacies  whether paralogisms or sophisms  may be divided into two
classes   a  the formal  or those that can be shown to conflict with one
or more of the truths of logic  whether deductive or inductive  as if we
attempt to prove an universal affirmative in the third figure  or to
argue that  as the average expectation of life for males at the age of
20 is 19 1/2 years  therefore alcibiades  being 20 years of age  will
die when he is 39 1/2   b  the material  or those that cannot be clearly
exhibited as transgressions of any logical principle  but are due to
superficial inquiry or confused reasoning  as in adopting premises on
insufficient authority  or without examining the facts  or in mistaking
the point to be proved 

  2  formal fallacies of deduction and induction are  all of them 
breaches of the rule  not to go beyond the evidence   as a detailed
account of them would be little else than a repetition of the foregoing
chapters  it may suffice to recall some of the places at which it is
easiest to go astray 

 1  it is not uncommon to mistake the contrary for the contradictory 
as  a is not taller than b  ‚à¥ he is shorter 

 2  to convert  a   or  o   simply  as  

    all money is wealth ‚à¥ all wealth is money 

or  some wealth is not money ‚à¥ some money is not wealth 

in both these cases  wealth  though undistributed in the convertend  is
distributed in the converse 

 3  to attempt to syllogise with two premises containing four terms  as

      the papuans are savages 
      the javanese are neighbours of the papuans 
    ‚à¥ the javanese are savages 

such an argument is excluded by the definition of a syllogism  and
presents no formal evidence whatever  we should naturally assume that
any man who advanced it merely meant to raise some probability that
 neighbourhood is a sign of community of ideas and customs   but  if so 
he should have been more explicit  there would  of course  be the same
failure of connection  if a fourth term were introduced into the
conclusion  instead of into the premises 

 4  to distribute in the conclusion a term that was undistributed in the
premises  an error essentially the same as  2  above   i e   illicit
process of the major or minor term  as  

      every rational agent is accountable 
      brutes are not rational agents 
    ‚à¥ brutes are not accountable 

in this example  from whately   an illegitimate mood of fig  i   the
major term   accountable   has suffered the illicit process  since  in
the premise  it is predicate of an affirmative proposition and 
therefore  undistributed  but  in the conclusion  it is predicate of a
negative proposition and  therefore  distributed  the fact that nearly
everybody would accept the conclusion as true  might lead one to
overlook the formal inconclusiveness of the proof 

again 

      all men are two handed 
      all two handed animals are cooking animals 
    ‚à¥ all cooking animals are men 

here we have bramantip concluding in a   and there is  formally  an
illicit process of the minor  though the conclusion is true  and the
evidence  such as it is  is materially adequate    two handed   being a
peculiar differentia  is nugatory as a middle term  and may be cut out
of both premises  whilst  cooking  is a proprium peculiar to the species
man  so that these terms might be related in u    all men are all
cookers   whence  by conversion   all cookers are men   

 5  to omit to distribute the middle term in one or the other premise 
as  

      all verbal propositions are self evident 
      all axioms are self evident 
    ‚à¥ all axioms are verbal propositions 

this is an illegitimate mood in fig  ii   in which  to give any
conclusion  one premise must be negative  it may serve as a formal
illustration of undistributed middle  though  as both premises are
verbal propositions  it is  materially  not syllogistic at all  but an
error of classification  a confounding of co ordinate species by assuming
their identity because they have the generic attribute in common 

 6  to simply convert an hypothetical proposition  as  

      if trade is free  it prospers 
    ‚à¥ if trade prospers  it is free 

this is similar to the simple conversion of the categorical a   since it
takes for granted that the antecedent is co extensive with the
consequent  or  in other words  that the freedom of trade is the sole
condition of  or  at least  inseparable from  its prosperity 

the same assumption is made if  in an hypothetical syllogism  we try to
ground an inference on the affirmation of the consequent or denial of
the antecedent  as  

    if trade is free it prospers 
      it does prosper 
    ‚à¥ it is free 
      it is not free 
    ‚à¥ it does not prosper 

neither of these arguments is formally good  nor  of course  is either
of them materially valid  if it be possible for trade to prosper in
spite of protective tariffs 

an important example of this fallacy is the prevalent notion  that if
the conclusion of an argument is true the premises must be trustworthy 
or  that if the premises are false the conclusion must be erroneous 
for  plainly  that  

if the premises are true  the conclusion is true  is a hypothetical
proposition  and we argue justly  

        the premises are true 
      ‚à¥ the conclusion is true 
    or  the conclusion is false 
      ‚à¥ the premises are false  or one of them is  

this is valid for every argument that is formally correct  but that we
cannot trust the premises on the strength of the conclusion  nor reject
the conclusion because the premises are absurd  the following example
will show 

      all who square the circle are great mathematicians 
      newton squared the circle 
    ‚à¥ newton was a great mathematician 

the conclusion is true  but the premises are intolerable 

how the taking of contraries for contradictories may vitiate disjunctive
syllogisms and dilemmas has been sufficiently explained in the twelfth
chapter 

  3  formal fallacies of induction consist in supposing or inferring
causation without attempting to prove it  or in pretending to prove it
without satisfying the canons of observation and experiment  as  

 1  to assign the cause of anything that is not a concrete event  as 
e g   why two circles can touch only in one point  we should give the
 reason   for this expression includes  besides evidence of causation 
the principles of formal deduction  logical and mathematical 

 2  to argue  as if on inductive grounds  concerning the cause of the
universe as a whole  this may be called the fallacy of transcendent
inference  since the canons are only applicable to instances of events
that can be compared  they cannot deal with that which is in its nature
unique 

 3  to mistake co existent phenomena for cause and effect  as when a
man  wearing an amulet and escaping shipwreck  regards the amulet as the
cause of his escape  to prove his point  he must either get again into
exactly the same circumstances without his amulet  and be
drowned  according to the method of difference  or  shirking the only
satisfactory test  and putting up with mere agreement  he must show   a 
that all who are shipwrecked and escape wear amulets  and  b  that their
cases agree in nothing else  and  c   by the joint method  that all who
are shipwrecked without amulets are drowned  and even if his evidence 
according to agreement  seemed satisfactory at all these points  it
would still be fallacious to trust to it as proof of direct causation 
since we have seen that unaided observation is never sufficient for
this  it is only by experiment in prepared circumstances that we can
confidently trace sequence and the transfer of energy 

there is the reverse error of mistaking causal connection for
independent co existence  as if any one regards it as merely a curious
coincidence that great rivers generally flow past great towns  in this
case  however  the evidence of connection does not depend merely upon
direct induction 

 4   post hoc  ergo propter hoc   to accept the mere sequence of
phenomena  even though often repeated  as proving that the phenomena are
cause and effect  or connected by causation  this is a very natural
error  for although  the antecedents of a phenomenon being numerous 
most of them cannot be its cause  yet it is among them that the cause
must be sought  indeed  if there is neither time nor opportunity for
analysis  it may seem better to accept any antecedent as a cause  or  at
least  as a sign  of an important event than to go without any guide 
and  accordingly  the vast and complicated learning of omens  augury 
horoscopy and prophetic dreams  relies upon this maxim  for whatever the
origin of such superstitions  a single coincidence in their favour
triumphantly confirms them  it is the besetting delusion of everybody
who has wishes or prejudices  that is  of all of us at some time or
other  for then we are ready to believe without evidence  the fallacy
consists in judging off hand  without any attempt  either by logic or by
common sense  to eliminate the irrelevant antecedents  which may include
all the most striking and specious 

 5  to regard the co effects  whether simultaneous or successive  of a
common cause as standing in the direct relation of cause and effect 
probably no one supposes that the falling of the mercury in his
thermometer causes the neighbouring lake to freeze  true  it is the
antecedent  and  within a narrow range of experience  may be the
invariable antecedent of the formation of ice  but  besides that the two
events are so unequal  every one is aware that there is another
antecedent  the fall of temperature  which causes both  to justify
inductively our belief in causation  the instances compared must agree 
or differ  in one circumstance only  besides the effect   the flowing
tide is an antecedent of the ebbing tide  it is invariably so  and is
equal to it  but it is not the cause of it  other circumstances are
present  and the moon is the chief condition of both flow and ebb  in
several instances  states that have grown outrageously luxurious have
declined in power  that luxury caused their downfall may seem obvious 
and capable of furnishing a moral lesson to the young  hence other
important circumstances are overlooked  such as the institution of
slavery  the corruption and rapacity of officials and tax gatherers  an
army too powerful for discipline  any or all of which may be present 
and sufficient to explain both the luxury and the ruin 

 6  to mistake one condition of a phenomenon for the whole cause  to
speak of an indispensable condition of any phenomenon as the cause of
it  may be a mere conventional abbreviation  and in this way such a mode
of expression is common not only in popular but also in scientific
discussion  thus we say that a temperature of 33¬∞ f  is a cause of the
melting of ice  although that ice melts at 33¬∞ f   must further depend
upon something in the nature of water  for every solid has its own
melting point  as long  then  as we remember that  cause   used in this
sense  is only a convenient abbreviation  no harm is done  but  if we
forget it  fallacy may result  as when a man says that the cause of a
financial crisis was the raising of the rate of discount  neglecting the
other conditions of the market  whereas  in some circumstances  a rise
of the bank rate may increase public confidence and prevent a crisis 

we have seen that the direct use of the canons of agreement and
difference may only enable us to say that a certain antecedent is a
cause or an indispensable condition of the phenomenon under
investigation  if  therefore  it is important to find the whole cause 
we must either experiment directly upon the other conditions  or resort
to the method of residues and deductive reasoning  nor must we be
content  without showing  where such precision is possible  that the
alleged cause and the given phenomenon are equal 

 7  to mistake a single consequence of a given cause for the whole
effect  is a corresponding error  and none so common  nearly all the
mistakes of private conduct and of legislation are due to it  to cure
temporary lassitude by a stimulant  and so derange the liver  to
establish a new industry by protective duties  and thereby impoverish
the rest of the country  to gag the press  and so drive the discontented
into conspiracy  to build an alms house  and thereby attract paupers
into the parish  raise the rates  and discourage industry 

 8  to demand greater exactness in the estimate of causes or effects
than a given subject admits of  in the more complex sciences  biology 
psychology  sociology  it is often impossible to be confident that all
the conditions of a given phenomenon have been assigned  or that all its
consequences have been traced  the causes of the origin of species and
of the great french revolution have been carefully investigated  and
still we may doubt whether they have all been discovered  or whether
their comparative importance has been rightly determined  but it would
be very unreasonable to treat those things as miraculous and
unintelligible  we read in the  ethics   that a properly cultivated mind
knows what degree of precision is to be expected in each science  the
greatest possible precision is always to be sought  but what is possible
depends partly on the nature of the study and partly upon the state of
scientific preparation 

 9  to treat an agent or condition remote in time as an unconditional
cause  for every moment of time gives an opportunity for new
combinations of forces and  therefore  for modifications of the effect 
thus  although we often say that napoleon s russian expedition was the
cause of his downfall  yet the effect was subject to numerous further
conditions  had the natives not burnt moscow  had the winter been
exceptionally mild  had the prussians and austrians not risen against
him  the event might have been very different  it is rash to trace the
liberties of modern europe to the battle of marathon  indeed  our powers
of perception are so unequal to the subtlety of nature  that even in
experimental science there is time for molecular changes to occur
between what we treat as a cause and the effect as we perceive it  and 
in such cases  the strictly unconditional cause has not been discovered 

 10  to neglect the negative conditions to which a cause is subject 
when we say that water boils at 212¬∞ f   we mean  provided the pressure
be the same as that of the atmosphere at about the sea level   for under
a greater pressure water will not boil at that temperature  whilst under
less pressure it boils at a lower temperature  in the usual statement of
a law of causation   disturbing    frustrating    counteracting 
circumstances  that is  negative conditions  are supposed to be absent 
so that the strict statement of such a law  whether for a remote cause 
or for an immediate cause  when only positive conditions are included  
is that the agent or assemblage of conditions   tends  to produce such
an effect  other conditions being favourable  or in the absence of
contrary forces 

 11  it is needless to repeat what has already been said of other
fallacies that beset inductive proof  such as the neglect of a possible
plurality of causes where the effect has been vaguely conceived  the
extension of empirical laws beyond adjacent cases  the chief errors to
which the estimate of analogies and probabilities  or the application of
the principles of classification are liable  and the reliance upon
direct induction where the aid of deduction may be obtained  or upon
observation where experiment may be employed  as to formal fallacies
that may be avoided by adhering to the rules of logical method  this may
suffice 

  4  there remain many ways in which arguments fall short of a tolerable
standard of proof  though they cannot be exhibited as definite breaches
of logical principles  logicians  therefore  might be excused from
discussing them  but out of the abundance of their pity for human
infirmity they usually describe and label the chief classes of these
 extra logical fallacies   and exhibit a few examples 

we may adopt whately s remark  that a fallacy lies either  1  in the
premises  or  2  in the conclusion  or  3  in the attempt to connect a
conclusion with the premises 

 1  now the premises of a sound argument must either be valid
deductions  or valid inductions  or particular observations  or axioms 
in an unsound argument  then  whose premises are supported by either
deduction or induction  the evidence may be reduced to logical rules 
and its failure is therefore a  logical fallacy  such as we have already
discussed  it follows that an extra logical fallacy of the premises must
lie in what cannot be reduced to rules of evidence  that is  in bad
observations    5   or sham axioms    6  

 2  as to the conclusion  this can only be fallacious if some other
conclusion has been substituted for that which was to have been proved
   7  

 3  fallacies in the connection between premises and conclusion  if all
the propositions are distinctly and explicitly stated  become manifest
upon applying the rules of logic  fallacies  therefore  which are not
thus manifest  and so are extra logical  must depend upon some sort of
slurring  confusion  or ambiguity of thought or speech    8  

  5  amongst fallacies of observation  mill distinguishes  1  those of
non observation  where either instances of the presence or absence of
the phenomenon under investigation  or else some of the circumstances
constituting it or attending upon it  though important to the induction 
are overlooked  these errors are implied in the formal fallacies of
induction already treated of in   3  paragraphs  3  to  7   

mill s class  2  comprises fallacies of malobservation  malobservation
may be due to obtuseness or slowness of perception  and it is one
advantage of the physical sciences as means of education  that the
training involved in studying them tends to cure these defects  at
least  within their own range 

but the occasion of error upon which mill most insists  is our proneness
to substitute a hasty inference for a just representation of the fact
before us  as when a yachtsman  eager for marvels  sees a line of
porpoises and takes them for the sea serpent  every one knows what it is
to mistake a stranger for a friend  a leaf for a sparrow  one word for
another  the wonder is that we are not oftener wrong  considering how
small a part present sensation has in perception  and how much of every
object observed is supplied by a sort of automatic judgment  you see
something brown  which your perceptive mechanism classes with the
appearance of a cow at such a distance  and instantly all the other
properties of a cow are supplied from the resources of former
experience  but on getting nearer  it turns out to be a log of wood  it
is some protection against such errors to know that we are subject to
them  and the logician fulfils his duty in warning us accordingly  but
the matter belongs essentially to psychology  and whoever wishes to
pursue it will find a thorough explanation in prof  sully s volume on
 illusions  

another error is the accumulation of useless  irrelevant observations 
from which no proof of the point at issue can be derived  it has been
said that an important part of an inductive inquirer s equipment
consists in knowing what to observe  the study of any science educates
this faculty by showing us what observations have been effective in
similar cases  but something depends upon genius  observation is
generally guided by hypotheses  he makes the right observations who can
frame the right hypotheses  whilst another overlooks things  or sees
them all awry  because he is confused and perverted by wishes 
prejudices or other false preconceptions  and still another gropes about
blindly  noting this and docketing that to no purpose  because he has no
hypothesis  or one so vague and ill conceived that it sheds no light
upon his path 

  6  the second kind of extra logical fallacy lying in the premises 
consists in offering as evidence some assertion entirely baseless or
nugatory  but expressed in such a way as to seem like a general truth
capable of subsuming the proposition in dispute  it is generally known
as  petitio principii   or begging the question  the question may be
begged in three ways 

 1  there are what mill calls fallacies  a priori   mere assertions 
pretending to be self evident  and often sincerely accepted as such by
the author and some infatuated disciples  but in which the cool
spectator sees either no sense at all  or palpable falsity  these sham
axioms are numerous  and probably every one is familiar with the
following examples  that circular motion is the most perfect  that every
body strives toward its natural place  that like cures like  that every
bane has its antidote  that what is true of our conceptions is true of
nature  that pleasure is nothing but relief from pain  that the good 
the beautiful and the true are the same thing  that  in trade  whatever
is somewhere gained is somewhere lost  that only in agriculture does
nature assist man  that a man may do what he will with his own  that
some men are naturally born to rule and others to obey  some of these
doctrines are specious enough  whilst  as to others  how they could ever
have been entertained arouses a wonder that can only be allayed by a
lengthy historical and psychological disquisition 

 2  verbal propositions offered as proof of some matter of fact  these
have  indeed  one attribute of axioms  they are self evident to any one
who knows the language  but as they only dissect the meaning of words 
nothing but the meaning of words can be inferred from them  if anything
further is arrived at  it must be by the help of real propositions  how
common is such an argument as this   lying is wrong  because it is
vicious   the implied major premise being that  what is vicious is
wrong   all three propositions are verbal  and we merely learn from them
that lying is  called  vicious and wrong  and to make that knowledge
deterrent  it must be supplemented by a further premise  that  whatever
is called wrong ought to be avoided   this is a real proposition  but it
is much more difficult to prove it than  that lying ought to be
avoided   still  such arguments  though bad logic  often have a
rhetorical force  to call lying not only wrong but vicious  may be
dissuasive by accumulating associations of shame and ignominy 

definitions  being the most important of verbal propositions  since they
imply the possibility of as many other verbal propositions as there are
defining attributes and combinations of them   need to be watched with
especial care  if two disputants define the same word in different ways 
with each of the different attributes included in their several
definitions they may bring in a fresh set of real propositions as to the
agency or normal connection of that attribute  hence their conclusions
about the things denoted by the word defined  diverge in all directions
and to any extent  and it is generally felt that a man who is allowed to
define his terms as he pleases  may prove anything to those who  through
ignorance or inadvertence  grant that the things that those terms stand
for have the attributes that figure in his definitions 

 3   circulus in demonstrando   the pretence of giving a reason for an
assertion  whilst in fact only repeating the assertion itself  generally
in other words  in such cases the original proposition is  perhaps 
really regarded as self evident  but by force of habit a man says
 because   and then  after vainly fumbling in his empty pocket for the
coin of reason  the habit of symbolic thinking in words only  without
reference to the facts  comes to his rescue  and he ends with a
paraphrase of the same assertion  thus a man may try to prove the
necessity of causation   every event must have a cause  because an event
is a change of phenomena  and this implies a transformation of something
pre existing  which can only have been possible  if there were forces in
operation capable of transforming it   or  again   we ought not to go to
war  because it is wrong to shed blood   but  plainly  if war did not
imply bloodshed  the unlawfulness of this could be nothing against war 
the more serious any matter is  the more important it becomes either to
reason thoroughly about it  or to content ourselves with wholesome
assertions  how many  arguments  are superfluous 

  7  the fallacy of surreptitious conclusion   ignoratio elenchi    the
mistaking or obscuring of the proposition really at issue  whilst
proving something else instead  this may be done by substituting a
particular proposition for an universal  or an universal for a
particular  thus  he who attacks the practice of giving in charity must
not be content to show that it has  in this or that case  degraded the
recipient  who may have been exceptionally weak  or  again  to dissuade
another from giving alms in a particular case  it is not enough to show
that the general tendency of almsgiving is injurious  for  by taking
pains in a particular case  the general tendency may often be
counteracted 

sometimes an argument establishing a wholly irrelevant conclusion is
substituted for an  argumentum ad rem   macaulay complains of those
apologists for charles i  who try to defend him as a king  by urging
that he was a good judge of paintings and indulgent to his wife 

to this class of fallacies belongs the  argumentum ad hominem   which
consists in showing not that a certain proposition is true  but that
critias ought to accept it in consistency with his other opinions  thus 
 in every parish the cost of education ought to be paid out of the
rates  you  at least  have said that there can be no sound economy 
unless local expenses are defrayed from local funds   but whether this
is a fallacy depends  as whately observes  upon whether it is urged as
actually proving the point at issue  or merely as convicting the
opponent of inconsistency  in the latter case  the argument is quite
fair  whatever such a conclusion may be worth 

similarly with the  argumentum ad populum    this measure is favourable
to such or such a class  let them vote for it   an appeal to private
greed  however base  is not fallacious  as long as the interest of the
class is not  fraudulently  substituted for the good of the nation  and
much the same may be said for the  argumentum ad verecundiam   when a
question of morals is debated as a question of honour among thieves 
there is no fallacy  if the moral issue is frankly repudiated  the
argument from authority is often brought under this head   such is the
opinion of aristotle   although this does not establish the truth of any
proposition  it may be fairly urged as a reason for not hastily adopting
a contrary conclusion  that is  if the subject under discussion be one
as to which aristotle  or whoever the authority may be  had materials
for forming a judgment 

a negative use of this fallacy is very common  some general doctrine 
such as positivism  transcendentalism  utilitarianism  or darwinism  is
held in common by a group of men  who  however  all judge independently 
and therefore are likely to differ in details  an opponent exhibits
their differences of opinion  and thereupon pretends to have refuted the
theory they agree in supporting  this is an  argumentum ad scholam   and
pushes too far the demand for consistency  in fact it recoils upon the
sophist  for there is no sense in quoting men against one another 
unless both  or all  are acknowledged to speak with the authority of
learning and judgment  and therefore the general doctrine which they
hold in common is the more confirmed 

this is an example of the paralogism of  proving too much   when a
disputant is so eager to refute an opponent as to lay down  or imply 
principles from which an easy inference destroys his own position  to
appeal to a principle of greater sweep than the occasion requires may
easily open the way to this pitfall  as if a man should urge that  all
men are liars   as the premise of an argument designed to show that
another s assertion is less credible than his own 

a common form of  ignoratio elenchi  is that which whately called the
 fallacy of objections   namely  to lay stress upon all the
considerations against any doctrine or proposal  without any attempt to
weigh them against the considerations in its favour  amongst which
should be reckoned all the considerations that tell against the
alternative doctrines or proposals  incontestable demonstration can
rarely be expected even in science  outside of the mathematics  and in
practical affairs  as butler says   probability is the very guide of
life   so that every conclusion depends upon the balance of evidence 
and to allow weight to only a part of it is an evasion of the right
issue 

  8  fallacies in the connection of premises and conclusion  that cannot
be detected by reducing the arguments to syllogistic form  must depend
upon some juggling with language to disguise their incoherence  they may
be generally described as fallacies of ambiguity  whether they turn upon
the use of the same word in different senses  or upon ellipsis  thus it
may be argued that all works written in a classical language are
classical  and that  therefore  the history of philosophy by diogenes
l√¶rtius  being written in greek  is a classic  such ambiguities are
sometimes serious enough  sometimes are little better than jokes  for
jokes  as whately observes  are often fallacies  and considered as a
prop√¶deutic to the art of sophistry  punning deserves the ignominy that
has overtaken it 

fallacies of ellipsis usually go by learned names  as   1   a dicto
secundum quid ad dictum simpliciter   it has been argued that since 
according to ricardo  the value of goods depends solely upon the
quantity of labour necessary to produce them  the labourers who are
employed upon  say  cotton cloth ought to receive as wages the whole
price derived from its sale  leaving nothing for interest upon capital 
ricardo  however  explained that by  the quantity of labour necessary to
produce goods  he meant not only what is immediately applied to them 
but also the labour bestowed upon the implements and buildings with
which the immediate labour is assisted  now these buildings and
implements are capital  the labour which produced them was paid for  and
it was far enough from ricardo s mind to suppose that the capital which
assists present labour upon  say  cotton cloth has no claim to
remuneration out of the price of it  in this argument  then  the word
labour in the premise is used  secundum quid   that is  with the
suppressed qualification of including past as well as present labour 
but in the conclusion labour is used  simpliciter  to mean present
labour only 

 2   a dicto secundum quid ad dictum secundum alterum quid   it may be
urged that  since the tax on tea is uniform  therefore all consumers
contribute equally to the revenue for their enjoyment of it  but written
out fairly this argument runs thus  since tea is taxed uniformly  4d 
per lb    all consumers pay equally for their enjoyment of it  whatever
quantity they use   these qualifications introduced  nobody can be
deceived 

 3   a dicto simpliciter ad dictum secundum quid   also called  fallacia
accidentis   thus  to take interest upon a loan is perfectly just 
therefore  i do right to exact it from my own father in distress  the
popular answer to this sort of blunder is that  circumstances alter
cases   we commit this error in supposing that what is true of the
average is likely to be true of each case  as if one should say   the
offices are ready to insure my house  with thousands of others  against
fire at a rate per annum which will leave them heavy losers unless it
lasts a hundred years  so  as we are told not to take long views of
life  i shall not insure  

the fallacy of division and composition consists in suggesting  or
assuming  that what is true of things severally denoted by a term is
true of them taken together  that every man is mortal is generally
admitted  but we cannot infer that  therefore  the human race will
become extinct  that the remote prospects of the race are tragic may be
plausibly argued  but not from that premise 

changing the premises is a fallacy usually placed in this division 
although  instead of disguising different meanings under similar words 
it generally consists in using words or phrases ostensibly differing  as
if they were equivalent  those addressed being expected to renounce
their right to reduce the argument to strict forms of proof  as needless
pedantry in dealing with an author so palpably straightforward  if an
orator says   napoleon conquered europe  in other words  he murdered
five millions of his fellow creatures   and is allowed to go on  he may
infer from the latter of these propositions many things which the former
of them would hardly have covered  this is a sort of hyperbole  and
there is a corresponding meiosis  as   mill  admits  that the syllogism
is useful   when  in fact  that is mill s  contention   it may be
supposed that  if a man be fool enough to be imposed upon by such
transparent colours  it serves him right  but this harsh judgment will
not be urged by any one who knows and considers the weaker brethren 

  9  the above classification of fallacies is a rearrangement of the
plans adopted by whately and mill  but fallacies resemble other
spontaneous natural growths in not submitting to precise and definite
classification  the same blunders  looked at from different points of
view  may seem to belong to different groups  thus  the example given
above to illustrate  fallacia accidentis    that  since it is just to
take interest  it is right to exact it from one s own father   may also
be regarded as  petitio principii   if we consider the unconditional
statement of the premise   to take interest upon a loan is perfectly
just   for  surely  this is only conditionally true  or  again  the
first example given of simple ambiguity   that whatever is written in a
classical language is classical  etc    may  if we attend merely to
the major premise  be treated as a bad generalisation  an undue
extension of an inference  founded upon a simple enumeration of the
first few greek and latin works that one happened to remember 

it must also be acknowledged that genuine wild fallacies  roaming the
jungle of controversy  are not so easily detected or evaded as specimens
seem to be when exhibited in a logician s collection  where one surveys
them without fear  like a child at a menagerie  to assume the succinct
mode of statement that is most convenient for refutation  is not the
natural habit of these things  but to give reality to his account of
fallacies an author needs a large space  that he may quote no
inconsiderable part of literature ancient and modern 

as to the means of avoiding fallacies  a general increase of sincerity
and candour amongst mankind may be freely recommended  with more honesty
there would be fewer bad arguments  but there is such a thing as
well meaning incapacity that gets unaffectedly fogged in converting a  
and regards the refractoriness of o   as more than flesh and blood can
endure  mere indulgence in figurative language  again  is a besetting
snare   one of the fathers  in great severity called poesy  vinum
d√¶monum    says bacon  himself too fanciful for a philosopher  surely 
to use a simile for the discovery of truth is like studying beauty in
the bowl of a spoon 

the study of the natural sciences trains and confirms the mind in a
habit of good reasoning  which is the surest preservative against
paralogism  as long as the terms in use are  like those of science  well
defined  and where they are ill defined  so that it is necessary to
guard against ambiguity  a thorough training in politics or metaphysics
may be useful  logic seems to me to serve  in some measure  both these
purposes  the conduct of business  or experience  a sufficient time
being granted  is indeed the best teacher  but also the most austere and
expensive  in the seventeenth century some of the greatest philosophers
wrote  de intellectus emendatione   and if their successors have given
over this very practical inquiry  the cause of its abandonment is not
success and satiety but despair  perhaps the right mind is not to be
made by instruction  but can only be bred  a slow  haphazard process 
and meanwhile the rogue of a sophist may count on a steady supply of
dupes to amuse the tedium of many an age
