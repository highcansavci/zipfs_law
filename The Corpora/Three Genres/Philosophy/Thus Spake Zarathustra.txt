introduction by mrs forster nietzsche 

how zarathustra came into being 

 zarathustra  is my brother s most personal work  it is the history of
his most individual experiences  of his friendships  ideals  raptures 
bitterest disappointments and sorrows  above it all  however  there
soars  transfiguring it  the image of his greatest hopes and remotest
aims  my brother had the figure of zarathustra in his mind from his very
earliest youth  he once told me that even as a child he had dreamt of
him  at different periods in his life  he would call this haunter of his
dreams by different names   but in the end  he declares in a note on
the subject   i had to do a persian the honour of identifying him with
this creature of my fancy  persians were the first to take a broad and
comprehensive view of history  every series of evolutions  according
to them  was presided over by a prophet  and every prophet had his
hazar    his dynasty of a thousand years  

all zarathustra s views  as also his personality  were early conceptions
of my brother s mind  whoever reads his posthumously published writings
for the years 1869 82 with care  will constantly meet with passages
suggestive of zarathustra s thoughts and doctrines  for instance  the
ideal of the superman is put forth quite clearly in all his writings
during the years 1873 75  and in  we philologists   the following
remarkable observations occur  

 how can one praise and glorify a nation as a whole   even among the
greeks  it was the individuals that counted  

 the greeks are interesting and extremely important because they reared
such a vast number of great individuals  how was this possible  the
question is one which ought to be studied 

 i am interested only in the relations of a people to the rearing of
the individual man  and among the greeks the conditions were unusually
favourable for the development of the individual  not by any means owing
to the goodness of the people  but because of the struggles of their
evil instincts 

 with the help of favourable measures great individuals might be reared
who would be both different from and higher than those who heretofore
have owed their existence to mere chance  here we may still be hopeful 
in the rearing of exceptional men  

the notion of rearing the superman is only a new form of an ideal
nietzsche already had in his youth  that  the object of mankind should
lie in its highest individuals   or  as he writes in schopenhauer as
educator    mankind ought constantly to be striving to produce great
men  this and nothing else is its duty    but the ideals he most revered
in those days are no longer held to be the highest types of men  no 
around this future ideal of a coming humanity  the superman  the poet
spread the veil of becoming  who can tell to what glorious heights man
can still ascend  that is why  after having tested the worth of our
noblest ideal  that of the saviour  in the light of the new valuations 
the poet cries with passionate emphasis in  zarathustra  

 never yet hath there been a superman  naked have i seen both of them 
the greatest and the smallest man   

all too similar are they still to each other  verily even the greatest
found i  all too human    

the phrase  the rearing of the superman   has very often been
misunderstood  by the word  rearing   in this case  is meant the act of
modifying by means of new and higher values  values which  as laws and
guides of conduct and opinion  are now to rule over mankind  in general
the doctrine of the superman can only be understood correctly in
conjunction with other ideas of the author s  such as   the order
of rank  the will to power  and the transvaluation of all values  he
assumes that christianity  as a product of the resentment of the botched
and the weak  has put in ban all that is beautiful  strong  proud  and
powerful  in fact all the qualities resulting from strength  and that 
in consequence  all forces which tend to promote or elevate life have
been seriously undermined  now  however  a new table of valuations
must be placed over mankind  namely  that of the strong  mighty  and
magnificent man  overflowing with life and elevated to his zenith  the
superman  who is now put before us with overpowering passion as the
aim of our life  hope  and will  and just as the old system of valuing 
which only extolled the qualities favourable to the weak  the suffering 
and the oppressed  has succeeded in producing a weak  suffering  and
 modern  race  so this new and reversed system of valuing ought to rear
a healthy  strong  lively  and courageous type  which would be a glory
to life itself  stated briefly  the leading principle of this new system
of valuing would be   all that proceeds from power is good  all that
springs from weakness is bad  

this type must not be regarded as a fanciful figure  it is not a
nebulous hope which is to be realised at some indefinitely remote
period  thousands of years hence  nor is it a new species  in the
darwinian sense  of which we can know nothing  and which it would
therefore be somewhat absurd to strive after  but it is meant to be
a possibility which men of the present could realise with all their
spiritual and physical energies  provided they adopted the new values 

the author of  zarathustra  never lost sight of that egregious example
of a transvaluation of all values through christianity  whereby the
whole of the deified mode of life and thought of the greeks  as well as
strong romedom  was almost annihilated or transvalued in a comparatively
short time  could not a rejuvenated graeco roman system of valuing  once
it had been refined and made more profound by the schooling which
two thousand years of christianity had provided  effect another such
revolution within a calculable period of time  until that glorious type
of manhood shall finally appear which is to be our new faith and hope 
and in the creation of which zarathustra exhorts us to participate 

in his private notes on the subject the author uses the expression
 superman   always in the singular  by the bye   as signifying  the most
thoroughly well constituted type   as opposed to  modern man   above
all  however  he designates zarathustra himself as an example of the
superman  in  ecco homo  he is careful to enlighten us concerning the
precursors and prerequisites to the advent of this highest type  in
referring to a certain passage in the  gay science    

 in order to understand this type  we must first be quite clear in
regard to the leading physiological condition on which it depends  this
condition is what i call great healthiness  i know not how to express my
meaning more plainly or more personally than i have done already in
one of the last chapters  aphorism 382  of the fifth book of the  gaya
scienza   

 we  the new  the nameless  the hard to understand    it says
there    we firstlings of a yet untried future  we require for a new end
also a new means  namely  a new healthiness  stronger  sharper  tougher 
bolder and merrier than all healthiness hitherto  he whose soul
longeth to experience the whole range of hitherto recognised values
and desirabilities  and to circumnavigate all the coasts of this ideal
 mediterranean sea   who  from the adventures of his most personal
experience  wants to know how it feels to be a conqueror  and discoverer
of the ideal  as likewise how it is with the artist  the saint  the
legislator  the sage  the scholar  the devotee  the prophet  and the
godly non conformist of the old style   requires one thing above all
for that purpose  great healthiness  such healthiness as one not only
possesses  but also constantly acquires and must acquire  because one
unceasingly sacrifices it again  and must sacrifice it   and now  after
having been long on the way in this fashion  we argonauts of the ideal 
more courageous perhaps than prudent  and often enough shipwrecked
and brought to grief  nevertheless dangerously healthy  always healthy
again   it would seem as if  in recompense for it all  that we have a
still undiscovered country before us  the boundaries of which no one
has yet seen  a beyond to all countries and corners of the ideal known
hitherto  a world so over rich in the beautiful  the strange  the
questionable  the frightful  and the divine  that our curiosity as well
as our thirst for possession thereof  have got out of hand  alas  that
nothing will now any longer satisfy us   

 how could we still be content with the man of the present day
after such outlooks  and with such a craving in our conscience and
consciousness  sad enough  but it is unavoidable that we should look
on the worthiest aims and hopes of the man of the present day with
ill concealed amusement  and perhaps should no longer look at them 
another ideal runs on before us  a strange  tempting ideal full of
danger  to which we should not like to persuade any one  because we
do not so readily acknowledge any one s right thereto  the ideal of
a spirit who plays naively  that is to say involuntarily and from
overflowing abundance and power  with everything that has hitherto
been called holy  good  intangible  or divine  to whom the loftiest
conception which the people have reasonably made their measure of value 
would already practically imply danger  ruin  abasement  or at least
relaxation  blindness  or temporary self forgetfulness  the ideal of
a humanly superhuman welfare and benevolence  which will often enough
appear inhuman  for example  when put alongside of all past seriousness
on earth  and alongside of all past solemnities in bearing  word  tone 
look  morality  and pursuit  as their truest involuntary parody  and
with which  nevertheless  perhaps the great seriousness only commences 
when the proper interrogative mark is set up  the fate of the soul
changes  the hour hand moves  and tragedy begins    

although the figure of zarathustra and a large number of the leading
thoughts in this work had appeared much earlier in the dreams and
writings of the author   thus spake zarathustra  did not actually come
into being until the month of august 1881 in sils maria  and it was the
idea of the eternal recurrence of all things which finally induced my
brother to set forth his new views in poetic language  in regard to his
first conception of this idea  his autobiographical sketch   ecce homo  
written in the autumn of 1888  contains the following passage   

 the fundamental idea of my work  namely  the eternal recurrence of
all things  this highest of all possible formulae of a yea saying
philosophy  first occurred to me in august 1881  i made a note of the
thought on a sheet of paper  with the postscript  6 000 feet beyond
men and time  that day i happened to be wandering through the woods
alongside of the lake of silvaplana  and i halted beside a huge 
pyramidal and towering rock not far from surlei  it was then that the
thought struck me  looking back now  i find that exactly two months
previous to this inspiration  i had had an omen of its coming in the
form of a sudden and decisive alteration in my tastes  more particularly
in music  it would even be possible to consider all  zarathustra  as a
musical composition  at all events  a very necessary condition in its
production was a renaissance in myself of the art of hearing  in a small
mountain resort  recoaro  near vicenza  where i spent the spring of
1881  i and my friend and maestro  peter gast  also one who had been
born again  discovered that the phoenix music that hovered over us  wore
lighter and brighter plumes than it had done theretofore  

during the month of august 1881 my brother resolved to reveal the
teaching of the eternal recurrence  in dithyrambic and psalmodic form 
through the mouth of zarathustra  among the notes of this period  we
found a page on which is written the first definite plan of  thus spake
zarathustra    

 midday and eternity  

 guide posts to a new way of living  

beneath this is written   

 zarathustra born on lake urmi  left his home in his thirtieth year 
went into the province of aria  and  during ten years of solitude in the
mountains  composed the zend avesta  

 the sun of knowledge stands once more at midday  and the serpent
of eternity lies coiled in its light    it is your time  ye midday
brethren  

in that summer of 1881  my brother  after many years of steadily
declining health  began at last to rally  and it is to this first gush
of the recovery of his once splendid bodily condition that we owe not
only  the gay science   which in its mood may be regarded as a prelude
to  zarathustra   but also  zarathustra  itself  just as he was
beginning to recuperate his health  however  an unkind destiny brought
him a number of most painful personal experiences  his friends caused
him many disappointments  which were the more bitter to him  inasmuch as
he regarded friendship as such a sacred institution  and for the first
time in his life he realised the whole horror of that loneliness to
which  perhaps  all greatness is condemned  but to be forsaken is
something very different from deliberately choosing blessed loneliness 
how he longed  in those days  for the ideal friend who would thoroughly
understand him  to whom he would be able to say all  and whom he
imagined he had found at various periods in his life from his earliest
youth onwards  now  however  that the way he had chosen grew ever more
perilous and steep  he found nobody who could follow him  he therefore
created a perfect friend for himself in the ideal form of a majestic
philosopher  and made this creation the preacher of his gospel to the
world 

whether my brother would ever have written  thus spake zarathustra 
 according to the first plan sketched in the summer of 1881  if he
had not had the disappointments already referred to  is now an idle
question  but perhaps where  zarathustra  is concerned  we may also say
with master eckhardt   the fleetest beast to bear you to perfection is
suffering  

my brother writes as follows about the origin of the first part of
 zarathustra     in the winter of 1882 83  i was living on the charming
little gulf of rapallo  not far from genoa  and between chiavari and
cape porto fino  my health was not very good  the winter was cold and
exceptionally rainy  and the small inn in which i lived was so close
to the water that at night my sleep would be disturbed if the sea were
high  these circumstances were surely the very reverse of favourable 
and yet in spite of it all  and as if in demonstration of my belief that
everything decisive comes to life in spite of every obstacle  it was
precisely during this winter and in the midst of these unfavourable
circumstances that my  zarathustra  originated  in the morning i used to
start out in a southerly direction up the glorious road to zoagli  which
rises aloft through a forest of pines and gives one a view far out into
the sea  in the afternoon  as often as my health permitted  i walked
round the whole bay from santa margherita to beyond porto fino  this
spot was all the more interesting to me  inasmuch as it was so dearly
loved by the emperor frederick iii  in the autumn of 1886 i chanced to
be there again when he was revisiting this small  forgotten world
of happiness for the last time  it was on these two roads that all
 zarathustra  came to me  above all zarathustra himself as a type   i
ought rather to say that it was on these walks that these ideas waylaid
me  

the first part of  zarathustra  was written in about ten days  that is
to say  from the beginning to about the middle of february 1883   the
last lines were written precisely in the hallowed hour when richard
wagner gave up the ghost in venice  

with the exception of the ten days occupied in composing the first part
of this book  my brother often referred to this winter as the hardest
and sickliest he had ever experienced  he did not  however  mean thereby
that his former disorders were troubling him  but that he was suffering
from a severe attack of influenza which he had caught in santa
margherita  and which tormented him for several weeks after his arrival
in genoa  as a matter of fact  however  what he complained of most was
his spiritual condition  that indescribable forsakenness  to which he
gives such heartrending expression in  zarathustra   even the reception
which the first part met with at the hands of friends and acquaintances
was extremely disheartening  for almost all those to whom he presented
copies of the work misunderstood it   i found no one ripe for many of my
thoughts  the case of  zarathustra  proves that one can speak with the
utmost clearness  and yet not be heard by any one   my brother was very
much discouraged by the feebleness of the response he was given  and as
he was striving just then to give up the practice of taking hydrate
of chloral  a drug he had begun to take while ill with influenza   the
following spring  spent in rome  was a somewhat gloomy one for him 
he writes about it as follows    i spent a melancholy spring in rome 
where i only just managed to live   and this was no easy matter  this
city  which is absolutely unsuited to the poet author of  zarathustra  
and for the choice of which i was not responsible  made me inordinately
miserable  i tried to leave it  i wanted to go to aquila  the opposite
of rome in every respect  and actually founded in a spirit of enmity
towards that city  just as i also shall found a city some day   as a
memento of an atheist and genuine enemy of the church  a person very
closely related to me   the great hohenstaufen  the emperor frederick
ii  but fate lay behind it all  i had to return again to rome  in the
end i was obliged to be satisfied with the piazza barberini  after i had
exerted myself in vain to find an anti christian quarter  i fear that
on one occasion  to avoid bad smells as much as possible  i actually
inquired at the palazzo del quirinale whether they could not provide a
quiet room for a philosopher  in a chamber high above the piazza just
mentioned  from which one obtained a general view of rome and could
hear the fountains plashing far below  the loneliest of all songs
was composed   the night song   about this time i was obsessed by an
unspeakably sad melody  the refrain of which i recognised in the words 
 dead through immortality   

we remained somewhat too long in rome that spring  and what with the
effect of the increasing heat and the discouraging circumstances already
described  my brother resolved not to write any more  or in any case 
not to proceed with  zarathustra   although i offered to relieve him
of all trouble in connection with the proofs and the publisher  when 
however  we returned to switzerland towards the end of june  and he
found himself once more in the familiar and exhilarating air of the
mountains  all his joyous creative powers revived  and in a note to me
announcing the dispatch of some manuscript  he wrote as follows   i have
engaged a place here for three months  forsooth  i am the greatest fool
to allow my courage to be sapped from me by the climate of italy  now
and again i am troubled by the thought  what next  my  future  is the
darkest thing in the world to me  but as there still remains a great
deal for me to do  i suppose i ought rather to think of doing this than
of my future  and leave the rest to thee and the gods  

the second part of  zarathustra  was written between the 26th of june
and the 6th july   this summer  finding myself once more in the sacred
place where the first thought of  zarathustra  flashed across my mind 
i conceived the second part  ten days sufficed  neither for the second 
the first  nor the third part  have i required a day longer  

he often used to speak of the ecstatic mood in which he wrote
 zarathustra   how in his walks over hill and dale the ideas would crowd
into his mind  and how he would note them down hastily in a note book
from which he would transcribe them on his return  sometimes working
till midnight  he says in a letter to me   you can have no idea of the
vehemence of such composition   and in  ecce homo   autumn 1888  he
describes as follows with passionate enthusiasm the incomparable mood in
which he created zarathustra   

   has any one at the end of the nineteenth century any distinct notion
of what poets of a stronger age understood by the word inspiration  if
not  i will describe it  if one had the smallest vestige of superstition
in one  it would hardly be possible to set aside completely the idea
that one is the mere incarnation  mouthpiece or medium of an almighty
power  the idea of revelation in the sense that something becomes
suddenly visible and audible with indescribable certainty and accuracy 
which profoundly convulses and upsets one  describes simply the matter
of fact  one hears  one does not seek  one takes  one does not ask
who gives  a thought suddenly flashes up like lightning  it comes with
necessity  unhesitatingly  i have never had any choice in the matter 
there is an ecstasy such that the immense strain of it is sometimes
relaxed by a flood of tears  along with which one s steps either rush
or involuntarily lag  alternately  there is the feeling that one is
completely out of hand  with the very distinct consciousness of an
endless number of fine thrills and quiverings to the very toes   there
is a depth of happiness in which the painfullest and gloomiest do not
operate as antitheses  but as conditioned  as demanded in the sense of
necessary shades of colour in such an overflow of light  there is an
instinct for rhythmic relations which embraces wide areas of forms
 length  the need of a wide embracing rhythm  is almost the measure of
the force of an inspiration  a sort of counterpart to its pressure and
tension   everything happens quite involuntarily  as if in a tempestuous
outburst of freedom  of absoluteness  of power and divinity  the
involuntariness of the figures and similes is the most remarkable
thing  one loses all perception of what constitutes the figure and
what constitutes the simile  everything seems to present itself as
the readiest  the correctest and the simplest means of expression 
it actually seems  to use one of zarathustra s own phrases  as if all
things came unto one  and would fain be similes   here do all things
come caressingly to thy talk and flatter thee  for they want to ride
upon thy back  on every simile dost thou here ride to every truth  here
fly open unto thee all being s words and word cabinets  here all being
wanteth to become words  here all becoming wanteth to learn of thee how
to talk   this is my experience of inspiration  i do not doubt but that
one would have to go back thousands of years in order to find some one
who could say to me  it is mine also    

in the autumn of 1883 my brother left the engadine for germany and
stayed there a few weeks  in the following winter  after wandering
somewhat erratically through stresa  genoa  and spezia  he landed in
nice  where the climate so happily promoted his creative powers that
he wrote the third part of  zarathustra    in the winter  beneath the
halcyon sky of nice  which then looked down upon me for the first time
in my life  i found the third  zarathustra   and came to the end of my
task  the whole having occupied me scarcely a year  many hidden corners
and heights in the landscapes round about nice are hallowed to me by
unforgettable moments  that decisive chapter entitled  old and new
tables  was composed in the very difficult ascent from the station
to eza  that wonderful moorish village in the rocks  my most creative
moments were always accompanied by unusual muscular activity  the body
is inspired  let us waive the question of the  soul   i might often have
been seen dancing in those days  without a suggestion of fatigue i could
then walk for seven or eight hours on end among the hills  i slept well
and laughed well  i was perfectly robust and patient  

as we have seen  each of the three parts of  zarathustra  was written 
after a more or less short period of preparation  in about ten days 
the composition of the fourth part alone was broken by occasional
interruptions  the first notes relating to this part were written while
he and i were staying together in zurich in september 1884  in the
following november  while staying at mentone  he began to elaborate
these notes  and after a long pause  finished the manuscript at nice
between the end of january and the middle of february 1885  my brother
then called this part the fourth and last  but even before  and shortly
after it had been privately printed  he wrote to me saying that he still
intended writing a fifth and sixth part  and notes relating to these
parts are now in my possession  this fourth part  the original ms  of
which contains this note   only for my friends  not for the public  
is written in a particularly personal spirit  and those few to whom he
presented a copy of it  he pledged to the strictest secrecy concerning
its contents  he often thought of making this fourth part public also 
but doubted whether he would ever be able to do so without considerably
altering certain portions of it  at all events he resolved to distribute
this manuscript production  of which only forty copies were printed 
only among those who had proved themselves worthy of it  and it speaks
eloquently of his utter loneliness and need of sympathy in those days 
that he had occasion to present only seven copies of his book according
to this resolution 

already at the beginning of this history i hinted at the reasons which
led my brother to select a persian as the incarnation of his ideal of
the majestic philosopher  his reasons  however  for choosing zarathustra
of all others to be his mouthpiece  he gives us in the following
words    people have never asked me  as they should have done  what the
name zarathustra precisely means in my mouth  in the mouth of the first
immoralist  for what distinguishes that philosopher from all others
in the past is the very fact that he was exactly the reverse of an
immoralist  zarathustra was the first to see in the struggle between
good and evil the essential wheel in the working of things  the
translation of morality into the metaphysical  as force  cause  end in
itself  was his work  but the very question suggests its own answer 
zarathustra created the most portentous error  morality  consequently he
should also be the first to perceive that error  not only because he
has had longer and greater experience of the subject than any other
thinker  all history is the experimental refutation of the theory of
the so called moral order of things   the more important point is that
zarathustra was more truthful than any other thinker  in his teaching
alone do we meet with truthfulness upheld as the highest virtue  i e  
the reverse of the cowardice of the  idealist  who flees from reality 
zarathustra had more courage in his body than any other thinker before
or after him  to tell the truth and to aim straight  that is the first
persian virtue  am i understood     the overcoming of morality through

zarathustra s prologue 


1 

when zarathustra was thirty years old  he left his home and the lake of
his home  and went into the mountains  there he enjoyed his spirit and
solitude  and for ten years did not weary of it  but at last his heart
changed   and rising one morning with the rosy dawn  he went before the
sun  and spake thus unto it 

thou great star  what would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for
whom thou shinest 

for ten years hast thou climbed hither unto my cave  thou wouldst have
wearied of thy light and of the journey  had it not been for me  mine
eagle  and my serpent 

but we awaited thee every morning  took from thee thine overflow and
blessed thee for it 

lo  i am weary of my wisdom  like the bee that hath gathered too much
honey  i need hands outstretched to take it 

i would fain bestow and distribute  until the wise have once more become
joyous in their folly  and the poor happy in their riches 

therefore must i descend into the deep  as thou doest in the
evening  when thou goest behind the sea  and givest light also to the
nether world  thou exuberant star 

like thee must i go down  as men say  to whom i shall descend 

bless me  then  thou tranquil eye  that canst behold even the greatest
happiness without envy 

bless the cup that is about to overflow  that the water may flow golden
out of it  and carry everywhere the reflection of thy bliss 

lo  this cup is again going to empty itself  and zarathustra is again
going to be a man 

thus began zarathustra s down going 

2 

zarathustra went down the mountain alone  no one meeting him  when he
entered the forest  however  there suddenly stood before him an old man 
who had left his holy cot to seek roots  and thus spake the old man to
zarathustra 

 no stranger to me is this wanderer  many years ago passed he by 
zarathustra he was called  but he hath altered 

then thou carriedst thine ashes into the mountains  wilt thou now carry
thy fire into the valleys  fearest thou not the incendiary s doom 

yea  i recognise zarathustra  pure is his eye  and no loathing lurketh
about his mouth  goeth he not along like a dancer 

altered is zarathustra  a child hath zarathustra become  an awakened one
is zarathustra  what wilt thou do in the land of the sleepers 

as in the sea hast thou lived in solitude  and it hath borne thee up 
alas  wilt thou now go ashore  alas  wilt thou again drag thy body
thyself  

zarathustra answered   i love mankind  

 why   said the saint   did i go into the forest and the desert  was it
not because i loved men far too well 

now i love god  men  i do not love  man is a thing too imperfect for me 
love to man would be fatal to me  

zarathustra answered   what spake i of love  i am bringing gifts unto
men  

 give them nothing   said the saint   take rather part of their load 
and carry it along with them  that will be most agreeable unto them  if
only it be agreeable unto thee 

if  however  thou wilt give unto them  give them no more than an alms 
and let them also beg for it  

 no   replied zarathustra   i give no alms  i am not poor enough for
that  

the saint laughed at zarathustra  and spake thus   then see to it that
they accept thy treasures  they are distrustful of anchorites  and do
not believe that we come with gifts 

the fall of our footsteps ringeth too hollow through their streets  and
just as at night  when they are in bed and hear a man abroad long before
sunrise  so they ask themselves concerning us  where goeth the thief 

go not to men  but stay in the forest  go rather to the animals  why not
be like me  a bear amongst bears  a bird amongst birds  

 and what doeth the saint in the forest   asked zarathustra 

the saint answered   i make hymns and sing them  and in making hymns i
laugh and weep and mumble  thus do i praise god 

with singing  weeping  laughing  and mumbling do i praise the god who is
my god  but what dost thou bring us as a gift  

when zarathustra had heard these words  he bowed to the saint and said 
 what should i have to give thee  let me rather hurry hence lest i take
aught away from thee    and thus they parted from one another  the old
man and zarathustra  laughing like schoolboys 

when zarathustra was alone  however  he said to his heart   could it be
possible  this old saint in the forest hath not yet heard of it  that
god is dead  

3 

when zarathustra arrived at the nearest town which adjoineth the forest 
he found many people assembled in the market place  for it had been
announced that a rope dancer would give a performance  and zarathustra
spake thus unto the people 

i teach you the superman  man is something that is to be surpassed  what
have ye done to surpass man 

all beings hitherto have created something beyond themselves  and ye
want to be the ebb of that great tide  and would rather go back to the
beast than surpass man 

what is the ape to man  a laughing stock  a thing of shame  and just the
same shall man be to the superman  a laughing stock  a thing of shame 

ye have made your way from the worm to man  and much within you is still
worm  once were ye apes  and even yet man is more of an ape than any of
the apes 

even the wisest among you is only a disharmony and hybrid of plant and
phantom  but do i bid you become phantoms or plants 

lo  i teach you the superman 

the superman is the meaning of the earth  let your will say  the
superman shall be the meaning of the earth 

i conjure you  my brethren  remain true to the earth  and believe not
those who speak unto you of superearthly hopes  poisoners are they 
whether they know it or not 

despisers of life are they  decaying ones and poisoned ones themselves 
of whom the earth is weary  so away with them 

once blasphemy against god was the greatest blasphemy  but god died 
and therewith also those blasphemers  to blaspheme the earth is now the
dreadfulest sin  and to rate the heart of the unknowable higher than the
meaning of the earth 

once the soul looked contemptuously on the body  and then that contempt
was the supreme thing   the soul wished the body meagre  ghastly  and
famished  thus it thought to escape from the body and the earth 

oh  that soul was itself meagre  ghastly  and famished  and cruelty was
the delight of that soul 

but ye  also  my brethren  tell me  what doth your body say about
your soul  is your soul not poverty and pollution and wretched
self complacency 

verily  a polluted stream is man  one must be a sea  to receive a
polluted stream without becoming impure 

lo  i teach you the superman  he is that sea  in him can your great
contempt be submerged 

what is the greatest thing ye can experience  it is the hour of great
contempt  the hour in which even your happiness becometh loathsome unto
you  and so also your reason and virtue 

the hour when ye say   what good is my happiness  it is poverty and
pollution and wretched self complacency  but my happiness should justify
existence itself  

the hour when ye say   what good is my reason  doth it long for
knowledge as the lion for his food  it is poverty and pollution and
wretched self complacency  

the hour when ye say   what good is my virtue  as yet it hath not made
me passionate  how weary i am of my good and my bad  it is all poverty
and pollution and wretched self complacency  

the hour when ye say   what good is my justice  i do not see that i am
fervour and fuel  the just  however  are fervour and fuel  

the hour when ye say   what good is my pity  is not pity the cross on
which he is nailed who loveth man  but my pity is not a crucifixion  

have ye ever spoken thus  have ye ever cried thus  ah  would that i had
heard you crying thus 

it is not your sin  it is your self satisfaction that crieth unto
heaven  your very sparingness in sin crieth unto heaven 

where is the lightning to lick you with its tongue  where is the frenzy
with which ye should be inoculated 

lo  i teach you the superman  he is that lightning  he is that frenzy   

when zarathustra had thus spoken  one of the people called out   we have
now heard enough of the rope dancer  it is time now for us to see him  
 and all the people laughed at zarathustra  but the rope dancer  who
thought the words applied to him  began his performance 

4 

zarathustra  however  looked at the people and wondered  then he spake
thus 

man is a rope stretched between the animal and the superman  a rope over
an abyss 

a dangerous crossing  a dangerous wayfaring  a dangerous looking back  a
dangerous trembling and halting 

what is great in man is that he is a bridge and not a goal  what is
lovable in man is that he is an over going and a down going 

i love those that know not how to live except as down goers  for they
are the over goers 

i love the great despisers  because they are the great adorers  and
arrows of longing for the other shore 

i love those who do not first seek a reason beyond the stars for going
down and being sacrifices  but sacrifice themselves to the earth  that
the earth of the superman may hereafter arrive 

i love him who liveth in order to know  and seeketh to know in
order that the superman may hereafter live  thus seeketh he his own
down going 

i love him who laboureth and inventeth  that he may build the house for
the superman  and prepare for him earth  animal  and plant  for thus
seeketh he his own down going 

i love him who loveth his virtue  for virtue is the will to down going 
and an arrow of longing 

i love him who reserveth no share of spirit for himself  but wanteth to
be wholly the spirit of his virtue  thus walketh he as spirit over the
bridge 

i love him who maketh his virtue his inclination and destiny  thus  for
the sake of his virtue  he is willing to live on  or live no more 

i love him who desireth not too many virtues  one virtue is more of a
virtue than two  because it is more of a knot for one s destiny to cling
to 

i love him whose soul is lavish  who wanteth no thanks and doth not give
back  for he always bestoweth  and desireth not to keep for himself 

i love him who is ashamed when the dice fall in his favour  and who then
asketh   am i a dishonest player    for he is willing to succumb 

i love him who scattereth golden words in advance of his deeds  and
always doeth more than he promiseth  for he seeketh his own down going 

i love him who justifieth the future ones  and redeemeth the past ones 
for he is willing to succumb through the present ones 

i love him who chasteneth his god  because he loveth his god  for he
must succumb through the wrath of his god 

i love him whose soul is deep even in the wounding  and may succumb
through a small matter  thus goeth he willingly over the bridge 

i love him whose soul is so overfull that he forgetteth himself  and all
things are in him  thus all things become his down going 

i love him who is of a free spirit and a free heart  thus is his
head only the bowels of his heart  his heart  however  causeth his
down going 

i love all who are like heavy drops falling one by one out of the dark
cloud that lowereth over man  they herald the coming of the lightning 
and succumb as heralds 

lo  i am a herald of the lightning  and a heavy drop out of the cloud 
the lightning  however  is the superman   

5 

when zarathustra had spoken these words  he again looked at the people 
and was silent   there they stand   said he to his heart   there they
laugh  they understand me not  i am not the mouth for these ears 

must one first batter their ears  that they may learn to hear with their
eyes  must one clatter like kettledrums and penitential preachers  or do
they only believe the stammerer 

they have something whereof they are proud  what do they call it  that
which maketh them proud  culture  they call it  it distinguisheth them
from the goatherds 

they dislike  therefore  to hear of  contempt  of themselves  so i will
appeal to their pride 

i will speak unto them of the most contemptible thing  that  however  is
the last man  

and thus spake zarathustra unto the people 

it is time for man to fix his goal  it is time for man to plant the germ
of his highest hope 

still is his soil rich enough for it  but that soil will one day be
poor and exhausted  and no lofty tree will any longer be able to grow
thereon 

alas  there cometh the time when man will no longer launch the arrow of
his longing beyond man  and the string of his bow will have unlearned to
whizz 

i tell you  one must still have chaos in one  to give birth to a dancing
star  i tell you  ye have still chaos in you 

alas  there cometh the time when man will no longer give birth to any
star  alas  there cometh the time of the most despicable man  who can no
longer despise himself 

lo  i show you the last man 

 what is love  what is creation  what is longing  what is a star    so
asketh the last man and blinketh 

the earth hath then become small  and on it there hoppeth the last man
who maketh everything small  his species is ineradicable like that of
the ground flea  the last man liveth longest 

 we have discovered happiness   say the last men  and blink thereby 

they have left the regions where it is hard to live  for they need
warmth  one still loveth one s neighbour and rubbeth against him  for
one needeth warmth 

turning ill and being distrustful  they consider sinful  they walk
warily  he is a fool who still stumbleth over stones or men 

a little poison now and then  that maketh pleasant dreams  and much
poison at last for a pleasant death 

one still worketh  for work is a pastime  but one is careful lest the
pastime should hurt one 

one no longer becometh poor or rich  both are too burdensome  who still
wanteth to rule  who still wanteth to obey  both are too burdensome 

no shepherd  and one herd  every one wanteth the same  every one is
equal  he who hath other sentiments goeth voluntarily into the madhouse 

 formerly all the world was insane    say the subtlest of them  and
blink thereby 

they are clever and know all that hath happened  so there is
no end to their raillery  people still fall out  but are soon
reconciled  otherwise it spoileth their stomachs 

they have their little pleasures for the day  and their little pleasures
for the night  but they have a regard for health 

 we have discovered happiness    say the last men  and blink thereby   

and here ended the first discourse of zarathustra  which is also
called  the prologue   for at this point the shouting and mirth of the
multitude interrupted him   give us this last man  o zarathustra    they
called out   make us into these last men  then will we make thee a
present of the superman   and all the people exulted and smacked their
lips  zarathustra  however  turned sad  and said to his heart 

 they understand me not  i am not the mouth for these ears 

too long  perhaps  have i lived in the mountains  too much have i
hearkened unto the brooks and trees  now do i speak unto them as unto
the goatherds 

calm is my soul  and clear  like the mountains in the morning  but they
think me cold  and a mocker with terrible jests 

and now do they look at me and laugh  and while they laugh they hate me
too  there is ice in their laughter

then  however  something happened which made every mouth mute and every
eye fixed  in the meantime  of course  the rope dancer had commenced his
performance  he had come out at a little door  and was going along the
rope which was stretched between two towers  so that it hung above the
market place and the people  when he was just midway across  the little
door opened once more  and a gaudily dressed fellow like a buffoon
sprang out  and went rapidly after the first one   go on  halt foot  
 cried his frightful voice   go on  lazy bones  interloper 
sallow face   lest i tickle thee with my heel  what dost thou here
between the towers  in the tower is the place for thee  thou shouldst be
locked up  to one better than thyself thou blockest the way    and with
every word he came nearer and nearer the first one  when  however  he
was but a step behind  there happened the frightful thing which made
every mouth mute and every eye fixed  he uttered a yell like a devil 
and jumped over the other who was in his way  the latter  however  when
he thus saw his rival triumph  lost at the same time his head and his
footing on the rope  he threw his pole away  and shot downwards faster
than it  like an eddy of arms and legs  into the depth  the market place
and the people were like the sea when the storm cometh on  they all flew
apart and in disorder  especially where the body was about to fall 

zarathustra  however  remained standing  and just beside him fell the
body  badly injured and disfigured  but not yet dead  after a while
consciousness returned to the shattered man  and he saw zarathustra
kneeling beside him   what art thou doing there   said he at last   i
knew long ago that the devil would trip me up  now he draggeth me to
hell  wilt thou prevent him  

 on mine honour  my friend   answered zarathustra   there is nothing of
all that whereof thou speakest  there is no devil and no hell  thy soul
will be dead even sooner than thy body  fear  therefore  nothing any
more  

the man looked up distrustfully   if thou speakest the truth   said he 
 i lose nothing when i lose my life  i am not much more than an animal
which hath been taught to dance by blows and scanty fare  

 not at all   said zarathustra   thou hast made danger thy calling 
therein there is nothing contemptible  now thou perishest by thy
calling  therefore will i bury thee with mine own hands  

when zarathustra had said this the dying one did not reply further  but
he moved his hand as if he sought the hand of zarathustra in gratitude 

7 

meanwhile the evening came on  and the market place veiled itself in
gloom  then the people dispersed  for even curiosity and terror become
fatigued  zarathustra  however  still sat beside the dead man on the
ground  absorbed in thought  so he forgot the time  but at last it
became night  and a cold wind blew upon the lonely one  then arose
zarathustra and said to his heart 

verily  a fine catch of fish hath zarathustra made to day  it is not a
man he hath caught  but a corpse 

sombre is human life  and as yet without meaning  a buffoon may be
fateful to it 

i want to teach men the sense of their existence  which is the superman 
the lightning out of the dark cloud  man 

but still am i far from them  and my sense speaketh not unto their
sense  to men i am still something between a fool and a corpse 

gloomy is the night  gloomy are the ways of zarathustra  come  thou cold
and stiff companion  i carry thee to the place where i shall bury thee
with mine own hands 

8 

when zarathustra had said this to his heart  he put the corpse upon his
shoulders and set out on his way  yet had he not gone a hundred steps 
when there stole a man up to him and whispered in his ear  and lo 
he that spake was the buffoon from the tower   leave this town  o
zarathustra   said he   there are too many here who hate thee  the
good and just hate thee  and call thee their enemy and despiser  the
believers in the orthodox belief hate thee  and call thee a danger to
the multitude  it was thy good fortune to be laughed at  and verily thou
spakest like a buffoon  it was thy good fortune to associate with the
dead dog  by so humiliating thyself thou hast saved thy life to day 
depart  however  from this town   or tomorrow i shall jump over thee 
a living man over a dead one   and when he had said this  the buffoon
vanished  zarathustra  however  went on through the dark streets 

at the gate of the town the grave diggers met him  they shone their
torch on his face  and  recognising zarathustra  they sorely derided
him   zarathustra is carrying away the dead dog  a fine thing that
zarathustra hath turned a grave digger  for our hands are too cleanly
for that roast  will zarathustra steal the bite from the devil  well
then  good luck to the repast  if only the devil is not a better thief
than zarathustra   he will steal them both  he will eat them both   and
they laughed among themselves  and put their heads together 

zarathustra made no answer thereto  but went on his way  when he had
gone on for two hours  past forests and swamps  he had heard too much of
the hungry howling of the wolves  and he himself became a hungry  so he
halted at a lonely house in which a light was burning 

 hunger attacketh me   said zarathustra   like a robber  among forests
and swamps my hunger attacketh me  and late in the night 

 strange humours hath my hunger  often it cometh to me only after a
repast  and all day it hath failed to come  where hath it been  

and thereupon zarathustra knocked at the door of the house  an old man
appeared  who carried a light  and asked   who cometh unto me and my bad
sleep  

 a living man and a dead one   said zarathustra   give me something to
eat and drink  i forgot it during the day  he that feedeth the hungry
refresheth his own soul  saith wisdom  

the old man withdrew  but came back immediately and offered zarathustra
bread and wine   a bad country for the hungry   said he   that is why
i live here  animal and man come unto me  the anchorite  but bid thy
companion eat and drink also  he is wearier than thou   zarathustra
answered   my companion is dead  i shall hardly be able to persuade him
to eat    that doth not concern me   said the old man sullenly   he
that knocketh at my door must take what i offer him  eat  and fare ye
well    

thereafter zarathustra again went on for two hours  trusting to the path
and the light of the stars  for he was an experienced night walker  and
liked to look into the face of all that slept  when the morning dawned 
however  zarathustra found himself in a thick forest  and no path was
any longer visible  he then put the dead man in a hollow tree at his
head  for he wanted to protect him from the wolves  and laid himself
down on the ground and moss  and immediately he fell asleep  tired in
body  but with a tranquil soul 

9 

long slept zarathustra  and not only the rosy dawn passed over his head 
but also the morning  at last  however  his eyes opened  and amazedly he
gazed into the forest and the stillness  amazedly he gazed into himself 
then he arose quickly  like a seafarer who all at once seeth the land 
and he shouted for joy  for he saw a new truth  and he spake thus to his
heart 

a light hath dawned upon me  i need companions  living ones  not dead
companions and corpses  which i carry with me where i will 

but i need living companions  who will follow me because they want to
follow themselves  and to the place where i will 

a light hath dawned upon me  not to the people is zarathustra to speak 
but to companions  zarathustra shall not be the herd s herdsman and
hound 

to allure many from the herd  for that purpose have i come  the people
and the herd must be angry with me  a robber shall zarathustra be called
by the herdsmen 

herdsmen  i say  but they call themselves the good and just  herdsmen  i
say  but they call themselves the believers in the orthodox belief 

behold the good and just  whom do they hate most  him who breaketh up
their tables of values  the breaker  the lawbreaker   he  however  is
the creator 

behold the believers of all beliefs  whom do they hate most  him who
breaketh up their tables of values  the breaker  the law breaker  he 
however  is the creator 

companions  the creator seeketh  not corpses  and not herds or believers
either  fellow creators the creator seeketh  those who grave new values
on new tables 

companions  the creator seeketh  and fellow reapers  for everything is
ripe for the harvest with him  but he lacketh the hundred sickles  so he
plucketh the ears of corn and is vexed 

companions  the creator seeketh  and such as know how to whet their
sickles  destroyers  will they be called  and despisers of good and
evil  but they are the reapers and rejoicers 

fellow creators  zarathustra seeketh  fellow reapers and
fellow rejoicers  zarathustra seeketh  what hath he to do with herds and
herdsmen and corpses 

and thou  my first companion  rest in peace  well have i buried thee in
thy hollow tree  well have i hid thee from the wolves 

but i part from thee  the time hath arrived   twixt rosy dawn and rosy
dawn there came unto me a new truth 

i am not to be a herdsman  i am not to be a grave digger  not any more
will i discourse unto the people  for the last time have i spoken unto
the dead 

with the creators  the reapers  and the rejoicers will i associate  the
rainbow will i show them  and all the stairs to the superman 

to the lone dwellers will i sing my song  and to the twain dwellers 
and unto him who hath still ears for the unheard  will i make the heart
heavy with my happiness 

i make for my goal  i follow my course  over the loitering and tardy
will i leap  thus let my on going be their down going 

10 

this had zarathustra said to his heart when the sun stood at noon tide 
then he looked inquiringly aloft   for he heard above him the sharp call
of a bird  and behold  an eagle swept through the air in wide circles 
and on it hung a serpent  not like a prey  but like a friend  for it
kept itself coiled round the eagle s neck 

 they are mine animals   said zarathustra  and rejoiced in his heart 

 the proudest animal under the sun  and the wisest animal under the
sun   they have come out to reconnoitre 

they want to know whether zarathustra still liveth  verily  do i still
live 

more dangerous have i found it among men than among animals  in
dangerous paths goeth zarathustra  let mine animals lead me 

when zarathustra had said this  he remembered the words of the saint in
the forest  then he sighed and spake thus to his heart 

 would that i were wiser  would that i were wise from the very heart 
like my serpent 

but i am asking the impossible  therefore do i ask my pride to go always
with my wisdom 

and if my wisdom should some day forsake me   alas  it loveth to fly
away   may my pride then fly with my folly  

thus began zarathustra s down going 




zarathustra s discourses 




i  the three metamorphoses 

three metamorphoses of the spirit do i designate to you  how the spirit
becometh a camel  the camel a lion  and the lion at last a child 

many heavy things are there for the spirit  the strong load bearing
spirit in which reverence dwelleth  for the heavy and the heaviest
longeth its strength 

what is heavy  so asketh the load bearing spirit  then kneeleth it down
like the camel  and wanteth to be well laden 

what is the heaviest thing  ye heroes  asketh the load bearing spirit 
that i may take it upon me and rejoice in my strength 

is it not this  to humiliate oneself in order to mortify one s pride  to
exhibit one s folly in order to mock at one s wisdom 

or is it this  to desert our cause when it celebrateth its triumph  to
ascend high mountains to tempt the tempter 

or is it this  to feed on the acorns and grass of knowledge  and for the
sake of truth to suffer hunger of soul 

or is it this  to be sick and dismiss comforters  and make friends of
the deaf  who never hear thy requests 

or is it this  to go into foul water when it is the water of truth  and
not disclaim cold frogs and hot toads 

or is it this  to love those who despise us  and give one s hand to the
phantom when it is going to frighten us 

all these heaviest things the load bearing spirit taketh upon itself 
and like the camel  which  when laden  hasteneth into the wilderness  so
hasteneth the spirit into its wilderness 

but in the loneliest wilderness happeneth the second metamorphosis  here
the spirit becometh a lion  freedom will it capture  and lordship in its
own wilderness 

its last lord it here seeketh  hostile will it be to him  and to its
last god  for victory will it struggle with the great dragon 

what is the great dragon which the spirit is no longer inclined to call
lord and god   thou shalt   is the great dragon called  but the spirit
of the lion saith   i will  

 thou shalt   lieth in its path  sparkling with gold  a scale covered
beast  and on every scale glittereth golden   thou shalt  

the values of a thousand years glitter on those scales  and
thus speaketh the mightiest of all dragons   all the values of
things  glitter on me 

all values have already been created  and all created values  do i
represent  verily  there shall be no  i will  any more  thus speaketh
the dragon 

my brethren  wherefore is there need of the lion in the spirit  why
sufficeth not the beast of burden  which renounceth and is reverent 

to create new values  that  even the lion cannot yet accomplish  but to
create itself freedom for new creating  that can the might of the lion
do 

to create itself freedom  and give a holy nay even unto duty  for that 
my brethren  there is need of the lion 

to assume the right to new values  that is the most formidable
assumption for a load bearing and reverent spirit  verily  unto such a
spirit it is preying  and the work of a beast of prey 

as its holiest  it once loved  thou shalt   now is it forced to find
illusion and arbitrariness even in the holiest things  that it may
capture freedom from its love  the lion is needed for this capture 

but tell me  my brethren  what the child can do  which even the lion
could not do  why hath the preying lion still to become a child 

innocence is the child  and forgetfulness  a new beginning  a game  a
self rolling wheel  a first movement  a holy yea 

aye  for the game of creating  my brethren  there is needed a holy yea
unto life  its own will  willeth now the spirit  his own world winneth
the world s outcast 

three metamorphoses of the spirit have i designated to you  how the
spirit became a camel  the camel a lion  and the lion at last a child   

thus spake zarathustra  and at that time he abode in the town which is
called the pied cow 




ii  the academic chairs of virtue 

people commended unto zarathustra a wise man  as one who could discourse
well about sleep and virtue  greatly was he honoured and rewarded for
it  and all the youths sat before his chair  to him went zarathustra 
and sat among the youths before his chair  and thus spake the wise man 

respect and modesty in presence of sleep  that is the first thing  and
to go out of the way of all who sleep badly and keep awake at night 

modest is even the thief in presence of sleep  he always stealeth softly
through the night  immodest  however  is the night watchman  immodestly
he carrieth his horn 

no small art is it to sleep  it is necessary for that purpose to keep
awake all day 

ten times a day must thou overcome thyself  that causeth wholesome
weariness  and is poppy to the soul 

ten times must thou reconcile again with thyself  for overcoming is
bitterness  and badly sleep the unreconciled 

ten truths must thou find during the day  otherwise wilt thou seek truth
during the night  and thy soul will have been hungry 

ten times must thou laugh during the day  and be cheerful  otherwise thy
stomach  the father of affliction  will disturb thee in the night 

few people know it  but one must have all the virtues in order to sleep
well  shall i bear false witness  shall i commit adultery 

shall i covet my neighbour s maidservant  all that would ill accord with
good sleep 

and even if one have all the virtues  there is still one thing needful 
to send the virtues themselves to sleep at the right time 

that they may not quarrel with one another  the good females  and about
thee  thou unhappy one 

peace with god and thy neighbour  so desireth good sleep  and peace also
with thy neighbour s devil  otherwise it will haunt thee in the night 

honour to the government  and obedience  and also to the crooked
government  so desireth good sleep  how can i help it  if power like to
walk on crooked legs 

he who leadeth his sheep to the greenest pasture  shall always be for me
the best shepherd  so doth it accord with good sleep 

many honours i want not  nor great treasures  they excite the spleen 
but it is bad sleeping without a good name and a little treasure 

a small company is more welcome to me than a bad one  but they must come
and go at the right time  so doth it accord with good sleep 

well  also  do the poor in spirit please me  they promote sleep  blessed
are they  especially if one always give in to them 

thus passeth the day unto the virtuous  when night cometh  then take i
good care not to summon sleep  it disliketh to be summoned  sleep  the
lord of the virtues 

but i think of what i have done and thought during the day  thus
ruminating  patient as a cow  i ask myself  what were thy ten
overcomings 

and what were the ten reconciliations  and the ten truths  and the ten
laughters with which my heart enjoyed itself 

thus pondering  and cradled by forty thoughts  it overtaketh me all at
once  sleep  the unsummoned  the lord of the virtues 

sleep tappeth on mine eye  and it turneth heavy  sleep toucheth my
mouth  and it remaineth open 

verily  on soft soles doth it come to me  the dearest of thieves  and
stealeth from me my thoughts  stupid do i then stand  like this academic
chair 

but not much longer do i then stand  i already lie   

when zarathustra heard the wise man thus speak  he laughed in his heart 
for thereby had a light dawned upon him  and thus spake he to his heart 

a fool seemeth this wise man with his forty thoughts  but i believe he
knoweth well how to sleep 

happy even is he who liveth near this wise man  such sleep is
contagious  even through a thick wall it is contagious 

a magic resideth even in his academic chair  and not in vain did the
youths sit before the preacher of virtue 

his wisdom is to keep awake in order to sleep well  and verily  if
life had no sense  and had i to choose nonsense  this would be the
desirablest nonsense for me also 

now know i well what people sought formerly above all else when they
sought teachers of virtue  good sleep they sought for themselves  and
poppy head virtues to promote it 

to all those belauded sages of the academic chairs  wisdom was sleep
without dreams  they knew no higher significance of life 

even at present  to be sure  there are some like this preacher of
virtue  and not always so honourable  but their time is past  and not
much longer do they stand  there they already lie 

blessed are those drowsy ones  for they shall soon nod to sleep   

thus spake zarathustra 




iii  backworldsmen 

once on a time  zarathustra also cast his fancy beyond man  like all
backworldsmen  the work of a suffering and tortured god  did the world
then seem to me 

the dream  and diction  of a god  did the world then seem to me 
coloured vapours before the eyes of a divinely dissatisfied one 

good and evil  and joy and woe  and i and thou  coloured vapours did
they seem to me before creative eyes  the creator wished to look away
from himself   thereupon he created the world 

intoxicating joy is it for the sufferer to look away from his suffering
and forget himself  intoxicating joy and self forgetting  did the world
once seem to me 

this world  the eternally imperfect  an eternal contradiction s image
and imperfect image  an intoxicating joy to its imperfect creator   thus
did the world once seem to me 

thus  once on a time  did i also cast my fancy beyond man  like all
backworldsmen  beyond man  forsooth 

ah  ye brethren  that god whom i created was human work and human
madness  like all the gods 

a man was he  and only a poor fragment of a man and ego  out of mine own
ashes and glow it came unto me  that phantom  and verily  it came not
unto me from the beyond 

what happened  my brethren  i surpassed myself  the suffering one  i
carried mine own ashes to the mountain  a brighter flame i contrived for
myself  and lo  thereupon the phantom withdrew from me 

to me the convalescent would it now be suffering and torment to believe
in such phantoms  suffering would it now be to me  and humiliation  thus
speak i to backworldsmen 

suffering was it  and impotence  that created all backworlds  and
the short madness of happiness  which only the greatest sufferer
experienceth 

weariness  which seeketh to get to the ultimate with one leap  with
a death leap  a poor ignorant weariness  unwilling even to will any
longer  that created all gods and backworlds 

believe me  my brethren  it was the body which despaired of the body  it
groped with the fingers of the infatuated spirit at the ultimate walls 

believe me  my brethren  it was the body which despaired of the
earth  it heard the bowels of existence speaking unto it 

and then it sought to get through the ultimate walls with its head  and
not with its head only  into  the other world  

but that  other world  is well concealed from man  that dehumanised 
inhuman world  which is a celestial naught  and the bowels of existence
do not speak unto man  except as man 

verily  it is difficult to prove all being  and hard to make it speak 
tell me  ye brethren  is not the strangest of all things best proved 

yea  this ego  with its contradiction and perplexity  speaketh most
uprightly of its being  this creating  willing  evaluing ego  which is
the measure and value of things 

and this most upright existence  the ego  it speaketh of the body  and
still implieth the body  even when it museth and raveth and fluttereth
with broken wings 

always more uprightly learneth it to speak  the ego  and the more it
learneth  the more doth it find titles and honours for the body and the
earth 

a new pride taught me mine ego  and that teach i unto men  no longer
to thrust one s head into the sand of celestial things  but to carry it
freely  a terrestrial head  which giveth meaning to the earth 

a new will teach i unto men  to choose that path which man hath followed
blindly  and to approve of it  and no longer to slink aside from it 
like the sick and perishing 

the sick and perishing  it was they who despised the body and the earth 
and invented the heavenly world  and the redeeming blood drops  but even
those sweet and sad poisons they borrowed from the body and the earth 

from their misery they sought escape  and the stars were too remote for
them  then they sighed   o that there were heavenly paths by which to
steal into another existence and into happiness   then they contrived
for themselves their by paths and bloody draughts 

beyond the sphere of their body and this earth they now fancied
themselves transported  these ungrateful ones  but to what did they owe
the convulsion and rapture of their transport  to their body and this
earth 

gentle is zarathustra to the sickly  verily  he is not indignant
at their modes of consolation and ingratitude  may they become
convalescents and overcomers  and create higher bodies for themselves 

neither is zarathustra indignant at a convalescent who looketh tenderly
on his delusions  and at midnight stealeth round the grave of his god 
but sickness and a sick frame remain even in his tears 

many sickly ones have there always been among those who muse  and
languish for god  violently they hate the discerning ones  and the
latest of virtues  which is uprightness 

backward they always gaze toward dark ages  then  indeed  were delusion
and faith something different  raving of the reason was likeness to god 
and doubt was sin 

too well do i know those godlike ones  they insist on being believed in 
and that doubt is sin  too well  also  do i know what they themselves
most believe in 

verily  not in backworlds and redeeming blood drops  but in the body
do they also believe most  and their own body is for them the
thing in itself 

but it is a sickly thing to them  and gladly would they get out of their
skin  therefore hearken they to the preachers of death  and themselves
preach backworlds 

hearken rather  my brethren  to the voice of the healthy body  it is a
more upright and pure voice 

more uprightly and purely speaketh the healthy body  perfect and
square built  and it speaketh of the meaning of the earth   

thus spake zarathustra 




iv  the despisers of the body 

to the despisers of the body will i speak my word  i wish them neither
to learn afresh  nor teach anew  but only to bid farewell to their own
bodies   and thus be dumb 

 body am i  and soul   so saith the child  and why should one not speak
like children 

but the awakened one  the knowing one  saith   body am i entirely  and
nothing more  and soul is only the name of something in the body  

the body is a big sagacity  a plurality with one sense  a war and a
peace  a flock and a shepherd 

an instrument of thy body is also thy little sagacity  my brother  which
thou callest  spirit   a little instrument and plaything of thy big
sagacity 

 ego   sayest thou  and art proud of that word  but the greater
thing  in which thou art unwilling to believe  is thy body with its big
sagacity  it saith not  ego   but doeth it 

what the sense feeleth  what the spirit discerneth  hath never its end
in itself  but sense and spirit would fain persuade thee that they are
the end of all things  so vain are they 

instruments and playthings are sense and spirit  behind them there
is still the self  the self seeketh with the eyes of the senses  it
hearkeneth also with the ears of the spirit 

ever hearkeneth the self  and seeketh  it compareth  mastereth 
conquereth  and destroyeth  it ruleth  and is also the ego s ruler 

behind thy thoughts and feelings  my brother  there is a mighty lord 
an unknown sage  it is called self  it dwelleth in thy body  it is thy
body 

there is more sagacity in thy body than in thy best wisdom  and who then
knoweth why thy body requireth just thy best wisdom 

thy self laugheth at thine ego  and its proud prancings   what are these
prancings and flights of thought unto me   it saith to itself   a by way
to my purpose  i am the leading string of the ego  and the prompter of
its notions  

the self saith unto the ego   feel pain   and thereupon it suffereth 
and thinketh how it may put an end thereto  and for that very purpose it
is meant to think 

the self saith unto the ego   feel pleasure   thereupon it rejoiceth 
and thinketh how it may ofttimes rejoice  and for that very purpose it
is meant to think 

to the despisers of the body will i speak a word  that they despise is
caused by their esteem  what is it that created esteeming and despising
and worth and will 

the creating self created for itself esteeming and despising  it created
for itself joy and woe  the creating body created for itself spirit  as
a hand to its will 

even in your folly and despising ye each serve your self  ye despisers
of the body  i tell you  your very self wanteth to die  and turneth away
from life 

no longer can your self do that which it desireth most   create beyond
itself  that is what it desireth most  that is all its fervour 

but it is now too late to do so   so your self wisheth to succumb  ye
despisers of the body 

to succumb  so wisheth your self  and therefore have ye become despisers
of the body  for ye can no longer create beyond yourselves 

and therefore are ye now angry with life and with the earth  and
unconscious envy is in the sidelong look of your contempt 

i go not your way  ye despisers of the body  ye are no bridges for me to
the superman   

thus spake zarathustra 




v  joys and passions 

my brother  when thou hast a virtue  and it is thine own virtue  thou
hast it in common with no one 

to be sure  thou wouldst call it by name and caress it  thou wouldst
pull its ears and amuse thyself with it 

and lo  then hast thou its name in common with the people  and hast
become one of the people and the herd with thy virtue 

better for thee to say   ineffable is it  and nameless  that which is
pain and sweetness to my soul  and also the hunger of my bowels  

let thy virtue be too high for the familiarity of names  and if thou
must speak of it  be not ashamed to stammer about it 

thus speak and stammer   that is my good  that do i love  thus doth it
please me entirely  thus only do  i  desire the good 

not as the law of a god do i desire it  not as a human law or a human
need do i desire it  it is not to be a guide post for me to superearths
and paradises 

an earthly virtue is it which i love  little prudence is therein  and
the least everyday wisdom 

but that bird built its nest beside me  therefore  i love and cherish
it  now sitteth it beside me on its golden eggs  

thus shouldst thou stammer  and praise thy virtue 

once hadst thou passions and calledst them evil  but now hast thou only
thy virtues  they grew out of thy passions 

thou implantedst thy highest aim into the heart of those passions  then
became they thy virtues and joys 

and though thou wert of the race of the hot tempered  or of the
voluptuous  or of the fanatical  or the vindictive 

all thy passions in the end became virtues  and all thy devils angels 

once hadst thou wild dogs in thy cellar  but they changed at last into
birds and charming songstresses 

out of thy poisons brewedst thou balsam for thyself  thy cow 
affliction  milkedst thou  now drinketh thou the sweet milk of her
udder 

and nothing evil groweth in thee any longer  unless it be the evil that
groweth out of the conflict of thy virtues 

my brother  if thou be fortunate  then wilt thou have one virtue and no
more  thus goest thou easier over the bridge 

illustrious is it to have many virtues  but a hard lot  and many a one
hath gone into the wilderness and killed himself  because he was weary
of being the battle and battlefield of virtues 

my brother  are war and battle evil  necessary  however  is the evil 
necessary are the envy and the distrust and the back biting among the
virtues 

lo  how each of thy virtues is covetous of the highest place  it wanteth
thy whole spirit to be its herald  it wanteth thy whole power  in wrath 
hatred  and love 

jealous is every virtue of the others  and a dreadful thing is jealousy 
even virtues may succumb by jealousy 

he whom the flame of jealousy encompasseth  turneth at last  like the
scorpion  the poisoned sting against himself 

ah  my brother  hast thou never seen a virtue backbite and stab itself 

man is something that hath to be surpassed  and therefore shalt thou
love thy virtues   for thou wilt succumb by them   

thus spake zarathustra 




vi  the pale criminal 

ye do not mean to slay  ye judges and sacrificers  until the animal hath
bowed its head  lo  the pale criminal hath bowed his head  out of his
eye speaketh the great contempt 

 mine ego is something which is to be surpassed  mine ego is to me the
great contempt of man   so speaketh it out of that eye 

when he judged himself  that was his supreme moment  let not the exalted
one relapse again into his low estate 

there is no salvation for him who thus suffereth from himself  unless it
be speedy death 

your slaying  ye judges  shall be pity  and not revenge  and in that ye
slay  see to it that ye yourselves justify life 

it is not enough that ye should reconcile with him whom ye slay  let
your sorrow be love to the superman  thus will ye justify your own
survival 

 enemy  shall ye say but not  villain    invalid  shall ye say but not
 wretch    fool  shall ye say but not  sinner  

and thou  red judge  if thou would say audibly all thou hast done in
thought  then would every one cry   away with the nastiness and the
virulent reptile  

but one thing is the thought  another thing is the deed  and another
thing is the idea of the deed  the wheel of causality doth not roll
between them 

an idea made this pale man pale  adequate was he for his deed when he
did it  but the idea of it  he could not endure when it was done 

evermore did he now see himself as the doer of one deed  madness  i call
this  the exception reversed itself to the rule in him 

the streak of chalk bewitcheth the hen  the stroke he struck bewitched
his weak reason  madness after the deed  i call this 

hearken  ye judges  there is another madness besides  and it is before
the deed  ah  ye have not gone deep enough into this soul 

thus speaketh the red judge   why did this criminal commit murder  he
meant to rob   i tell you  however  that his soul wanted blood  not
booty  he thirsted for the happiness of the knife 

but his weak reason understood not this madness  and it persuaded him 
 what matter about blood   it said   wishest thou not  at least  to make
booty thereby  or take revenge  

and he hearkened unto his weak reason  like lead lay its words upon
him  thereupon he robbed when he murdered  he did not mean to be
ashamed of his madness 

and now once more lieth the lead of his guilt upon him  and once more is
his weak reason so benumbed  so paralysed  and so dull 

could he only shake his head  then would his burden roll off  but who
shaketh that head 

what is this man  a mass of diseases that reach out into the world
through the spirit  there they want to get their prey 

what is this man  a coil of wild serpents that are seldom at peace among
themselves  so they go forth apart and seek prey in the world 

look at that poor body  what it suffered and craved  the poor soul
interpreted to itself  it interpreted it as murderous desire  and
eagerness for the happiness of the knife 

him who now turneth sick  the evil overtaketh which is now the evil  he
seeketh to cause pain with that which causeth him pain  but there have
been other ages  and another evil and good 

once was doubt evil  and the will to self  then the invalid became a
heretic or sorcerer  as heretic or sorcerer he suffered  and sought to
cause suffering 

but this will not enter your ears  it hurteth your good people  ye tell
me  but what doth it matter to me about your good people 

many things in your good people cause me disgust  and verily  not their
evil  i would that they had a madness by which they succumbed  like this
pale criminal 

verily  i would that their madness were called truth  or fidelity 
or justice  but they have their virtue in order to live long  and in
wretched self complacency 

i am a railing alongside the torrent  whoever is able to grasp me may
grasp me  your crutch  however  i am not   

thus spake zarathustra 




vii  reading and writing 

of all that is written  i love only what a person hath written with his
blood  write with blood  and thou wilt find that blood is spirit 

it is no easy task to understand unfamiliar blood  i hate the reading
idlers 

he who knoweth the reader  doeth nothing more for the reader  another
century of readers  and spirit itself will stink 

every one being allowed to learn to read  ruineth in the long run not
only writing but also thinking 

once spirit was god  then it became man  and now it even becometh
populace 

he that writeth in blood and proverbs doth not want to be read  but
learnt by heart 

in the mountains the shortest way is from peak to peak  but for that
route thou must have long legs  proverbs should be peaks  and those
spoken to should be big and tall 

the atmosphere rare and pure  danger near and the spirit full of a
joyful wickedness  thus are things well matched 

i want to have goblins about me  for i am courageous  the courage which
scareth away ghosts  createth for itself goblins  it wanteth to laugh 

i no longer feel in common with you  the very cloud which i see
beneath me  the blackness and heaviness at which i laugh  that is your
thunder cloud 

ye look aloft when ye long for exaltation  and i look downward because i
am exalted 

who among you can at the same time laugh and be exalted 

he who climbeth on the highest mountains  laugheth at all tragic plays
and tragic realities 

courageous  unconcerned  scornful  coercive  so wisdom wisheth us  she
is a woman  and ever loveth only a warrior 

ye tell me   life is hard to bear   but for what purpose should ye have
your pride in the morning and your resignation in the evening 

life is hard to bear  but do not affect to be so delicate  we are all of
us fine sumpter asses and assesses 

what have we in common with the rose bud  which trembleth because a drop
of dew hath formed upon it 

it is true we love life  not because we are wont to live  but because we
are wont to love 

there is always some madness in love  but there is always  also  some
method in madness 

and to me also  who appreciate life  the butterflies  and soap bubbles 
and whatever is like them amongst us  seem most to enjoy happiness 

to see these light  foolish  pretty  lively little sprites flit
about  that moveth zarathustra to tears and songs 

i should only believe in a god that would know how to dance 

and when i saw my devil  i found him serious  thorough  profound 
solemn  he was the spirit of gravity  through him all things fall 

not by wrath  but by laughter  do we slay  come  let us slay the spirit
of gravity 

i learned to walk  since then have i let myself run  i learned to fly 
since then i do not need pushing in order to move from a spot 

now am i light  now do i fly  now do i see myself under myself  now
there danceth a god in me   

thus spake zarathustra 




viii  the tree on the hill 

zarathustra s eye had perceived that a certain youth avoided him  and as
he walked alone one evening over the hills surrounding the town called
 the pied cow   behold  there found he the youth sitting leaning against
a tree  and gazing with wearied look into the valley  zarathustra
thereupon laid hold of the tree beside which the youth sat  and spake
thus 

 if i wished to shake this tree with my hands  i should not be able to
do so 

but the wind  which we see not  troubleth and bendeth it as it listeth 
we are sorest bent and troubled by invisible hands  

thereupon the youth arose disconcerted  and said   i hear zarathustra 
and just now was i thinking of him   zarathustra answered 

 why art thou frightened on that account   but it is the same with man
as with the tree 

the more he seeketh to rise into the height and light  the more
vigorously do his roots struggle earthward  downward  into the dark and
deep  into the evil  

 yea  into the evil   cried the youth   how is it possible that thou
hast discovered my soul  

zarathustra smiled  and said   many a soul one will never discover 
unless one first invent it  

 yea  into the evil   cried the youth once more 

 thou saidst the truth  zarathustra  i trust myself no longer since i
sought to rise into the height  and nobody trusteth me any longer  how
doth that happen 

i change too quickly  my to day refuteth my yesterday  i often overleap
the steps when i clamber  for so doing  none of the steps pardons me 

when aloft  i find myself always alone  no one speaketh unto me  the
frost of solitude maketh me tremble  what do i seek on the height 

my contempt and my longing increase together  the higher i clamber  the
more do i despise him who clambereth  what doth he seek on the height 

how ashamed i am of my clambering and stumbling  how i mock at my
violent panting  how i hate him who flieth  how tired i am on the
height  

here the youth was silent  and zarathustra contemplated the tree beside
which they stood  and spake thus 

 this tree standeth lonely here on the hills  it hath grown up high
above man and beast 

and if it wanted to speak  it would have none who could understand it 
so high hath it grown 

now it waiteth and waiteth   for what doth it wait  it dwelleth too
close to the seat of the clouds  it waiteth perhaps for the first
lightning  

when zarathustra had said this  the youth called out with violent
gestures   yea  zarathustra  thou speakest the truth  my destruction
i longed for  when i desired to be on the height  and thou art the
lightning for which i waited  lo  what have i been since thou hast
appeared amongst us  it is mine envy of thee that hath destroyed
me    thus spake the youth  and wept bitterly  zarathustra  however  put
his arm about him  and led the youth away with him 

and when they had walked a while together  zarathustra began to speak
thus 

it rendeth my heart  better than thy words express it  thine eyes tell
me all thy danger 

as yet thou art not free  thou still seekest freedom  too unslept hath
thy seeking made thee  and too wakeful 

on the open height wouldst thou be  for the stars thirsteth thy soul 
but thy bad impulses also thirst for freedom 

thy wild dogs want liberty  they bark for joy in their cellar when thy
spirit endeavoureth to open all prison doors 

still art thou a prisoner  it seemeth to me  who deviseth liberty
for himself  ah  sharp becometh the soul of such prisoners  but also
deceitful and wicked 

to purify himself  is still necessary for the freedman of the spirit 
much of the prison and the mould still remaineth in him  pure hath his
eye still to become 

yea  i know thy danger  but by my love and hope i conjure thee  cast not
thy love and hope away 

noble thou feelest thyself still  and noble others also feel thee still 
though they bear thee a grudge and cast evil looks  know this  that to
everybody a noble one standeth in the way 

also to the good  a noble one standeth in the way  and even when they
call him a good man  they want thereby to put him aside 

the new  would the noble man create  and a new virtue  the old  wanteth
the good man  and that the old should be conserved 

but it is not the danger of the noble man to turn a good man  but lest
he should become a blusterer  a scoffer  or a destroyer 

ah  i have known noble ones who lost their highest hope  and then they
disparaged all high hopes 

then lived they shamelessly in temporary pleasures  and beyond the day
had hardly an aim 

 spirit is also voluptuousness    said they  then broke the wings of
their spirit  and now it creepeth about  and defileth where it gnaweth 

once they thought of becoming heroes  but sensualists are they now  a
trouble and a terror is the hero to them 

but by my love and hope i conjure thee  cast not away the hero in thy
soul  maintain holy thy highest hope   

thus spake zarathustra 




ix  the preachers of death 

there are preachers of death  and the earth is full of those to whom
desistance from life must be preached 

full is the earth of the superfluous  marred is life by the
many too many  may they be decoyed out of this life by the  life
eternal  

 the yellow ones   so are called the preachers of death  or  the black
ones   but i will show them unto you in other colours besides 

there are the terrible ones who carry about in themselves the beast of
prey  and have no choice except lusts or self laceration  and even their
lusts are self laceration 

they have not yet become men  those terrible ones  may they preach
desistance from life  and pass away themselves 

there are the spiritually consumptive ones  hardly are they born when
they begin to die  and long for doctrines of lassitude and renunciation 

they would fain be dead  and we should approve of their wish  let
us beware of awakening those dead ones  and of damaging those living
coffins 

they meet an invalid  or an old man  or a corpse  and immediately they
say   life is refuted  

but they only are refuted  and their eye  which seeth only one aspect of
existence 

shrouded in thick melancholy  and eager for the little casualties that
bring death  thus do they wait  and clench their teeth 

or else  they grasp at sweetmeats  and mock at their childishness
thereby  they cling to their straw of life  and mock at their still
clinging to it 

their wisdom speaketh thus   a fool  he who remaineth alive  but so far
are we fools  and that is the foolishest thing in life  

 life is only suffering   so say others  and lie not  then see to it
that ye cease  see to it that the life ceaseth which is only suffering 

and let this be the teaching of your virtue   thou shalt slay thyself 
thou shalt steal away from thyself    

 lust is sin    so say some who preach death   let us go apart and beget
no children  

 giving birth is troublesome    say others   why still give birth  one
beareth only the unfortunate   and they also are preachers of death 

 pity is necessary    so saith a third party   take what i have  take
what i am  so much less doth life bind me  

were they consistently pitiful  then would they make their neighbours
sick of life  to be wicked  that would be their true goodness 

but they want to be rid of life  what care they if they bind others
still faster with their chains and gifts   

and ye also  to whom life is rough labour and disquiet  are ye not very
tired of life  are ye not very ripe for the sermon of death 

all ye to whom rough labour is dear  and the rapid  new  and strange  ye
put up with yourselves badly  your diligence is flight  and the will to
self forgetfulness 

if ye believed more in life  then would ye devote yourselves less to the
momentary  but for waiting  ye have not enough of capacity in you  nor
even for idling 

everywhere resoundeth the voices of those who preach death  and the
earth is full of those to whom death hath to be preached 

or  life eternal   it is all the same to me  if only they pass away
quickly   

thus spake zarathustra 




x  war and warriors 

by our best enemies we do not want to be spared  nor by those either
whom we love from the very heart  so let me tell you the truth 

my brethren in war  i love you from the very heart  i am  and was ever 
your counterpart  and i am also your best enemy  so let me tell you the
truth 

i know the hatred and envy of your hearts  ye are not great enough not
to know of hatred and envy  then be great enough not to be ashamed of
them 

and if ye cannot be saints of knowledge  then  i pray you  be at least
its warriors  they are the companions and forerunners of such saintship 

i see many soldiers  could i but see many warriors   uniform  one
calleth what they wear  may it not be uniform what they therewith hide 

ye shall be those whose eyes ever seek for an enemy  for your enemy  and
with some of you there is hatred at first sight 

your enemy shall ye seek  your war shall ye wage  and for the sake of
your thoughts  and if your thoughts succumb  your uprightness shall
still shout triumph thereby 

ye shall love peace as a means to new wars  and the short peace more
than the long 

you i advise not to work  but to fight  you i advise not to peace  but
to victory  let your work be a fight  let your peace be a victory 

one can only be silent and sit peacefully when one hath arrow and bow 
otherwise one prateth and quarrelleth  let your peace be a victory 

ye say it is the good cause which halloweth even war  i say unto you  it
is the good war which halloweth every cause 

war and courage have done more great things than charity  not your
sympathy  but your bravery hath hitherto saved the victims 

 what is good   ye ask  to be brave is good  let the little girls say 
 to be good is what is pretty  and at the same time touching  

they call you heartless  but your heart is true  and i love the
bashfulness of your goodwill  ye are ashamed of your flow  and others
are ashamed of their ebb 

ye are ugly  well then  my brethren  take the sublime about you  the
mantle of the ugly 

and when your soul becometh great  then doth it become haughty  and in
your sublimity there is wickedness  i know you 

in wickedness the haughty man and the weakling meet  but they
misunderstand one another  i know you 

ye shall only have enemies to be hated  but not enemies to be despised 
ye must be proud of your enemies  then  the successes of your enemies
are also your successes 

resistance  that is the distinction of the slave  let your distinction
be obedience  let your commanding itself be obeying 

to the good warrior soundeth  thou shalt  pleasanter than  i will   and
all that is dear unto you  ye shall first have it commanded unto you 

let your love to life be love to your highest hope  and let your highest
hope be the highest thought of life 

your highest thought  however  ye shall have it commanded unto you by
me  and it is this  man is something that is to be surpassed 

so live your life of obedience and of war  what matter about long life 
what warrior wisheth to be spared 

i spare you not  i love you from my very heart  my brethren in war   

thus spake zarathustra 




xi  the new idol 

somewhere there are still peoples and herds  but not with us  my
brethren  here there are states 

a state  what is that  well  open now your ears unto me  for now will i
say unto you my word concerning the death of peoples 

a state  is called the coldest of all cold monsters  coldly lieth
it also  and this lie creepeth from its mouth   i  the state  am the
people  

it is a lie  creators were they who created peoples  and hung a faith
and a love over them  thus they served life 

destroyers  are they who lay snares for many  and call it the state 
they hang a sword and a hundred cravings over them 

where there is still a people  there the state is not understood  but
hated as the evil eye  and as sin against laws and customs 

this sign i give unto you  every people speaketh its language of good
and evil  this its neighbour understandeth not  its language hath it
devised for itself in laws and customs 

but the state lieth in all languages of good and evil  and whatever it
saith it lieth  and whatever it hath it hath stolen 

false is everything in it  with stolen teeth it biteth  the biting one 
false are even its bowels 

confusion of language of good and evil  this sign i give unto you as
the sign of the state  verily  the will to death  indicateth this sign 
verily  it beckoneth unto the preachers of death 

many too many are born  for the superfluous ones was the state devised 

see just how it enticeth them to it  the many too many  how it
swalloweth and cheweth and recheweth them 

 on earth there is nothing greater than i  it is i who am the regulating
finger of god   thus roareth the monster  and not only the long eared
and short sighted fall upon their knees 

ah  even in your ears  ye great souls  it whispereth its gloomy lies 
ah  it findeth out the rich hearts which willingly lavish themselves 

yea  it findeth you out too  ye conquerors of the old god  weary ye
became of the conflict  and now your weariness serveth the new idol 

heroes and honourable ones  it would fain set up around it  the new
idol  gladly it basketh in the sunshine of good consciences   the cold
monster 

everything will it give you  if ye worship it  the new idol  thus it
purchaseth the lustre of your virtue  and the glance of your proud eyes 

it seeketh to allure by means of you  the many too many  yea  a hellish
artifice hath here been devised  a death horse jingling with the
trappings of divine honours 

yea  a dying for many hath here been devised  which glorifieth itself as
life  verily  a hearty service unto all preachers of death 

the state  i call it  where all are poison drinkers  the good and the
bad  the state  where all lose themselves  the good and the bad  the
state  where the slow suicide of all  is called  life  

just see these superfluous ones  they steal the works of the inventors
and the treasures of the wise  culture  they call their theft  and
everything becometh sickness and trouble unto them 

just see these superfluous ones  sick are they always  they vomit their
bile and call it a newspaper  they devour one another  and cannot even
digest themselves 

just see these superfluous ones  wealth they acquire and become poorer
thereby  power they seek for  and above all  the lever of power  much
money  these impotent ones 

see them clamber  these nimble apes  they clamber over one another  and
thus scuffle into the mud and the abyss 

towards the throne they all strive  it is their madness  as if happiness
sat on the throne  ofttimes sitteth filth on the throne   and ofttimes
also the throne on filth 

madmen they all seem to me  and clambering apes  and too eager  badly
smelleth their idol to me  the cold monster  badly they all smell to me 
these idolaters 

my brethren  will ye suffocate in the fumes of their maws and appetites 
better break the windows and jump into the open air 

do go out of the way of the bad odour  withdraw from the idolatry of the
superfluous 

do go out of the way of the bad odour  withdraw from the steam of these
human sacrifices 

open still remaineth the earth for great souls  empty are still many
sites for lone ones and twain ones  around which floateth the odour of
tranquil seas 

open still remaineth a free life for great souls  verily  he who
possesseth little is so much the less possessed  blessed be moderate
poverty 

there  where the state ceaseth  there only commenceth the man who is not
superfluous  there commenceth the song of the necessary ones  the single
and irreplaceable melody 

there  where the state ceaseth  pray look thither  my brethren  do ye
not see it  the rainbow and the bridges of the superman   

thus spake zarathustra 




xii  the flies in the market place 

flee  my friend  into thy solitude  i see thee deafened with the noise
of the great men  and stung all over with the stings of the little ones 

admirably do forest and rock know how to be silent with thee  resemble
again the tree which thou lovest  the broad branched one  silently and
attentively it o erhangeth the sea 

where solitude endeth  there beginneth the market place  and where the
market place beginneth  there beginneth also the noise of the great
actors  and the buzzing of the poison flies 

in the world even the best things are worthless without those who
represent them  those representers  the people call great men 

little do the people understand what is great  that is to say  the
creating agency  but they have a taste for all representers and actors
of great things 

around the devisers of new values revolveth the world   invisibly it
revolveth  but around the actors revolve the people and the glory  such
is the course of things 

spirit  hath the actor  but little conscience of the spirit  he
believeth always in that wherewith he maketh believe most strongly  in
himself 

tomorrow he hath a new belief  and the day after  one still newer  sharp
perceptions hath he  like the people  and changeable humours 

to upset  that meaneth with him to prove  to drive mad  that meaneth
with him to convince  and blood is counted by him as the best of all
arguments 

a truth which only glideth into fine ears  he calleth falsehood and
trumpery  verily  he believeth only in gods that make a great noise in
the world 

full of clattering buffoons is the market place   and the people glory
in their great men  these are for them the masters of the hour 

but the hour presseth them  so they press thee  and also from thee
they want yea or nay  alas  thou wouldst set thy chair betwixt for and
against 

on account of those absolute and impatient ones  be not jealous  thou
lover of truth  never yet did truth cling to the arm of an absolute one 

on account of those abrupt ones  return into thy security  only in the
market place is one assailed by yea  or nay 

slow is the experience of all deep fountains  long have they to wait
until they know what hath fallen into their depths 

away from the market place and from fame taketh place all that is great 
away from the market place and from fame have ever dwelt the devisers of
new values 

flee  my friend  into thy solitude  i see thee stung all over by the
poisonous flies  flee thither  where a rough  strong breeze bloweth 

flee into thy solitude  thou hast lived too closely to the small and the
pitiable  flee from their invisible vengeance  towards thee they have
nothing but vengeance 

raise no longer an arm against them  innumerable are they  and it is not
thy lot to be a fly flap 

innumerable are the small and pitiable ones  and of many a proud
structure  rain drops and weeds have been the ruin 

thou art not stone  but already hast thou become hollow by the numerous
drops  thou wilt yet break and burst by the numerous drops 

exhausted i see thee  by poisonous flies  bleeding i see thee  and torn
at a hundred spots  and thy pride will not even upbraid 

blood they would have from thee in all innocence  blood their bloodless
souls crave for  and they sting  therefore  in all innocence 

but thou  profound one  thou sufferest too profoundly even from small
wounds  and ere thou hadst recovered  the same poison worm crawled over
thy hand 

too proud art thou to kill these sweet tooths  but take care lest it be
thy fate to suffer all their poisonous injustice 

they buzz around thee also with their praise  obtrusiveness  is their
praise  they want to be close to thy skin and thy blood 

they flatter thee  as one flattereth a god or devil  they whimper before
thee  as before a god or devil  what doth it come to  flatterers are
they  and whimperers  and nothing more 

often  also  do they show themselves to thee as amiable ones  but that
hath ever been the prudence of the cowardly  yea  the cowardly are wise 

they think much about thee with their circumscribed souls  thou art
always suspected by them  whatever is much thought about is at last
thought suspicious 

they punish thee for all thy virtues  they pardon thee in their inmost
hearts only  for thine errors 

because thou art gentle and of upright character  thou sayest 
 blameless are they for their small existence   but their circumscribed
souls think   blamable is all great existence  

even when thou art gentle towards them  they still feel themselves
despised by thee  and they repay thy beneficence with secret
maleficence 

thy silent pride is always counter to their taste  they rejoice if once
thou be humble enough to be frivolous 

what we recognise in a man  we also irritate in him  therefore be on
your guard against the small ones 

in thy presence they feel themselves small  and their baseness gleameth
and gloweth against thee in invisible vengeance 

sawest thou not how often they became dumb when thou approachedst them 
and how their energy left them like the smoke of an extinguishing fire 

yea  my friend  the bad conscience art thou of thy neighbours  for they
are unworthy of thee  therefore they hate thee  and would fain suck thy
blood 

thy neighbours will always be poisonous flies  what is great in
thee  that itself must make them more poisonous  and always more
fly like 

flee  my friend  into thy solitude  and thither  where a rough strong
breeze bloweth  it is not thy lot to be a fly flap   

thus spake zarathustra 




xiii  chastity 

i love the forest  it is bad to live in cities  there  there are too
many of the lustful 

is it not better to fall into the hands of a murderer  than into the
dreams of a lustful woman 

and just look at these men  their eye saith it  they know nothing better
on earth than to lie with a woman 

filth is at the bottom of their souls  and alas  if their filth hath
still spirit in it 

would that ye were perfect  at least as animals  but to animals
belongeth innocence 

do i counsel you to slay your instincts  i counsel you to innocence in
your instincts 

do i counsel you to chastity  chastity is a virtue with some  but with
many almost a vice 

these are continent  to be sure  but doggish lust looketh enviously out
of all that they do 

even into the heights of their virtue and into their cold spirit doth
this creature follow them  with its discord 

and how nicely can doggish lust beg for a piece of spirit  when a piece
of flesh is denied it 

ye love tragedies and all that breaketh the heart  but i am distrustful
of your doggish lust 

ye have too cruel eyes  and ye look wantonly towards the sufferers 
hath not your lust just disguised itself and taken the name of
fellow suffering 

and also this parable give i unto you  not a few who meant to cast out
their devil  went thereby into the swine themselves 

to whom chastity is difficult  it is to be dissuaded  lest it become the
road to hell  to filth and lust of soul 

do i speak of filthy things  that is not the worst thing for me to do 

not when the truth is filthy  but when it is shallow  doth the
discerning one go unwillingly into its waters 

verily  there are chaste ones from their very nature  they are gentler
of heart  and laugh better and oftener than you 

they laugh also at chastity  and ask   what is chastity 

is chastity not folly  but the folly came unto us  and not we unto it 

we offered that guest harbour and heart  now it dwelleth with us  let it
stay as long as it will    

thus spake zarathustra 




xiv  the friend 

 one  is always too many about me   thinketh the anchorite   always once
one  that maketh two in the long run  

i and me are always too earnestly in conversation  how could it be
endured  if there were not a friend 

the friend of the anchorite is always the third one  the third one is
the cork which preventeth the conversation of the two sinking into the
depth 

ah  there are too many depths for all anchorites  therefore  do they
long so much for a friend  and for his elevation 

our faith in others betrayeth wherein we would fain have faith in
ourselves  our longing for a friend is our betrayer 

and often with our love we want merely to overleap envy  and often we
attack and make ourselves enemies  to conceal that we are vulnerable 

 be at least mine enemy    thus speaketh the true reverence  which doth
not venture to solicit friendship 

if one would have a friend  then must one also be willing to wage war
for him  and in order to wage war  one must be capable of being an
enemy 

one ought still to honour the enemy in one s friend  canst thou go nigh
unto thy friend  and not go over to him 

in one s friend one shall have one s best enemy  thou shalt be closest
unto him with thy heart when thou withstandest him 

thou wouldst wear no raiment before thy friend  it is in honour of thy
friend that thou showest thyself to him as thou art  but he wisheth thee
to the devil on that account 

he who maketh no secret of himself shocketh  so much reason have ye
to fear nakedness  aye  if ye were gods  ye could then be ashamed of
clothing 

thou canst not adorn thyself fine enough for thy friend  for thou shalt
be unto him an arrow and a longing for the superman 

sawest thou ever thy friend asleep  to know how he looketh  what is
usually the countenance of thy friend  it is thine own countenance  in a
coarse and imperfect mirror 

sawest thou ever thy friend asleep  wert thou not dismayed at thy friend
looking so  o my friend  man is something that hath to be surpassed 

in divining and keeping silence shall the friend be a master  not
everything must thou wish to see  thy dream shall disclose unto thee
what thy friend doeth when awake 

let thy pity be a divining  to know first if thy friend wanteth pity 
perhaps he loveth in thee the unmoved eye  and the look of eternity 

let thy pity for thy friend be hid under a hard shell  thou shalt bite
out a tooth upon it  thus will it have delicacy and sweetness 

art thou pure air and solitude and bread and medicine to thy friend 
many a one cannot loosen his own fetters  but is nevertheless his
friend s emancipator 

art thou a slave  then thou canst not be a friend  art thou a tyrant 
then thou canst not have friends 

far too long hath there been a slave and a tyrant concealed in woman 
on that account woman is not yet capable of friendship  she knoweth only
love 

in woman s love there is injustice and blindness to all she doth not
love  and even in woman s conscious love  there is still always surprise
and lightning and night  along with the light 

as yet woman is not capable of friendship  women are still cats  and
birds  or at the best  cows 

as yet woman is not capable of friendship  but tell me  ye men  who of
you are capable of friendship 

oh  your poverty  ye men  and your sordidness of soul  as much as ye
give to your friend  will i give even to my foe  and will not have
become poorer thereby 

there is comradeship  may there be friendship 

thus spake zarathustra 




xv  the thousand and one goals 

many lands saw zarathustra  and many peoples  thus he discovered the
good and bad of many peoples  no greater power did zarathustra find on
earth than good and bad 

no people could live without first valuing  if a people will maintain
itself  however  it must not value as its neighbour valueth 

much that passed for good with one people was regarded with scorn and
contempt by another  thus i found it  much found i here called bad 
which was there decked with purple honours 

never did the one neighbour understand the other  ever did his soul
marvel at his neighbour s delusion and wickedness 

a table of excellencies hangeth over every people  lo  it is the table
of their triumphs  lo  it is the voice of their will to power 

it is laudable  what they think hard  what is indispensable and hard
they call good  and what relieveth in the direst distress  the unique
and hardest of all   they extol as holy 

whatever maketh them rule and conquer and shine  to the dismay and envy
of their neighbours  they regard as the high and foremost thing  the
test and the meaning of all else 

verily  my brother  if thou knewest but a people s need  its land 
its sky  and its neighbour  then wouldst thou divine the law of its
surmountings  and why it climbeth up that ladder to its hope 

 always shalt thou be the foremost and prominent above others  no one
shall thy jealous soul love  except a friend   that made the soul of a
greek thrill  thereby went he his way to greatness 

 to speak truth  and be skilful with bow and arrow   so seemed it alike
pleasing and hard to the people from whom cometh my name  the name which
is alike pleasing and hard to me 

 to honour father and mother  and from the root of the soul to do their
will   this table of surmounting hung another people over them  and
became powerful and permanent thereby 

 to have fidelity  and for the sake of fidelity to risk honour and
blood  even in evil and dangerous courses   teaching itself so  another
people mastered itself  and thus mastering itself  became pregnant and
heavy with great hopes 

verily  men have given unto themselves all their good and bad  verily 
they took it not  they found it not  it came not unto them as a voice
from heaven 

values did man only assign to things in order to maintain himself  he
created only the significance of things  a human significance 
therefore  calleth he himself  man   that is  the valuator 

valuing is creating  hear it  ye creating ones  valuation itself is the
treasure and jewel of the valued things 

through valuation only is there value  and without valuation the nut of
existence would be hollow  hear it  ye creating ones 

change of values  that is  change of the creating ones  always doth he
destroy who hath to be a creator 

creating ones were first of all peoples  and only in late times
individuals  verily  the individual himself is still the latest
creation 

peoples once hung over them tables of the good  love which would rule
and love which would obey  created for themselves such tables 

older is the pleasure in the herd than the pleasure in the ego  and as
long as the good conscience is for the herd  the bad conscience only
saith  ego 

verily  the crafty ego  the loveless one  that seeketh its advantage in
the advantage of many  it is not the origin of the herd  but its ruin 

loving ones  was it always  and creating ones  that created good and
bad  fire of love gloweth in the names of all the virtues  and fire of
wrath 

many lands saw zarathustra  and many peoples  no greater power did
zarathustra find on earth than the creations of the loving ones   good 
 and  bad  are they called 

verily  a prodigy is this power of praising and blaming  tell me  ye
brethren  who will master it for me  who will put a fetter upon the
thousand necks of this animal 

a thousand goals have there been hitherto  for a thousand peoples have
there been  only the fetter for the thousand necks is still lacking 
there is lacking the one goal  as yet humanity hath not a goal 

but pray tell me  my brethren  if the goal of humanity be still lacking 
is there not also still lacking  humanity itself   

thus spake zarathustra 




xvi  neighbour love 

ye crowd around your neighbour  and have fine words for it  but i say
unto you  your neighbour love is your bad love of yourselves 

ye flee unto your neighbour from yourselves  and would fain make a
virtue thereof  but i fathom your  unselfishness  

the thou is older than the  i   the thou hath been consecrated  but not
yet the  i   so man presseth nigh unto his neighbour 

do i advise you to neighbour love  rather do i advise you to
neighbour flight and to furthest love 

higher than love to your neighbour is love to the furthest and future
ones  higher still than love to men  is love to things and phantoms 

the phantom that runneth on before thee  my brother  is fairer than
thou  why dost thou not give unto it thy flesh and thy bones  but thou
fearest  and runnest unto thy neighbour 

ye cannot endure it with yourselves  and do not love yourselves
sufficiently  so ye seek to mislead your neighbour into love  and would
fain gild yourselves with his error 

would that ye could not endure it with any kind of near ones  or their
neighbours  then would ye have to create your friend and his overflowing
heart out of yourselves 

ye call in a witness when ye want to speak well of yourselves  and
when ye have misled him to think well of you  ye also think well of
yourselves 

not only doth he lie  who speaketh contrary to his knowledge  but more
so  he who speaketh contrary to his ignorance  and thus speak ye
of yourselves in your intercourse  and belie your neighbour with
yourselves 

thus saith the fool   association with men spoileth the character 
especially when one hath none  

the one goeth to his neighbour because he seeketh himself  and the other
because he would fain lose himself  your bad love to yourselves maketh
solitude a prison to you 

the furthest ones are they who pay for your love to the near ones  and
when there are but five of you together  a sixth must always die 

i love not your festivals either  too many actors found i there  and
even the spectators often behaved like actors 

not the neighbour do i teach you  but the friend  let the friend be the
festival of the earth to you  and a foretaste of the superman 

i teach you the friend and his overflowing heart  but one must know how
to be a sponge  if one would be loved by overflowing hearts 

i teach you the friend in whom the world standeth complete  a capsule
of the good   the creating friend  who hath always a complete world to
bestow 

and as the world unrolled itself for him  so rolleth it together again
for him in rings  as the growth of good through evil  as the growth of
purpose out of chance 

let the future and the furthest be the motive of thy to day  in thy
friend shalt thou love the superman as thy motive 

my brethren  i advise you not to neighbour love  i advise you to
furthest love   

thus spake zarathustra 




xvii  the way of the creating one 

wouldst thou go into isolation  my brother  wouldst thou seek the way
unto thyself  tarry yet a little and hearken unto me 

 he who seeketh may easily get lost himself  all isolation is wrong   so
say the herd  and long didst thou belong to the herd 

the voice of the herd will still echo in thee  and when thou sayest 
 i have no longer a conscience in common with you   then will it be a
plaint and a pain 

lo  that pain itself did the same conscience produce  and the last gleam
of that conscience still gloweth on thine affliction 

but thou wouldst go the way of thine affliction  which is the way unto
thyself  then show me thine authority and thy strength to do so 

art thou a new strength and a new authority  a first motion  a
self rolling wheel  canst thou also compel stars to revolve around thee 

alas  there is so much lusting for loftiness  there are so many
convulsions of the ambitions  show me that thou art not a lusting and
ambitious one 

alas  there are so many great thoughts that do nothing more than the
bellows  they inflate  and make emptier than ever 

free  dost thou call thyself  thy ruling thought would i hear of  and
not that thou hast escaped from a yoke 

art thou one entitled to escape from a yoke  many a one hath cast away
his final worth when he hath cast away his servitude 

free from what  what doth that matter to zarathustra  clearly  however 
shall thine eye show unto me  free for what 

canst thou give unto thyself thy bad and thy good  and set up thy will
as a law over thee  canst thou be judge for thyself  and avenger of thy
law 

terrible is aloneness with the judge and avenger of one s own law 
thus is a star projected into desert space  and into the icy breath of
aloneness 

to day sufferest thou still from the multitude  thou individual  to day
hast thou still thy courage unabated  and thy hopes 

but one day will the solitude weary thee  one day will thy pride yield 
and thy courage quail  thou wilt one day cry   i am alone  

one day wilt thou see no longer thy loftiness  and see too closely thy
lowliness  thy sublimity itself will frighten thee as a phantom  thou
wilt one day cry   all is false  

there are feelings which seek to slay the lonesome one  if they do not
succeed  then must they themselves die  but art thou capable of it  to
be a murderer 

hast thou ever known  my brother  the word  disdain   and the anguish of
thy justice in being just to those that disdain thee 

thou forcest many to think differently about thee  that  charge they
heavily to thine account  thou camest nigh unto them  and yet wentest
past  for that they never forgive thee 

thou goest beyond them  but the higher thou risest  the smaller doth the
eye of envy see thee  most of all  however  is the flying one hated 

 how could ye be just unto me    must thou say   i choose your injustice
as my allotted portion  

injustice and filth cast they at the lonesome one  but  my brother  if
thou wouldst be a star  thou must shine for them none the less on that
account 

and be on thy guard against the good and just  they would fain crucify
those who devise their own virtue  they hate the lonesome ones 

be on thy guard  also  against holy simplicity  all is unholy to it that
is not simple  fain  likewise  would it play with the fire  of the fagot
and stake 

and be on thy guard  also  against the assaults of thy love  too readily
doth the recluse reach his hand to any one who meeteth him 

to many a one mayest thou not give thy hand  but only thy paw  and i
wish thy paw also to have claws 

but the worst enemy thou canst meet  wilt thou thyself always be  thou
waylayest thyself in caverns and forests 

thou lonesome one  thou goest the way to thyself  and past thyself and
thy seven devils leadeth thy way 

a heretic wilt thou be to thyself  and a wizard and a sooth sayer  and a
fool  and a doubter  and a reprobate  and a villain 

ready must thou be to burn thyself in thine own flame  how couldst thou
become new if thou have not first become ashes 

thou lonesome one  thou goest the way of the creating one  a god wilt
thou create for thyself out of thy seven devils 

thou lonesome one  thou goest the way of the loving one  thou lovest
thyself  and on that account despisest thou thyself  as only the loving
ones despise 

to create  desireth the loving one  because he despiseth  what knoweth
he of love who hath not been obliged to despise just what he loved 

with thy love  go into thine isolation  my brother  and with thy
creating  and late only will justice limp after thee 

with my tears  go into thine isolation  my brother  i love him who
seeketh to create beyond himself  and thus succumbeth   

thus spake zarathustra 




xviii  old and young women 

 why stealest thou along so furtively in the twilight  zarathustra  and
what hidest thou so carefully under thy mantle 

is it a treasure that hath been given thee  or a child that hath been
born thee  or goest thou thyself on a thief s errand  thou friend of the
evil    

verily  my brother  said zarathustra  it is a treasure that hath been
given me  it is a little truth which i carry 

but it is naughty  like a young child  and if i hold not its mouth  it
screameth too loudly 

as i went on my way alone to day  at the hour when the sun declineth 
there met me an old woman  and she spake thus unto my soul 

 much hath zarathustra spoken also to us women  but never spake he unto
us concerning woman  

and i answered her   concerning woman  one should only talk unto men  

 talk also unto me of woman   said she   i am old enough to forget it
presently  

and i obliged the old woman and spake thus unto her 

everything in woman is a riddle  and everything in woman hath one
solution  it is called pregnancy 

man is for woman a means  the purpose is always the child  but what is
woman for man 

two different things wanteth the true man  danger and diversion 
therefore wanteth he woman  as the most dangerous plaything 

man shall be trained for war  and woman for the recreation of the
warrior  all else is folly 

too sweet fruits  these the warrior liketh not  therefore liketh he
woman   bitter is even the sweetest woman 

better than man doth woman understand children  but man is more childish
than woman 

in the true man there is a child hidden  it wanteth to play  up then  ye
women  and discover the child in man 

a plaything let woman be  pure and fine like the precious stone 
illumined with the virtues of a world not yet come 

let the beam of a star shine in your love  let your hope say   may i
bear the superman  

in your love let there be valour  with your love shall ye assail him who
inspireth you with fear 

in your love be your honour  little doth woman understand otherwise
about honour  but let this be your honour  always to love more than ye
are loved  and never be the second 

let man fear woman when she loveth  then maketh she every sacrifice  and
everything else she regardeth as worthless 

let man fear woman when she hateth  for man in his innermost soul is
merely evil  woman  however  is mean 

whom hateth woman most   thus spake the iron to the loadstone   i hate
thee most  because thou attractest  but art too weak to draw unto thee  

the happiness of man is   i will   the happiness of woman is   he will  

 lo  now hath the world become perfect    thus thinketh every woman when
she obeyeth with all her love 

obey  must the woman  and find a depth for her surface  surface  is
woman s soul  a mobile  stormy film on shallow water 

man s soul  however  is deep  its current gusheth in subterranean
caverns  woman surmiseth its force  but comprehendeth it not   

then answered me the old woman   many fine things hath zarathustra said 
especially for those who are young enough for them 

strange  zarathustra knoweth little about woman  and yet he is right
about them  doth this happen  because with women nothing is impossible 

and now accept a little truth by way of thanks  i am old enough for it 

swaddle it up and hold its mouth  otherwise it will scream too loudly 
the little truth  

 give me  woman  thy little truth   said i  and thus spake the old
woman 

 thou goest to women  do not forget thy whip    

thus spake zarathustra 




xix  the bite of the adder 

one day had zarathustra fallen asleep under a fig tree  owing to the
heat  with his arms over his face  and there came an adder and bit him
in the neck  so that zarathustra screamed with pain  when he had
taken his arm from his face he looked at the serpent  and then did it
recognise the eyes of zarathustra  wriggled awkwardly  and tried to get
away   not at all   said zarathustra   as yet hast thou not received
my thanks  thou hast awakened me in time  my journey is yet long  
  thy journey is short   said the adder sadly   my poison is fatal  
 zarathustra smiled   when did ever a dragon die of a serpent s
poison    said he   but take thy poison back  thou art not rich enough
to present it to me   then fell the adder again on his neck  and licked
his wound 

when zarathustra once told this to his disciples they asked him 
 and what  o zarathustra  is the moral of thy story   and zarathustra
answered them thus 

the destroyer of morality  the good and just call me  my story is
immoral 

when  however  ye have an enemy  then return him not good for evil  for
that would abash him  but prove that he hath done something good to you 

and rather be angry than abash any one  and when ye are cursed  it
pleaseth me not that ye should then desire to bless  rather curse a
little also 

and should a great injustice befall you  then do quickly five small ones
besides  hideous to behold is he on whom injustice presseth alone 

did ye ever know this  shared injustice is half justice  and he who can
bear it  shall take the injustice upon himself 

a small revenge is humaner than no revenge at all  and if the punishment
be not also a right and an honour to the transgressor  i do not like
your punishing 

nobler is it to own oneself in the wrong than to establish one s right 
especially if one be in the right  only  one must be rich enough to do
so 

i do not like your cold justice  out of the eye of your judges there
always glanceth the executioner and his cold steel 

tell me  where find we justice  which is love with seeing eyes 

devise me  then  the love which not only beareth all punishment  but
also all guilt 

devise me  then  the justice which acquitteth every one except the
judge 

and would ye hear this likewise  to him who seeketh to be just from the
heart  even the lie becometh philanthropy 

but how could i be just from the heart  how can i give every one his
own  let this be enough for me  i give unto every one mine own 

finally  my brethren  guard against doing wrong to any anchorite  how
could an anchorite forget  how could he requite 

like a deep well is an anchorite  easy is it to throw in a stone  if
it should sink to the bottom  however  tell me  who will bring it out
again 

guard against injuring the anchorite  if ye have done so  however  well
then  kill him also   

thus spake zarathustra 




xx  child and marriage 

i have a question for thee alone  my brother  like a sounding lead  cast
i this question into thy soul  that i may know its depth 

thou art young  and desirest child and marriage  but i ask thee  art
thou a man entitled to desire a child 

art thou the victorious one  the self conqueror  the ruler of thy
passions  the master of thy virtues  thus do i ask thee 

or doth the animal speak in thy wish  and necessity  or isolation  or
discord in thee 

i would have thy victory and freedom long for a child  living monuments
shalt thou build to thy victory and emancipation 

beyond thyself shalt thou build  but first of all must thou be built
thyself  rectangular in body and soul 

not only onward shalt thou propagate thyself  but upward  for that
purpose may the garden of marriage help thee 

a higher body shalt thou create  a first movement  a spontaneously
rolling wheel  a creating one shalt thou create 

marriage  so call i the will of the twain to create the one that is
more than those who created it  the reverence for one another  as those
exercising such a will  call i marriage 

let this be the significance and the truth of thy marriage  but that
which the many too many call marriage  those superfluous ones  ah  what
shall i call it 

ah  the poverty of soul in the twain  ah  the filth of soul in the
twain  ah  the pitiable self complacency in the twain 

marriage they call it all  and they say their marriages are made in
heaven 

well  i do not like it  that heaven of the superfluous  no  i do not
like them  those animals tangled in the heavenly toils 

far from me also be the god who limpeth thither to bless what he hath
not matched 

laugh not at such marriages  what child hath not had reason to weep over
its parents 

worthy did this man seem  and ripe for the meaning of the earth  but
when i saw his wife  the earth seemed to me a home for madcaps 

yea  i would that the earth shook with convulsions when a saint and a
goose mate with one another 

this one went forth in quest of truth as a hero  and at last got for
himself a small decked up lie  his marriage he calleth it 

that one was reserved in intercourse and chose choicely  but one time he
spoilt his company for all time  his marriage he calleth it 

another sought a handmaid with the virtues of an angel  but all at once
he became the handmaid of a woman  and now would he need also to become
an angel 

careful  have i found all buyers  and all of them have astute eyes  but
even the astutest of them buyeth his wife in a sack 

many short follies  that is called love by you  and your marriage
putteth an end to many short follies  with one long stupidity 

your love to woman  and woman s love to man  ah  would that it were
sympathy for suffering and veiled deities  but generally two animals
alight on one another 

but even your best love is only an enraptured simile and a painful
ardour  it is a torch to light you to loftier paths 

beyond yourselves shall ye love some day  then learn first of all to
love  and on that account ye had to drink the bitter cup of your love 

bitterness is in the cup even of the best love  thus doth it cause
longing for the superman  thus doth it cause thirst in thee  the
creating one 

thirst in the creating one  arrow and longing for the superman  tell me 
my brother  is this thy will to marriage 

holy call i such a will  and such a marriage   

thus spake zarathustra 




xxi  voluntary death 

many die too late  and some die too early  yet strange soundeth the
precept   die at the right time 

die at the right time  so teacheth zarathustra 

to be sure  he who never liveth at the right time  how could he ever die
at the right time  would that he might never be born   thus do i advise
the superfluous ones 

but even the superfluous ones make much ado about their death  and even
the hollowest nut wanteth to be cracked 

every one regardeth dying as a great matter  but as yet death is not
a festival  not yet have people learned to inaugurate the finest
festivals 

the consummating death i show unto you  which becometh a stimulus and
promise to the living 

his death  dieth the consummating one triumphantly  surrounded by hoping
and promising ones 

thus should one learn to die  and there should be no festival at which
such a dying one doth not consecrate the oaths of the living 

thus to die is best  the next best  however  is to die in battle  and
sacrifice a great soul 

but to the fighter equally hateful as to the victor  is your grinning
death which stealeth nigh like a thief   and yet cometh as master 

my death  praise i unto you  the voluntary death  which cometh unto me
because  i  want it 

and when shall i want it   he that hath a goal and an heir  wanteth
death at the right time for the goal and the heir 

and out of reverence for the goal and the heir  he will hang up no more
withered wreaths in the sanctuary of life 

verily  not the rope makers will i resemble  they lengthen out their
cord  and thereby go ever backward 

many a one  also  waxeth too old for his truths and triumphs  a
toothless mouth hath no longer the right to every truth 

and whoever wanteth to have fame  must take leave of honour betimes  and
practise the difficult art of  going at the right time 

one must discontinue being feasted upon when one tasteth best  that is
known by those who want to be long loved 

sour apples are there  no doubt  whose lot is to wait until the last
day of autumn  and at the same time they become ripe  yellow  and
shrivelled 

in some ageth the heart first  and in others the spirit  and some are
hoary in youth  but the late young keep long young 

to many men life is a failure  a poison worm gnaweth at their heart 
then let them see to it that their dying is all the more a success 

many never become sweet  they rot even in the summer  it is cowardice
that holdeth them fast to their branches 

far too many live  and far too long hang they on their branches  would
that a storm came and shook all this rottenness and worm eatenness from
the tree 

would that there came preachers of speedy death  those would be the
appropriate storms and agitators of the trees of life  but i hear only
slow death preached  and patience with all that is  earthly  

ah  ye preach patience with what is earthly  this earthly is it that
hath too much patience with you  ye blasphemers 

verily  too early died that hebrew whom the preachers of slow death
honour  and to many hath it proved a calamity that he died too early 

as yet had he known only tears  and the melancholy of the hebrews 
together with the hatred of the good and just  the hebrew jesus  then
was he seized with the longing for death 

had he but remained in the wilderness  and far from the good and just 
then  perhaps  would he have learned to live  and love the earth  and
laughter also 

believe it  my brethren  he died too early  he himself would have
disavowed his doctrine had he attained to my age  noble enough was he to
disavow 

but he was still immature  immaturely loveth the youth  and immaturely
also hateth he man and earth  confined and awkward are still his soul
and the wings of his spirit 

but in man there is more of the child than in the youth  and less of
melancholy  better understandeth he about life and death 

free for death  and free in death  a holy naysayer  when there is no
longer time for yea  thus understandeth he about death and life 

that your dying may not be a reproach to man and the earth  my friends 
that do i solicit from the honey of your soul 

in your dying shall your spirit and your virtue still shine like an
evening after glow around the earth  otherwise your dying hath been
unsatisfactory 

thus will i die myself  that ye friends may love the earth more for my
sake  and earth will i again become  to have rest in her that bore me 

verily  a goal had zarathustra  he threw his ball  now be ye friends the
heirs of my goal  to you throw i the golden ball 

best of all  do i see you  my friends  throw the golden ball  and so
tarry i still a little while on the earth  pardon me for it 

thus spake zarathustra 




xxii  the bestowing virtue 

1 

when zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was
attached  the name of which is  the pied cow   there followed him many
people who called themselves his disciples  and kept him company  thus
came they to a crossroad  then zarathustra told them that he now wanted
to go alone  for he was fond of going alone  his disciples  however 
presented him at his departure with a staff  on the golden handle of
which a serpent twined round the sun  zarathustra rejoiced on account
of the staff  and supported himself thereon  then spake he thus to his
disciples 

tell me  pray  how came gold to the highest value  because it is
uncommon  and unprofiting  and beaming  and soft in lustre  it always
bestoweth itself 

only as image of the highest virtue came gold to the highest value 
goldlike  beameth the glance of the bestower  gold lustre maketh peace
between moon and sun 

uncommon is the highest virtue  and unprofiting  beaming is it  and soft
of lustre  a bestowing virtue is the highest virtue 

verily  i divine you well  my disciples  ye strive like me for the
bestowing virtue  what should ye have in common with cats and wolves 

it is your thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves  and
therefore have ye the thirst to accumulate all riches in your soul 

insatiably striveth your soul for treasures and jewels  because your
virtue is insatiable in desiring to bestow 

ye constrain all things to flow towards you and into you  so that they
shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love 

verily  an appropriator of all values must such bestowing love become 
but healthy and holy  call i this selfishness   

another selfishness is there  an all too poor and hungry kind  which
would always steal  the selfishness of the sick  the sickly selfishness 

with the eye of the thief it looketh upon all that is lustrous  with the
craving of hunger it measureth him who hath abundance  and ever doth it
prowl round the tables of bestowers 

sickness speaketh in such craving  and invisible degeneration  of a
sickly body  speaketh the larcenous craving of this selfishness 

tell me  my brother  what do we think bad  and worst of all  is it not
degeneration   and we always suspect degeneration when the bestowing
soul is lacking 

upward goeth our course from genera on to super genera  but a horror to
us is the degenerating sense  which saith   all for myself  

upward soareth our sense  thus is it a simile of our body  a simile of
an elevation  such similes of elevations are the names of the virtues 

thus goeth the body through history  a becomer and fighter  and the
spirit  what is it to the body  its fights  and victories  herald  its
companion and echo 

similes  are all names of good and evil  they do not speak out  they
only hint  a fool who seeketh knowledge from them 

give heed  my brethren  to every hour when your spirit would speak in
similes  there is the origin of your virtue 

elevated is then your body  and raised up  with its delight  enraptureth
it the spirit  so that it becometh creator  and valuer  and lover  and
everything s benefactor 

when your heart overfloweth broad and full like the river  a blessing
and a danger to the lowlanders  there is the origin of your virtue 

when ye are exalted above praise and blame  and your will would command
all things  as a loving one s will  there is the origin of your virtue 

when ye despise pleasant things  and the effeminate couch  and cannot
couch far enough from the effeminate  there is the origin of your
virtue 

when ye are willers of one will  and when that change of every need is
needful to you  there is the origin of your virtue 

verily  a new good and evil is it  verily  a new deep murmuring  and the
voice of a new fountain 

power is it  this new virtue  a ruling thought is it  and around it a
subtle soul  a golden sun  with the serpent of knowledge around it 

2 

here paused zarathustra awhile  and looked lovingly on his disciples 
then he continued to speak thus  and his voice had changed 

remain true to the earth  my brethren  with the power of your virtue 
let your bestowing love and your knowledge be devoted to be the meaning
of the earth  thus do i pray and conjure you 

let it not fly away from the earthly and beat against eternal walls with
its wings  ah  there hath always been so much flown away virtue 

lead  like me  the flown away virtue back to the earth  yea  back
to body and life  that it may give to the earth its meaning  a human
meaning 

a hundred times hitherto hath spirit as well as virtue flown away
and blundered  alas  in our body dwelleth still all this delusion and
blundering  body and will hath it there become 

a hundred times hitherto hath spirit as well as virtue attempted and
erred  yea  an attempt hath man been  alas  much ignorance and error
hath become embodied in us 

not only the rationality of millenniums  also their madness  breaketh
out in us  dangerous is it to be an heir 

still fight we step by step with the giant chance  and over all mankind
hath hitherto ruled nonsense  the lack of sense 

let your spirit and your virtue be devoted to the sense of the earth 
my brethren  let the value of everything be determined anew by you 
therefore shall ye be fighters  therefore shall ye be creators 

intelligently doth the body purify itself  attempting with intelligence
it exalteth itself  to the discerners all impulses sanctify themselves 
to the exalted the soul becometh joyful 

physician  heal thyself  then wilt thou also heal thy patient  let it be
his best cure to see with his eyes him who maketh himself whole 

a thousand paths are there which have never yet been trodden  a thousand
salubrities and hidden islands of life  unexhausted and undiscovered is
still man and man s world 

awake and hearken  ye lonesome ones  from the future come winds with
stealthy pinions  and to fine ears good tidings are proclaimed 

ye lonesome ones of to day  ye seceding ones  ye shall one day be a
people  out of you who have chosen yourselves  shall a chosen people
arise   and out of it the superman 

verily  a place of healing shall the earth become  and already is a new
odour diffused around it  a salvation bringing odour  and a new hope 

3 

when zarathustra had spoken these words  he paused  like one who had not
said his last word  and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in his
hand  at last he spake thus  and his voice had changed 

i now go alone  my disciples  ye also now go away  and alone  so will i
have it 

verily  i advise you  depart from me  and guard yourselves against
zarathustra  and better still  be ashamed of him  perhaps he hath
deceived you 

the man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies  but also
to hate his friends 

one requiteth a teacher badly if one remain merely a scholar  and why
will ye not pluck at my wreath 

ye venerate me  but what if your veneration should some day collapse 
take heed lest a statue crush you 

ye say  ye believe in zarathustra  but of what account is zarathustra 
ye are my believers  but of what account are all believers 

ye had not yet sought yourselves  then did ye find me  so do all
believers  therefore all belief is of so little account 

now do i bid you lose me and find yourselves  and only when ye have all
denied me  will i return unto you 

verily  with other eyes  my brethren  shall i then seek my lost ones 
with another love shall i then love you 

and once again shall ye have become friends unto me  and children of one
hope  then will i be with you for the third time  to celebrate the great
noontide with you 

and it is the great noontide  when man is in the middle of his course
between animal and superman  and celebrateth his advance to the evening
as his highest hope  for it is the advance to a new morning 

at such time will the down goer bless himself  that he should be an
over goer  and the sun of his knowledge will be at noontide 

 dead are all the gods  now do we desire the superman to live    let
this be our final will at the great noontide   

thus spake zarathustra 




thus spake zarathustra  second part 

   and only when ye have all denied me  will i return unto you 

verily  with other eyes  my brethren  shall i then seek my lost ones 
with another love shall i then love you    zarathustra  i    the
bestowing virtue  




xxiii  the child with the mirror 

after this zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the solitude
of his cave  and withdrew himself from men  waiting like a sower who
hath scattered his seed  his soul  however  became impatient and full of
longing for those whom he loved  because he had still much to give them 
for this is hardest of all  to close the open hand out of love  and keep
modest as a giver 

thus passed with the lonesome one months and years  his wisdom meanwhile
increased  and caused him pain by its abundance 

one morning  however  he awoke ere the rosy dawn  and having meditated
long on his couch  at last spake thus to his heart 

why did i startle in my dream  so that i awoke  did not a child come to
me  carrying a mirror 

 o zarathustra   said the child unto me   look at thyself in the
mirror  

but when i looked into the mirror  i shrieked  and my heart throbbed 
for not myself did i see therein  but a devil s grimace and derision 

verily  all too well do i understand the dream s portent and monition 
my doctrine is in danger  tares want to be called wheat 

mine enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of
my doctrine  so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that i
gave them 

lost are my friends  the hour hath come for me to seek my lost ones   

with these words zarathustra started up  not however like a person in
anguish seeking relief  but rather like a seer and a singer whom the
spirit inspireth  with amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon
him  for a coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn 

what hath happened unto me  mine animals   said zarathustra  am i not
transformed  hath not bliss come unto me like a whirlwind 

foolish is my happiness  and foolish things will it speak  it is still
too young  so have patience with it 

wounded am i by my happiness  all sufferers shall be physicians unto me 

to my friends can i again go down  and also to mine enemies  zarathustra
can again speak and bestow  and show his best love to his loved ones 

my impatient love overfloweth in streams   down towards sunrise and
sunset  out of silent mountains and storms of affliction  rusheth my
soul into the valleys 

too long have i longed and looked into the distance  too long hath
solitude possessed me  thus have i unlearned to keep silence 

utterance have i become altogether  and the brawling of a brook from
high rocks  downward into the valleys will i hurl my speech 

and let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels  how
should a stream not finally find its way to the sea 

forsooth  there is a lake in me  sequestered and self sufficing  but the
stream of my love beareth this along with it  down  to the sea 

new paths do i tread  a new speech cometh unto me  tired have i become  
like all creators  of the old tongues  no longer will my spirit walk on
worn out soles 

too slowly runneth all speaking for me   into thy chariot  o storm  do i
leap  and even thee will i whip with my spite 

like a cry and an huzza will i traverse wide seas  till i find the happy
isles where my friends sojourn   

and mine enemies amongst them  how i now love every one unto whom i may
but speak  even mine enemies pertain to my bliss 

and when i want to mount my wildest horse  then doth my spear always
help me up best  it is my foot s ever ready servant   

the spear which i hurl at mine enemies  how grateful am i to mine
enemies that i may at last hurl it 

too great hath been the tension of my cloud   twixt laughters of
lightnings will i cast hail showers into the depths 

violently will my breast then heave  violently will it blow its storm
over the mountains  thus cometh its assuagement 

verily  like a storm cometh my happiness  and my freedom  but mine
enemies shall think that the evil one roareth over their heads 

yea  ye also  my friends  will be alarmed by my wild wisdom  and perhaps
ye will flee therefrom  along with mine enemies 

ah  that i knew how to lure you back with shepherds  flutes  ah  that
my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly  and much have we already
learned with one another 

my wild wisdom became pregnant on the lonesome mountains  on the rough
stones did she bear the youngest of her young 

now runneth she foolishly in the arid wilderness  and seeketh and
seeketh the soft sward  mine old  wild wisdom 

on the soft sward of your hearts  my friends   on your love  would she
fain couch her dearest one   

thus spake zarathustra 




xxiv  in the happy isles 

the figs fall from the trees  they are good and sweet  and in falling
the red skins of them break  a north wind am i to ripe figs 

thus  like figs  do these doctrines fall for you  my friends  imbibe
now their juice and their sweet substance  it is autumn all around  and
clear sky  and afternoon 

lo  what fullness is around us  and out of the midst of superabundance 
it is delightful to look out upon distant seas 

once did people say god  when they looked out upon distant seas  now 
however  have i taught you to say  superman 

god is a conjecture  but i do not wish your conjecturing to reach beyond
your creating will 

could ye create a god   then  i pray you  be silent about all gods  but
ye could well create the superman 

not perhaps ye yourselves  my brethren  but into fathers and forefathers
of the superman could ye transform yourselves  and let that be your best
creating   

god is a conjecture  but i should like your conjecturing restricted to
the conceivable 

could ye conceive a god   but let this mean will to truth unto you 
that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable  the humanly
visible  the humanly sensible  your own discernment shall ye follow out
to the end 

and what ye have called the world shall but be created by you  your
reason  your likeness  your will  your love  shall it itself become  and
verily  for your bliss  ye discerning ones 

and how would ye endure life without that hope  ye discerning ones 
neither in the inconceivable could ye have been born  nor in the
irrational 

but that i may reveal my heart entirely unto you  my friends  if there
were gods  how could i endure it to be no god  therefore there are no
gods 

yea  i have drawn the conclusion  now  however  doth it draw me   

god is a conjecture  but who could drink all the bitterness of this
conjecture without dying  shall his faith be taken from the creating
one  and from the eagle his flights into eagle heights 

god is a thought  it maketh all the straight crooked  and all that
standeth reel  what  time would be gone  and all the perishable would be
but a lie 

to think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs  and even vomiting
to the stomach  verily  the reeling sickness do i call it  to conjecture
such a thing 

evil do i call it and misanthropic  all that teaching about the one  and
the plenum  and the unmoved  and the sufficient  and the imperishable 

all the imperishable  that s but a simile  and the poets lie too much   

but of time and of becoming shall the best similes speak  a praise shall
they be  and a justification of all perishableness 

creating  that is the great salvation from suffering  and life s
alleviation  but for the creator to appear  suffering itself is needed 
and much transformation 

yea  much bitter dying must there be in your life  ye creators  thus are
ye advocates and justifiers of all perishableness 

for the creator himself to be the new born child  he must also
be willing to be the child bearer  and endure the pangs of the
child bearer 

verily  through a hundred souls went i my way  and through a hundred
cradles and birth throes  many a farewell have i taken  i know the
heart breaking last hours 

but so willeth it my creating will  my fate  or  to tell you it more
candidly  just such a fate  willeth my will 

all feeling suffereth in me  and is in prison  but my willing ever
cometh to me as mine emancipator and comforter 

willing emancipateth  that is the true doctrine of will and
emancipation  so teacheth you zarathustra 

no longer willing  and no longer valuing  and no longer creating  ah 
that that great debility may ever be far from me 

and also in discerning do i feel only my will s procreating and evolving
delight  and if there be innocence in my knowledge  it is because there
is will to procreation in it 

away from god and gods did this will allure me  what would there be to
create if there were  gods 

but to man doth it ever impel me anew  my fervent creative will  thus
impelleth it the hammer to the stone 

ah  ye men  within the stone slumbereth an image for me  the image of my
visions  ah  that it should slumber in the hardest  ugliest stone 

now rageth my hammer ruthlessly against its prison  from the stone fly
the fragments  what s that to me 

i will complete it  for a shadow came unto me  the stillest and lightest
of all things once came unto me 

the beauty of the superman came unto me as a shadow  ah  my brethren  of
what account now are  the gods to me   

thus spake zarathustra 




xxv  the pitiful 

my friends  there hath arisen a satire on your friend   behold
zarathustra  walketh he not amongst us as if amongst animals  

but it is better said in this wise   the discerning one walketh amongst
men as amongst animals  

man himself is to the discerning one  the animal with red cheeks 

how hath that happened unto him  is it not because he hath had to be
ashamed too oft 

o my friends  thus speaketh the discerning one  shame  shame 
shame  that is the history of man 

and on that account doth the noble one enjoin upon himself not to abash 
bashfulness doth he enjoin on himself in presence of all sufferers 

verily  i like them not  the merciful ones  whose bliss is in their
pity  too destitute are they of bashfulness 

if i must be pitiful  i dislike to be called so  and if i be so  it is
preferably at a distance 

preferably also do i shroud my head  and flee  before being recognised 
and thus do i bid you do  my friends 

may my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path  and
those with whom i may have hope and repast and honey in common 

verily  i have done this and that for the afflicted  but something
better did i always seem to do when i had learned to enjoy myself
better 

since humanity came into being  man hath enjoyed himself too little 
that alone  my brethren  is our original sin 

and when we learn better to enjoy ourselves  then do we unlearn best to
give pain unto others  and to contrive pain 

therefore do i wash the hand that hath helped the sufferer  therefore do
i wipe also my soul 

for in seeing the sufferer suffering  thereof was i ashamed on account
of his shame  and in helping him  sorely did i wound his pride 

great obligations do not make grateful  but revengeful  and when a small
kindness is not forgotten  it becometh a gnawing worm 

 be shy in accepting  distinguish by accepting    thus do i advise those
who have naught to bestow 

i  however  am a bestower  willingly do i bestow as friend to friends 
strangers  however  and the poor  may pluck for themselves the fruit
from my tree  thus doth it cause less shame 

beggars  however  one should entirely do away with  verily  it annoyeth
one to give unto them  and it annoyeth one not to give unto them 

and likewise sinners and bad consciences  believe me  my friends  the
sting of conscience teacheth one to sting 

the worst things  however  are the petty thoughts  verily  better to
have done evilly than to have thought pettily 

to be sure  ye say   the delight in petty evils spareth one many a great
evil deed   but here one should not wish to be sparing 

like a boil is the evil deed  it itcheth and irritateth and breaketh
forth  it speaketh honourably 

 behold  i am disease   saith the evil deed  that is its honourableness 

but like infection is the petty thought  it creepeth and hideth  and
wanteth to be nowhere  until the whole body is decayed and withered by
the petty infection 

to him however  who is possessed of a devil  i would whisper this word
in the ear   better for thee to rear up thy devil  even for thee there
is still a path to greatness    

ah  my brethren  one knoweth a little too much about every one  and many
a one becometh transparent to us  but still we can by no means penetrate
him 

it is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult 

and not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair  but to him who
doth not concern us at all 

if  however  thou hast a suffering friend  then be a resting place for
his suffering  like a hard bed  however  a camp bed  thus wilt thou
serve him best 

and if a friend doeth thee wrong  then say   i forgive thee what thou
hast done unto me  that thou hast done it unto thyself  however  how
could i forgive that  

thus speaketh all great love  it surpasseth even forgiveness and pity 

one should hold fast one s heart  for when one letteth it go  how
quickly doth one s head run away 

ah  where in the world have there been greater follies than with the
pitiful  and what in the world hath caused more suffering than the
follies of the pitiful 

woe unto all loving ones who have not an elevation which is above their
pity 

thus spake the devil unto me  once on a time   even god hath his hell 
it is his love for man  

and lately  did i hear him say these words   god is dead  of his pity
for man hath god died    

so be ye warned against pity  from thence there yet cometh unto men a
heavy cloud  verily  i understand weather signs 

but attend also to this word  all great love is above all its pity  for
it seeketh  to create what is loved 

 myself do i offer unto my love  and my neighbour as myself   such is
the language of all creators 

all creators  however  are hard   

thus spake zarathustra 




xxvi  the priests 

and one day zarathustra made a sign to his disciples  and spake these
words unto them 

 here are priests  but although they are mine enemies  pass them quietly
and with sleeping swords 

even among them there are heroes  many of them have suffered too much   
so they want to make others suffer 

bad enemies are they  nothing is more revengeful than their meekness 
and readily doth he soil himself who toucheth them 

but my blood is related to theirs  and i want withal to see my blood
honoured in theirs    

and when they had passed  a pain attacked zarathustra  but not long had
he struggled with the pain  when he began to speak thus 

it moveth my heart for those priests  they also go against my taste  but
that is the smallest matter unto me  since i am among men 

but i suffer and have suffered with them  prisoners are they unto me 
and stigmatised ones  he whom they call saviour put them in fetters   

in fetters of false values and fatuous words  oh  that some one would
save them from their saviour 

on an isle they once thought they had landed  when the sea tossed them
about  but behold  it was a slumbering monster 

false values and fatuous words  these are the worst monsters for
mortals  long slumbereth and waiteth the fate that is in them 

but at last it cometh and awaketh and devoureth and engulfeth whatever
hath built tabernacles upon it 

oh  just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built
themselves  churches  they call their sweet smelling caves 

oh  that falsified light  that mustified air  where the soul  may not
fly aloft to its height 

but so enjoineth their belief   on your knees  up the stair  ye
sinners  

verily  rather would i see a shameless one than the distorted eyes of
their shame and devotion 

who created for themselves such caves and penitence stairs  was it not
those who sought to conceal themselves  and were ashamed under the clear
sky 

and only when the clear sky looketh again through ruined roofs  and down
upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls  will i again turn my heart
to the seats of this god 

they called god that which opposed and afflicted them  and verily  there
was much hero spirit in their worship 

and they knew not how to love their god otherwise than by nailing men to
the cross 

as corpses they thought to live  in black draped they their corpses 
even in their talk do i still feel the evil flavour of charnel houses 

and he who liveth nigh unto them liveth nigh unto black pools  wherein
the toad singeth his song with sweet gravity 

better songs would they have to sing  for me to believe in their
saviour  more like saved ones would his disciples have to appear unto
me 

naked  would i like to see them  for beauty alone should preach
penitence  but whom would that disguised affliction convince 

verily  their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom s
seventh heaven  verily  they themselves never trod the carpets of
knowledge 

of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist  but into every
defect had they put their illusion  their stop gap  which they called
god 

in their pity was their spirit drowned  and when they swelled and
o erswelled with pity  there always floated to the surface a great
folly 

eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot bridge 
as if there were but one foot bridge to the future  verily  those
shepherds also were still of the flock 

small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds  but  my brethren 
what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto been 

characters of blood did they write on the way they went  and their folly
taught that truth is proved by blood 

but blood is the very worst witness to truth  blood tainteth the purest
teaching  and turneth it into delusion and hatred of heart 

and when a person goeth through fire for his teaching  what doth that
prove  it is more  verily  when out of one s own burning cometh one s
own teaching 

sultry heart and cold head  where these meet  there ariseth the
blusterer  the  saviour  

greater ones  verily  have there been  and higher born ones  than those
whom the people call saviours  those rapturous blusterers 

and by still greater ones than any of the saviours must ye be saved  my
brethren  if ye would find the way to freedom 

never yet hath there been a superman  naked have i seen both of them 
the greatest man and the smallest man   

all too similar are they still to each other  verily  even the greatest
found i  all too human   

thus spake zarathustra 




xxvii  the virtuous 

with thunder and heavenly fireworks must one speak to indolent and
somnolent senses 

but beauty s voice speaketh gently  it appealeth only to the most
awakened souls 

gently vibrated and laughed unto me to day my buckler  it was beauty s
holy laughing and thrilling 

at you  ye virtuous ones  laughed my beauty to day  and thus came its
voice unto me   they want  to be paid besides  

ye want to be paid besides  ye virtuous ones  ye want reward for virtue 
and heaven for earth  and eternity for your to day 

and now ye upbraid me for teaching that there is no reward giver 
nor paymaster  and verily  i do not even teach that virtue is its own
reward 

ah  this is my sorrow  into the basis of things have reward and
punishment been insinuated  and now even into the basis of your souls 
ye virtuous ones 

but like the snout of the boar shall my word grub up the basis of your
souls  a ploughshare will i be called by you 

all the secrets of your heart shall be brought to light  and when ye
lie in the sun  grubbed up and broken  then will also your falsehood be
separated from your truth 

for this is your truth  ye are too pure for the filth of the words 
vengeance  punishment  recompense  retribution 

ye love your virtue as a mother loveth her child  but when did one hear
of a mother wanting to be paid for her love 

it is your dearest self  your virtue  the ring s thirst is in you  to
reach itself again struggleth every ring  and turneth itself 

and like the star that goeth out  so is every work of your virtue  ever
is its light on its way and travelling  and when will it cease to be on
its way 

thus is the light of your virtue still on its way  even when its work
is done  be it forgotten and dead  still its ray of light liveth and
travelleth 

that your virtue is your self  and not an outward thing  a skin  or
a cloak  that is the truth from the basis of your souls  ye virtuous
ones   

but sure enough there are those to whom virtue meaneth writhing under
the lash  and ye have hearkened too much unto their crying 

and others are there who call virtue the slothfulness of their vices 
and when once their hatred and jealousy relax the limbs  their  justice 
 becometh lively and rubbeth its sleepy eyes 

and others are there who are drawn downwards  their devils draw them 
but the more they sink  the more ardently gloweth their eye  and the
longing for their god 

ah  their crying also hath reached your ears  ye virtuous ones   what i
am not  that  that is god to me  and virtue  

and others are there who go along heavily and creakingly  like carts
taking stones downhill  they talk much of dignity and virtue  their drag
they call virtue 

and others are there who are like eight day clocks when wound up  they
tick  and want people to call ticking  virtue 

verily  in those have i mine amusement  wherever i find such clocks i
shall wind them up with my mockery  and they shall even whirr thereby 

and others are proud of their modicum of righteousness  and for the sake
of it do violence to all things  so that the world is drowned in their
unrighteousness 

ah  how ineptly cometh the word  virtue  out of their mouth  and when
they say   i am just   it always soundeth like   i am just  revenged  

with their virtues they want to scratch out the eyes of their enemies 
and they elevate themselves only that they may lower others 

and again there are those who sit in their swamp  and speak thus from
among the bulrushes   virtue  that is to sit quietly in the swamp 

we bite no one  and go out of the way of him who would bite  and in all
matters we have the opinion that is given us  

and again there are those who love attitudes  and think that virtue is a
sort of attitude 

their knees continually adore  and their hands are eulogies of virtue 
but their heart knoweth naught thereof 

and again there are those who regard it as virtue to say   virtue
is necessary   but after all they believe only that policemen are
necessary 

and many a one who cannot see men s loftiness  calleth it virtue to see
their baseness far too well  thus calleth he his evil eye virtue   

and some want to be edified and raised up  and call it virtue  and
others want to be cast down   and likewise call it virtue 

and thus do almost all think that they participate in virtue  and at
least every one claimeth to be an authority on  good  and  evil  

but zarathustra came not to say unto all those liars and fools   what do
ye know of virtue  what could ye know of virtue    

but that ye  my friends  might become weary of the old words which ye
have learned from the fools and liars 

that ye might become weary of the words  reward    retribution  
  punishment    righteous vengeance    

that ye might become weary of saying   that an action is good is because
it is unselfish  

ah  my friends  that your very self be in your action  as the mother is
in the child  let that be your formula of virtue 

verily  i have taken from you a hundred formulae and your virtue s
favourite playthings  and now ye upbraid me  as children upbraid 

they played by the sea  then came there a wave and swept their
playthings into the deep  and now do they cry 

but the same wave shall bring them new playthings  and spread before
them new speckled shells 

thus will they be comforted  and like them shall ye also  my friends 
have your comforting  and new speckled shells   

thus spake zarathustra 




xxviii  the rabble 

life is a well of delight  but where the rabble also drink  there all
fountains are poisoned 

to everything cleanly am i well disposed  but i hate to see the grinning
mouths and the thirst of the unclean 

they cast their eye down into the fountain  and now glanceth up to me
their odious smile out of the fountain 

the holy water have they poisoned with their lustfulness  and when they
called their filthy dreams delight  then poisoned they also the words 

indignant becometh the flame when they put their damp hearts to the
fire  the spirit itself bubbleth and smoketh when the rabble approach
the fire 

mawkish and over mellow becometh the fruit in their hands  unsteady  and
withered at the top  doth their look make the fruit tree 

and many a one who hath turned away from life  hath only turned away
from the rabble  he hated to share with them fountain  flame  and fruit 

and many a one who hath gone into the wilderness and suffered thirst
with beasts of prey  disliked only to sit at the cistern with filthy
camel drivers 

and many a one who hath come along as a destroyer  and as a hailstorm
to all cornfields  wanted merely to put his foot into the jaws of the
rabble  and thus stop their throat 

and it is not the mouthful which hath most choked me  to know that life
itself requireth enmity and death and torture crosses   

but i asked once  and suffocated almost with my question  what  is the
rabble also necessary for life 

are poisoned fountains necessary  and stinking fires  and filthy dreams 
and maggots in the bread of life 

not my hatred  but my loathing  gnawed hungrily at my life  ah  ofttimes
became i weary of spirit  when i found even the rabble spiritual 

and on the rulers turned i my back  when i saw what they now call
ruling  to traffic and bargain for power  with the rabble 

amongst peoples of a strange language did i dwell  with stopped ears  so
that the language of their trafficking might remain strange unto me  and
their bargaining for power 

and holding my nose  i went morosely through all yesterdays and to days 
verily  badly smell all yesterdays and to days of the scribbling rabble 

like a cripple become deaf  and blind  and dumb  thus have i lived long 
that i might not live with the power rabble  the scribe rabble  and the
pleasure rabble 

toilsomely did my spirit mount stairs  and cautiously  alms of delight
were its refreshment  on the staff did life creep along with the blind
one 

what hath happened unto me  how have i freed myself from loathing 
who hath rejuvenated mine eye  how have i flown to the height where no
rabble any longer sit at the wells 

did my loathing itself create for me wings and fountain divining powers 
verily  to the loftiest height had i to fly  to find again the well of
delight 

oh  i have found it  my brethren  here on the loftiest height bubbleth
up for me the well of delight  and there is a life at whose waters none
of the rabble drink with me 

almost too violently dost thou flow for me  thou fountain of delight 
and often emptiest thou the goblet again  in wanting to fill it 

and yet must i learn to approach thee more modestly  far too violently
doth my heart still flow towards thee   

my heart on which my summer burneth  my short  hot  melancholy 
over happy summer  how my summer heart longeth for thy coolness 

past  the lingering distress of my spring  past  the wickedness of my
snowflakes in june  summer have i become entirely  and summer noontide 

a summer on the loftiest height  with cold fountains and blissful
stillness  oh  come  my friends  that the stillness may become more
blissful 

for this is our height and our home  too high and steep do we here dwell
for all uncleanly ones and their thirst 

cast but your pure eyes into the well of my delight  my friends  how
could it become turbid thereby  it shall laugh back to you with its
purity 

on the tree of the future build we our nest  eagles shall bring us lone
ones food in their beaks 

verily  no food of which the impure could be fellow partakers  fire 
would they think they devoured  and burn their mouths 

verily  no abodes do we here keep ready for the impure  an ice cave to
their bodies would our happiness be  and to their spirits 

and as strong winds will we live above them  neighbours to the eagles 
neighbours to the snow  neighbours to the sun  thus live the strong
winds 

and like a wind will i one day blow amongst them  and with my spirit 
take the breath from their spirit  thus willeth my future 

verily  a strong wind is zarathustra to all low places  and this counsel
counselleth he to his enemies  and to whatever spitteth and speweth 
 take care not to spit against the wind    

thus spake zarathustra 




xxix  the tarantulas 

lo  this is the tarantula s den  wouldst thou see the tarantula itself 
here hangeth its web  touch this  so that it may tremble 

there cometh the tarantula willingly  welcome  tarantula  black on thy
back is thy triangle and symbol  and i know also what is in thy soul 

revenge is in thy soul  wherever thou bitest  there ariseth black scab 
with revenge  thy poison maketh the soul giddy 

thus do i speak unto you in parable  ye who make the soul giddy 
ye preachers of equality  tarantulas are ye unto me  and secretly
revengeful ones 

but i will soon bring your hiding places to the light  therefore do i
laugh in your face my laughter of the height 

therefore do i tear at your web  that your rage may lure you out of your
den of lies  and that your revenge may leap forth from behind your word
 justice  

because  for man to be redeemed from revenge  that is for me the bridge
to the highest hope  and a rainbow after long storms 

otherwise  however  would the tarantulas have it   let it be
very justice for the world to become full of the storms of our
vengeance   thus do they talk to one another 

 vengeance will we use  and insult  against all who are not like
us   thus do the tarantula hearts pledge themselves 

 and  will to equality   that itself shall henceforth be the name of
virtue  and against all that hath power will we raise an outcry  

ye preachers of equality  the tyrant frenzy of impotence crieth thus in
you for  equality   your most secret tyrant longings disguise themselves
thus in virtue words 

fretted conceit and suppressed envy  perhaps your fathers  conceit and
envy  in you break they forth as flame and frenzy of vengeance 

what the father hath hid cometh out in the son  and oft have i found in
the son the father s revealed secret 

inspired ones they resemble  but it is not the heart that inspireth
them  but vengeance  and when they become subtle and cold  it is not
spirit  but envy  that maketh them so 

their jealousy leadeth them also into thinkers  paths  and this is the
sign of their jealousy  they always go too far  so that their fatigue
hath at last to go to sleep on the snow 

in all their lamentations soundeth vengeance  in all their eulogies is
maleficence  and being judge seemeth to them bliss 

but thus do i counsel you  my friends  distrust all in whom the impulse
to punish is powerful 

they are people of bad race and lineage  out of their countenances peer
the hangman and the sleuth hound 

distrust all those who talk much of their justice  verily  in their
souls not only honey is lacking 

and when they call themselves  the good and just   forget not  that for
them to be pharisees  nothing is lacking but  power 

my friends  i will not be mixed up and confounded with others 

there are those who preach my doctrine of life  and are at the same time
preachers of equality  and tarantulas 

that they speak in favour of life  though they sit in their den  these
poison spiders  and withdrawn from life  is because they would thereby
do injury 

to those would they thereby do injury who have power at present  for
with those the preaching of death is still most at home 

were it otherwise  then would the tarantulas teach otherwise  and they
themselves were formerly the best world maligners and heretic burners 

with these preachers of equality will i not be mixed up and confounded 
for thus speaketh justice unto me   men are not equal  

and neither shall they become so  what would be my love to the superman 
if i spake otherwise 

on a thousand bridges and piers shall they throng to the future  and
always shall there be more war and inequality among them  thus doth my
great love make me speak 

inventors of figures and phantoms shall they be in their hostilities 
and with those figures and phantoms shall they yet fight with each other
the supreme fight 

good and evil  and rich and poor  and high and low  and all names of
values  weapons shall they be  and sounding signs  that life must again
and again surpass itself 

aloft will it build itself with columns and stairs  life itself  into
remote distances would it gaze  and out towards blissful beauties  
therefore doth it require elevation 

and because it requireth elevation  therefore doth it require steps  and
variance of steps and climbers  to rise striveth life  and in rising to
surpass itself 

and just behold  my friends  here where the tarantula s den is  riseth
aloft an ancient temple s ruins  just behold it with enlightened eyes 

verily  he who here towered aloft his thoughts in stone  knew as well as
the wisest ones about the secret of life 

that there is struggle and inequality even in beauty  and war for power
and supremacy  that doth he here teach us in the plainest parable 

how divinely do vault and arch here contrast in the struggle  how with
light and shade they strive against each other  the divinely striving
ones   

thus  steadfast and beautiful  let us also be enemies  my friends 
divinely will we strive against one another   

alas  there hath the tarantula bit me myself  mine old enemy  divinely
steadfast and beautiful  it hath bit me on the finger 

 punishment must there be  and justice   so thinketh it   not
gratuitously shall he here sing songs in honour of enmity  

yea  it hath revenged itself  and alas  now will it make my soul also
dizzy with revenge 

that i may not turn dizzy  however  bind me fast  my friends  to this
pillar  rather will i be a pillar saint than a whirl of vengeance 

verily  no cyclone or whirlwind is zarathustra  and if he be a dancer 
he is not at all a tarantula dancer   

thus spake zarathustra 




xxx  the famous wise ones 

the people have ye served and the people s superstition  not the
truth   all ye famous wise ones  and just on that account did they pay
you reverence 

and on that account also did they tolerate your unbelief  because it
was a pleasantry and a by path for the people  thus doth the master give
free scope to his slaves  and even enjoyeth their presumptuousness 

but he who is hated by the people  as the wolf by the dogs  is the free
spirit  the enemy of fetters  the non adorer  the dweller in the woods 

to hunt him out of his lair  that was always called  sense of right  by
the people  on him do they still hound their sharpest toothed dogs 

 for there the truth is  where the people are  woe  woe to the seeking
ones    thus hath it echoed through all time 

your people would ye justify in their reverence  that called ye  will to
truth   ye famous wise ones 

and your heart hath always said to itself   from the people have i come 
from thence came to me also the voice of god  

stiff necked and artful  like the ass  have ye always been  as the
advocates of the people 

and many a powerful one who wanted to run well with the people  hath
harnessed in front of his horses  a donkey  a famous wise man 

and now  ye famous wise ones  i would have you finally throw off
entirely the skin of the lion 

the skin of the beast of prey  the speckled skin  and the dishevelled
locks of the investigator  the searcher  and the conqueror 

ah  for me to learn to believe in your  conscientiousness   ye would
first have to break your venerating will 

conscientious  so call i him who goeth into god forsaken wildernesses 
and hath broken his venerating heart 

in the yellow sands and burnt by the sun  he doubtless peereth thirstily
at the isles rich in fountains  where life reposeth under shady trees 

but his thirst doth not persuade him to become like those comfortable
ones  for where there are oases  there are also idols 

hungry  fierce  lonesome  god forsaken  so doth the lion will wish
itself 

free from the happiness of slaves  redeemed from deities and adorations 
fearless and fear inspiring  grand and lonesome  so is the will of the
conscientious 

in the wilderness have ever dwelt the conscientious  the free spirits 
as lords of the wilderness  but in the cities dwell the well foddered 
famous wise ones  the draught beasts 

for  always  do they draw  as asses  the people s carts 

not that i on that account upbraid them  but serving ones do they
remain  and harnessed ones  even though they glitter in golden harness 

and often have they been good servants and worthy of their hire  for
thus saith virtue   if thou must be a servant  seek him unto whom thy
service is most useful 

the spirit and virtue of thy master shall advance by thou being his
servant  thus wilt thou thyself advance with his spirit and virtue  

and verily  ye famous wise ones  ye servants of the people  ye
yourselves have advanced with the people s spirit and virtue  and the
people by you  to your honour do i say it 

but the people ye remain for me  even with your virtues  the people with
purblind eyes  the people who know not what spirit is 

spirit is life which itself cutteth into life  by its own torture doth
it increase its own knowledge   did ye know that before 

and the spirit s happiness is this  to be anointed and consecrated with
tears as a sacrificial victim   did ye know that before 

and the blindness of the blind one  and his seeking and groping  shall
yet testify to the power of the sun into which he hath gazed   did ye
know that before 

and with mountains shall the discerning one learn to build  it is
a small thing for the spirit to remove mountains   did ye know that
before 

ye know only the sparks of the spirit  but ye do not see the anvil which
it is  and the cruelty of its hammer 

verily  ye know not the spirit s pride  but still less could ye endure
the spirit s humility  should it ever want to speak 

and never yet could ye cast your spirit into a pit of snow  ye are not
hot enough for that  thus are ye unaware  also  of the delight of its
coldness 

in all respects  however  ye make too familiar with the spirit  and out
of wisdom have ye often made an almshouse and a hospital for bad poets 

ye are not eagles  thus have ye never experienced the happiness of the
alarm of the spirit  and he who is not a bird should not camp above
abysses 

ye seem to me lukewarm ones  but coldly floweth all deep knowledge 
ice cold are the innermost wells of the spirit  a refreshment to hot
hands and handlers 

respectable do ye there stand  and stiff  and with straight backs  ye
famous wise ones   no strong wind or will impelleth you 

have ye ne er seen a sail crossing the sea  rounded and inflated  and
trembling with the violence of the wind 

like the sail trembling with the violence of the spirit  doth my wisdom
cross the sea  my wild wisdom 

but ye servants of the people  ye famous wise ones  how could ye go with
me   

thus spake zarathustra 




xxxi  the night song 

 tis night  now do all gushing fountains speak louder  and my soul also
is a gushing fountain 

 tis night  now only do all songs of the loving ones awake  and my soul
also is the song of a loving one 

something unappeased  unappeasable  is within me  it longeth to find
expression  a craving for love is within me  which speaketh itself the
language of love 

light am i  ah  that i were night  but it is my lonesomeness to be
begirt with light 

ah  that i were dark and nightly  how would i suck at the breasts of
light 

and you yourselves would i bless  ye twinkling starlets and glow worms
aloft   and would rejoice in the gifts of your light 

but i live in mine own light  i drink again into myself the flames that
break forth from me 

i know not the happiness of the receiver  and oft have i dreamt that
stealing must be more blessed than receiving 

it is my poverty that my hand never ceaseth bestowing  it is mine envy
that i see waiting eyes and the brightened nights of longing 

oh  the misery of all bestowers  oh  the darkening of my sun  oh  the
craving to crave  oh  the violent hunger in satiety 

they take from me  but do i yet touch their soul  there is a gap  twixt
giving and receiving  and the smallest gap hath finally to be bridged
over 

a hunger ariseth out of my beauty  i should like to injure those i
illumine  i should like to rob those i have gifted   thus do i hunger
for wickedness 

withdrawing my hand when another hand already stretcheth out to it 
hesitating like the cascade  which hesitateth even in its leap   thus do
i hunger for wickedness 

such revenge doth mine abundance think of  such mischief welleth out of
my lonesomeness 

my happiness in bestowing died in bestowing  my virtue became weary of
itself by its abundance 

he who ever bestoweth is in danger of losing his shame  to him who ever
dispenseth  the hand and heart become callous by very dispensing 

mine eye no longer overfloweth for the shame of suppliants  my hand hath
become too hard for the trembling of filled hands 

whence have gone the tears of mine eye  and the down of my heart  oh 
the lonesomeness of all bestowers  oh  the silence of all shining ones 

many suns circle in desert space  to all that is dark do they speak with
their light  but to me they are silent 

oh  this is the hostility of light to the shining one  unpityingly doth
it pursue its course 

unfair to the shining one in its innermost heart  cold to the
suns   thus travelleth every sun 

like a storm do the suns pursue their courses  that is their travelling 
their inexorable will do they follow  that is their coldness 

oh  ye only is it  ye dark  nightly ones  that extract warmth from the
shining ones  oh  ye only drink milk and refreshment from the light s
udders 

ah  there is ice around me  my hand burneth with the iciness  ah  there
is thirst in me  it panteth after your thirst 

 tis night  alas  that i have to be light  and thirst for the nightly 
and lonesomeness 

 tis night  now doth my longing break forth in me as a fountain   for
speech do i long 

 tis night  now do all gushing fountains speak louder  and my soul also
is a gushing fountain 

 tis night  now do all songs of loving ones awake  and my soul also is
the song of a loving one   

thus sang zarathustra 




xxxii  the dance song 

one evening went zarathustra and his disciples through the forest  and
when he sought for a well  lo  he lighted upon a green meadow peacefully
surrounded with trees and bushes  where maidens were dancing together 
as soon as the maidens recognised zarathustra  they ceased dancing 
zarathustra  however  approached them with friendly mien and spake these
words 

cease not your dancing  ye lovely maidens  no game spoiler hath come to
you with evil eye  no enemy of maidens 

god s advocate am i with the devil  he  however  is the spirit of
gravity  how could i  ye light footed ones  be hostile to divine dances 
or to maidens  feet with fine ankles 

to be sure  i am a forest  and a night of dark trees  but he who is not
afraid of my darkness  will find banks full of roses under my cypresses 

and even the little god may he find  who is dearest to maidens  beside
the well lieth he quietly  with closed eyes 

verily  in broad daylight did he fall asleep  the sluggard  had he
perhaps chased butterflies too much 

upbraid me not  ye beautiful dancers  when i chasten the little god
somewhat  he will cry  certainly  and weep  but he is laughable even
when weeping 

and with tears in his eyes shall he ask you for a dance  and i myself
will sing a song to his dance 

a dance song and satire on the spirit of gravity my supremest 
powerfulest devil  who is said to be  lord of the world    

and this is the song that zarathustra sang when cupid and the maidens
danced together 

of late did i gaze into thine eye  o life  and into the unfathomable did
i there seem to sink 

but thou pulledst me out with a golden angle  derisively didst thou
laugh when i called thee unfathomable 

 such is the language of all fish   saidst thou   what they do not
fathom is unfathomable 

but changeable am i only  and wild  and altogether a woman  and no
virtuous one 

though i be called by you men the  profound one   or the  faithful one  
 the eternal one    the mysterious one  

but ye men endow us always with your own virtues  alas  ye virtuous
ones  

thus did she laugh  the unbelievable one  but never do i believe her and
her laughter  when she speaketh evil of herself 

and when i talked face to face with my wild wisdom  she said to me
angrily   thou willest  thou cravest  thou lovest  on that account alone
dost thou praise life  

then had i almost answered indignantly and told the truth to the angry
one  and one cannot answer more indignantly than when one  telleth the
truth  to one s wisdom 

for thus do things stand with us three  in my heart do i love only
life  and verily  most when i hate her 

but that i am fond of wisdom  and often too fond  is because she
remindeth me very strongly of life 

she hath her eye  her laugh  and even her golden angle rod  am i
responsible for it that both are so alike 

and when once life asked me   who is she then  this wisdom    then said
i eagerly   ah  yes  wisdom 

one thirsteth for her and is not satisfied  one looketh through veils 
one graspeth through nets 

is she beautiful  what do i know  but the oldest carps are still lured
by her 

changeable is she  and wayward  often have i seen her bite her lip  and
pass the comb against the grain of her hair 

perhaps she is wicked and false  and altogether a woman  but when she
speaketh ill of herself  just then doth she seduce most  

when i had said this unto life  then laughed she maliciously  and shut
her eyes   of whom dost thou speak   said she   perhaps of me 

and if thou wert right  is it proper to say that in such wise to my
face  but now  pray  speak also of thy wisdom  

ah  and now hast thou again opened thine eyes  o beloved life  and into
the unfathomable have i again seemed to sink   

thus sang zarathustra  but when the dance was over and the maidens had
departed  he became sad 

 the sun hath been long set   said he at last   the meadow is damp  and
from the forest cometh coolness 

an unknown presence is about me  and gazeth thoughtfully  what  thou
livest still  zarathustra 

why  wherefore  whereby  whither  where  how  is it not folly still to
live   

ah  my friends  the evening is it which thus interrogateth in me 
forgive me my sadness 

evening hath come on  forgive me that evening hath come on  

thus sang zarathustra 




xxxiii  the grave song 

 yonder is the grave island  the silent isle  yonder also are the graves
of my youth  thither will i carry an evergreen wreath of life  

resolving thus in my heart  did i sail o er the sea   

oh  ye sights and scenes of my youth  oh  all ye gleams of love  ye
divine fleeting gleams  how could ye perish so soon for me  i think of
you to day as my dead ones 

from you  my dearest dead ones  cometh unto me a sweet savour 
heart opening and melting  verily  it convulseth and openeth the heart
of the lone seafarer 

still am i the richest and most to be envied  i  the lonesomest one 
for i have possessed you  and ye possess me still  tell me  to whom hath
there ever fallen such rosy apples from the tree as have fallen unto me 

still am i your love s heir and heritage  blooming to your memory with
many hued  wild growing virtues  o ye dearest ones 

ah  we were made to remain nigh unto each other  ye kindly strange
marvels  and not like timid birds did ye come to me and my longing  nay 
but as trusting ones to a trusting one 

yea  made for faithfulness  like me  and for fond eternities  must i now
name you by your faithlessness  ye divine glances and fleeting gleams 
no other name have i yet learnt 

verily  too early did ye die for me  ye fugitives  yet did ye not flee
from me  nor did i flee from you  innocent are we to each other in our
faithlessness 

to kill me  did they strangle you  ye singing birds of my hopes  yea  at
you  ye dearest ones  did malice ever shoot its arrows  to hit my heart 

and they hit it  because ye were always my dearest  my possession and my
possessedness  on that account had ye to die young  and far too early 

at my most vulnerable point did they shoot the arrow  namely  at you 
whose skin is like down  or more like the smile that dieth at a glance 

but this word will i say unto mine enemies  what is all manslaughter in
comparison with what ye have done unto me 

worse evil did ye do unto me than all manslaughter  the irretrievable
did ye take from me   thus do i speak unto you  mine enemies 

slew ye not my youth s visions and dearest marvels  my playmates took ye
from me  the blessed spirits  to their memory do i deposit this wreath
and this curse 

this curse upon you  mine enemies  have ye not made mine eternal short 
as a tone dieth away in a cold night  scarcely  as the twinkle of divine
eyes  did it come to me  as a fleeting gleam 

thus spake once in a happy hour my purity   divine shall everything be
unto me  

then did ye haunt me with foul phantoms  ah  whither hath that happy
hour now fled 

 all days shall be holy unto me   so spake once the wisdom of my youth 
verily  the language of a joyous wisdom 

but then did ye enemies steal my nights  and sold them to sleepless
torture  ah  whither hath that joyous wisdom now fled 

once did i long for happy auspices  then did ye lead an owl monster
across my path  an adverse sign  ah  whither did my tender longing then
flee 

all loathing did i once vow to renounce  then did ye change my nigh ones
and nearest ones into ulcerations  ah  whither did my noblest vow then
flee 

as a blind one did i once walk in blessed ways  then did ye cast
filth on the blind one s course  and now is he disgusted with the old
footpath 

and when i performed my hardest task  and celebrated the triumph of
my victories  then did ye make those who loved me call out that i then
grieved them most 

verily  it was always your doing  ye embittered to me my best honey  and
the diligence of my best bees 

to my charity have ye ever sent the most impudent beggars  around my
sympathy have ye ever crowded the incurably shameless  thus have ye
wounded the faith of my virtue 

and when i offered my holiest as a sacrifice  immediately did your
 piety  put its fatter gifts beside it  so that my holiest suffocated in
the fumes of your fat 

and once did i want to dance as i had never yet danced  beyond all
heavens did i want to dance  then did ye seduce my favourite minstrel 

and now hath he struck up an awful  melancholy air  alas  he tooted as a
mournful horn to mine ear 

murderous minstrel  instrument of evil  most innocent instrument 
already did i stand prepared for the best dance  then didst thou slay my
rapture with thy tones 

only in the dance do i know how to speak the parable of the highest
things   and now hath my grandest parable remained unspoken in my limbs 

unspoken and unrealised hath my highest hope remained  and there have
perished for me all the visions and consolations of my youth 

how did i ever bear it  how did i survive and surmount such wounds  how
did my soul rise again out of those sepulchres 

yea  something invulnerable  unburiable is with me  something that would
rend rocks asunder  it is called my will  silently doth it proceed  and
unchanged throughout the years 

its course will it go upon my feet  mine old will  hard of heart is its
nature and invulnerable 

invulnerable am i only in my heel  ever livest thou there  and art like
thyself  thou most patient one  ever hast thou burst all shackles of the
tomb 

in thee still liveth also the unrealisedness of my youth  and as life
and youth sittest thou here hopeful on the yellow ruins of graves 

yea  thou art still for me the demolisher of all graves  hail to thee 
my will  and only where there are graves are there resurrections   

thus sang zarathustra 




xxxiv  self surpassing 

 will to truth  do ye call it  ye wisest ones  that which impelleth you
and maketh you ardent 

will for the thinkableness of all being  thus do  i  call your will 

all being would ye make thinkable  for ye doubt with good reason whether
it be already thinkable 

but it shall accommodate and bend itself to you  so willeth your will 
smooth shall it become and subject to the spirit  as its mirror and
reflection 

that is your entire will  ye wisest ones  as a will to power  and even
when ye speak of good and evil  and of estimates of value 

ye would still create a world before which ye can bow the knee  such is
your ultimate hope and ecstasy 

the ignorant  to be sure  the people  they are like a river on which a
boat floateth along  and in the boat sit the estimates of value  solemn
and disguised 

your will and your valuations have ye put on the river of becoming  it
betrayeth unto me an old will to power  what is believed by the people
as good and evil 

it was ye  ye wisest ones  who put such guests in this boat  and gave
them pomp and proud names  ye and your ruling will 

onward the river now carrieth your boat  it must carry it  a small
matter if the rough wave foameth and angrily resisteth its keel 

it is not the river that is your danger and the end of your good and
evil  ye wisest ones  but that will itself  the will to power  the
unexhausted  procreating life will 

but that ye may understand my gospel of good and evil  for that purpose
will i tell you my gospel of life  and of the nature of all living
things 

the living thing did i follow  i walked in the broadest and narrowest
paths to learn its nature 

with a hundred faced mirror did i catch its glance when its mouth was
shut  so that its eye might speak unto me  and its eye spake unto me 

but wherever i found living things  there heard i also the language of
obedience  all living things are obeying things 

and this heard i secondly  whatever cannot obey itself  is commanded 
such is the nature of living things 

this  however  is the third thing which i heard  namely  that commanding
is more difficult than obeying  and not only because the commander
beareth the burden of all obeyers  and because this burden readily
crusheth him   

an attempt and a risk seemed all commanding unto me  and whenever it
commandeth  the living thing risketh itself thereby 

yea  even when it commandeth itself  then also must it atone for its
commanding  of its own law must it become the judge and avenger and
victim 

how doth this happen  so did i ask myself  what persuadeth the living
thing to obey  and command  and even be obedient in commanding 

hearken now unto my word  ye wisest ones  test it seriously  whether
i have crept into the heart of life itself  and into the roots of its
heart 

wherever i found a living thing  there found i will to power  and even
in the will of the servant found i the will to be master 

that to the stronger the weaker shall serve  thereto persuadeth he his
will who would be master over a still weaker one  that delight alone he
is unwilling to forego 

and as the lesser surrendereth himself to the greater that he may have
delight and power over the least of all  so doth even the greatest
surrender himself  and staketh  life  for the sake of power 

it is the surrender of the greatest to run risk and danger  and play
dice for death 

and where there is sacrifice and service and love glances  there also
is the will to be master  by by ways doth the weaker then slink into
the fortress  and into the heart of the mightier one  and there stealeth
power 

and this secret spake life herself unto me   behold   said she   i am
that which must ever surpass itself 

to be sure  ye call it will to procreation  or impulse towards a goal 
towards the higher  remoter  more manifold  but all that is one and the
same secret 

rather would i succumb than disown this one thing  and verily  where
there is succumbing and leaf falling  lo  there doth life sacrifice
itself  for power 

that i have to be struggle  and becoming  and purpose  and
cross purpose  ah  he who divineth my will  divineth well also on what
crooked paths it hath to tread 

whatever i create  and however much i love it   soon must i be adverse
to it  and to my love  so willeth my will 

and even thou  discerning one  art only a path and footstep of my will 
verily  my will to power walketh even on the feet of thy will to truth 

he certainly did not hit the truth who shot at it the formula   will to
existence   that will  doth not exist 

for what is not  cannot will  that  however  which is in existence  how
could it still strive for existence 

only where there is life  is there also will  not  however  will to
life  but  so teach i thee  will to power 

much is reckoned higher than life itself by the living one  but out of
the very reckoning speaketh  the will to power    

thus did life once teach me  and thereby  ye wisest ones  do i solve you
the riddle of your hearts 

verily  i say unto you  good and evil which would be everlasting  it
doth not exist  of its own accord must it ever surpass itself anew 

with your values and formulae of good and evil  ye exercise power 
ye valuing ones  and that is your secret love  and the sparkling 
trembling  and overflowing of your souls 

but a stronger power groweth out of your values  and a new surpassing 
by it breaketh egg and egg shell 

and he who hath to be a creator in good and evil  verily  he hath first
to be a destroyer  and break values in pieces 

thus doth the greatest evil pertain to the greatest good  that  however 
is the creating good   

let us speak thereof  ye wisest ones  even though it be bad  to be
silent is worse  all suppressed truths become poisonous 

and let everything break up which  can break up by our truths  many a
house is still to be built   

thus spake zarathustra 




xxxv  the sublime ones 

calm is the bottom of my sea  who would guess that it hideth droll
monsters 

unmoved is my depth  but it sparkleth with swimming enigmas and
laughters 

a sublime one saw i to day  a solemn one  a penitent of the spirit  oh 
how my soul laughed at his ugliness 

with upraised breast  and like those who draw in their breath  thus did
he stand  the sublime one  and in silence 

o erhung with ugly truths  the spoil of his hunting  and rich in torn
raiment  many thorns also hung on him  but i saw no rose 

not yet had he learned laughing and beauty  gloomy did this hunter
return from the forest of knowledge 

from the fight with wild beasts returned he home  but even yet a wild
beast gazeth out of his seriousness  an unconquered wild beast 

as a tiger doth he ever stand  on the point of springing  but i do not
like those strained souls  ungracious is my taste towards all those
self engrossed ones 

and ye tell me  friends  that there is to be no dispute about taste and
tasting  but all life is a dispute about taste and tasting 

taste  that is weight at the same time  and scales and weigher  and alas
for every living thing that would live without dispute about weight and
scales and weigher 

should he become weary of his sublimeness  this sublime one  then only
will his beauty begin  and then only will i taste him and find him
savoury 

and only when he turneth away from himself will he o erleap his own
shadow  and verily  into his sun 

far too long did he sit in the shade  the cheeks of the penitent of the
spirit became pale  he almost starved on his expectations 

contempt is still in his eye  and loathing hideth in his mouth  to be
sure  he now resteth  but he hath not yet taken rest in the sunshine 

as the ox ought he to do  and his happiness should smell of the earth 
and not of contempt for the earth 

as a white ox would i like to see him  which  snorting and lowing 
walketh before the plough share  and his lowing should also laud all
that is earthly 

dark is still his countenance  the shadow of his hand danceth upon it 
o ershadowed is still the sense of his eye 

his deed itself is still the shadow upon him  his doing obscureth the
doer  not yet hath he overcome his deed 

to be sure  i love in him the shoulders of the ox  but now do i want to
see also the eye of the angel 

also his hero will hath he still to unlearn  an exalted one shall he
be  and not only a sublime one   the ether itself should raise him  the
will less one 

he hath subdued monsters  he hath solved enigmas  but he should also
redeem his monsters and enigmas  into heavenly children should he
transform them 

as yet hath his knowledge not learned to smile  and to be without
jealousy  as yet hath his gushing passion not become calm in beauty 

verily  not in satiety shall his longing cease and disappear  but in
beauty  gracefulness belongeth to the munificence of the magnanimous 

his arm across his head  thus should the hero repose  thus should he
also surmount his repose 

but precisely to the hero is beauty the hardest thing of all 
unattainable is beauty by all ardent wills 

a little more  a little less  precisely this is much here  it is the
most here 

to stand with relaxed muscles and with unharnessed will  that is the
hardest for all of you  ye sublime ones 

when power becometh gracious and descendeth into the visible  i call
such condescension  beauty 

and from no one do i want beauty so much as from thee  thou powerful
one  let thy goodness be thy last self conquest 

all evil do i accredit to thee  therefore do i desire of thee the good 

verily  i have often laughed at the weaklings  who think themselves good
because they have crippled paws 

the virtue of the pillar shalt thou strive after  more beautiful doth
it ever become  and more graceful  but internally harder and more
sustaining  the higher it riseth 

yea  thou sublime one  one day shalt thou also be beautiful  and hold up
the mirror to thine own beauty 

then will thy soul thrill with divine desires  and there will be
adoration even in thy vanity 

for this is the secret of the soul  when the hero hath abandoned it 
then only approacheth it in dreams  the superhero   

thus spake zarathustra 




xxxvi  the land of culture 

too far did i fly into the future  a horror seized upon me 

and when i looked around me  lo  there time was my sole contemporary 

then did i fly backwards  homewards  and always faster  thus did i come
unto you  ye present day men  and into the land of culture 

for the first time brought i an eye to see you  and good desire  verily 
with longing in my heart did i come 

but how did it turn out with me  although so alarmed  i had yet to
laugh  never did mine eye see anything so motley coloured 

i laughed and laughed  while my foot still trembled  and my heart as
well   here forsooth  is the home of all the paintpots    said i 

with fifty patches painted on faces and limbs  so sat ye there to mine
astonishment  ye present day men 

and with fifty mirrors around you  which flattered your play of colours 
and repeated it 

verily  ye could wear no better masks  ye present day men  than your own
faces  who could  recognise you 

written all over with the characters of the past  and these characters
also pencilled over with new characters  thus have ye concealed
yourselves well from all decipherers 

and though one be a trier of the reins  who still believeth that ye have
reins  out of colours ye seem to be baked  and out of glued scraps 

all times and peoples gaze divers coloured out of your veils  all
customs and beliefs speak divers coloured out of your gestures 

he who would strip you of veils and wrappers  and paints and gestures 
would just have enough left to scare the crows 

verily  i myself am the scared crow that once saw you naked  and without
paint  and i flew away when the skeleton ogled at me 

rather would i be a day labourer in the nether world  and among the
shades of the by gone   fatter and fuller than ye  are forsooth the
nether worldlings 

this  yea this  is bitterness to my bowels  that i can neither endure
you naked nor clothed  ye present day men 

all that is unhomelike in the future  and whatever maketh strayed birds
shiver  is verily more homelike and familiar than your  reality  

for thus speak ye   real are we wholly  and without faith and
superstition   thus do ye plume yourselves  alas  even without plumes 

indeed  how would ye be able to believe  ye divers coloured ones   ye
who are pictures of all that hath ever been believed 

perambulating refutations are ye  of belief itself  and a dislocation of
all thought  untrustworthy ones  thus do  i  call you  ye real ones 

all periods prate against one another in your spirits  and the dreams
and pratings of all periods were even realer than your awakeness 

unfruitful are ye  therefore do ye lack belief  but he who had to
create  had always his presaging dreams and astral premonitions  and
believed in believing   

half open doors are ye  at which grave diggers wait  and this is your
reality   everything deserveth to perish  

alas  how ye stand there before me  ye unfruitful ones  how lean your
ribs  and many of you surely have had knowledge thereof 

many a one hath said   there hath surely a god filched something from
me secretly whilst i slept  verily  enough to make a girl for himself
therefrom 

 amazing is the poverty of my ribs   thus hath spoken many a present day
man 

yea  ye are laughable unto me  ye present day men  and especially when
ye marvel at yourselves 

and woe unto me if i could not laugh at your marvelling  and had to
swallow all that is repugnant in your platters 

as it is  however  i will make lighter of you  since i have to carry
what is heavy  and what matter if beetles and may bugs also alight on my
load 

verily  it shall not on that account become heavier to me  and not from
you  ye present day men  shall my great weariness arise   

ah  whither shall i now ascend with my longing  from all mountains do i
look out for fatherlands and motherlands 

but a home have i found nowhere  unsettled am i in all cities  and
decamping at all gates 

alien to me  and a mockery  are the present day men  to whom of late my
heart impelled me  and exiled am i from fatherlands and motherlands 

thus do i love only my children s land  the undiscovered in the remotest
sea  for it do i bid my sails search and search 

unto my children will i make amends for being the child of my fathers 
and unto all the future  for this present day   

thus spake zarathustra 




xxxvii  immaculate perception 

when yester eve the moon arose  then did i fancy it about to bear a sun 
so broad and teeming did it lie on the horizon 

but it was a liar with its pregnancy  and sooner will i believe in the
man in the moon than in the woman 

to be sure  little of a man is he also  that timid night reveller 
verily  with a bad conscience doth he stalk over the roofs 

for he is covetous and jealous  the monk in the moon  covetous of the
earth  and all the joys of lovers 

nay  i like him not  that tom cat on the roofs  hateful unto me are all
that slink around half closed windows 

piously and silently doth he stalk along on the star carpets   but i
like no light treading human feet  on which not even a spur jingleth 

every honest one s step speaketh  the cat however  stealeth along over
the ground  lo  cat like doth the moon come along  and dishonestly   

this parable speak i unto you sentimental dissemblers  unto you  the
 pure discerners   you do  i  call  covetous ones 

also ye love the earth  and the earthly  i have divined you well   but
shame is in your love  and a bad conscience  ye are like the moon 

to despise the earthly hath your spirit been persuaded  but not your
bowels  these  however  are the strongest in you 

and now is your spirit ashamed to be at the service of your bowels  and
goeth by ways and lying ways to escape its own shame 

 that would be the highest thing for me   so saith your lying spirit
unto itself   to gaze upon life without desire  and not like the dog 
with hanging out tongue 

to be happy in gazing  with dead will  free from the grip and greed
of selfishness  cold and ashy grey all over  but with intoxicated
moon eyes 

that would be the dearest thing to me   thus doth the seduced one seduce
himself    to love the earth as the moon loveth it  and with the eye
only to feel its beauty 

and this do i call immaculate perception of all things  to want nothing
else from them  but to be allowed to lie before them as a mirror with a
hundred facets    

oh  ye sentimental dissemblers  ye covetous ones  ye lack innocence in
your desire  and now do ye defame desiring on that account 

verily  not as creators  as procreators  or as jubilators do ye love the
earth 

where is innocence  where there is will to procreation  and he who
seeketh to create beyond himself  hath for me the purest will 

where is beauty  where i must will with my whole will  where i will love
and perish  that an image may not remain merely an image 

loving and perishing  these have rhymed from eternity  will to love 
that is to be ready also for death  thus do i speak unto you cowards 

but now doth your emasculated ogling profess to be  contemplation  
 and that which can be examined with cowardly eyes is to be christened
 beautiful   oh  ye violators of noble names 

but it shall be your curse  ye immaculate ones  ye pure discerners  that
ye shall never bring forth  even though ye lie broad and teeming on the
horizon 

verily  ye fill your mouth with noble words  and we are to believe that
your heart overfloweth  ye cozeners 

but my words are poor  contemptible  stammering words  gladly do i pick
up what falleth from the table at your repasts 

yet still can i say therewith the truth  to dissemblers  yea  my
fish bones  shells  and prickly leaves shall  tickle the noses of
dissemblers 

bad air is always about you and your repasts  your lascivious thoughts 
your lies  and secrets are indeed in the air 

dare only to believe in yourselves  in yourselves and in your inward
parts  he who doth not believe in himself always lieth 

a god s mask have ye hung in front of you  ye  pure ones   into a god s
mask hath your execrable coiling snake crawled 

verily ye deceive  ye  contemplative ones   even zarathustra was once
the dupe of your godlike exterior  he did not divine the serpent s coil
with which it was stuffed 

a god s soul  i once thought i saw playing in your games  ye pure
discerners  no better arts did i once dream of than your arts 

serpents  filth and evil odour  the distance concealed from me  and that
a lizard s craft prowled thereabouts lasciviously 

but i came nigh unto you  then came to me the day   and now cometh it to
you   at an end is the moon s love affair 

see there  surprised and pale doth it stand  before the rosy dawn 

for already she cometh  the glowing one   her love to the earth cometh 
innocence and creative desire  is all solar love 

see there  how she cometh impatiently over the sea  do ye not feel the
thirst and the hot breath of her love 

at the sea would she suck  and drink its depths to her height  now
riseth the desire of the sea with its thousand breasts 

kissed and sucked would it be by the thirst of the sun  vapour would it
become  and height  and path of light  and light itself 

verily  like the sun do i love life  and all deep seas 

and this meaneth to me knowledge  all that is deep shall ascend  to my
height   

thus spake zarathustra 




xxxviii  scholars 

when i lay asleep  then did a sheep eat at the ivy wreath on my
head   it ate  and said thereby   zarathustra is no longer a scholar  

it said this  and went away clumsily and proudly  a child told it to me 

i like to lie here where the children play  beside the ruined wall 
among thistles and red poppies 

a scholar am i still to the children  and also to the thistles and red
poppies  innocent are they  even in their wickedness 

but to the sheep i am no longer a scholar  so willeth my lot  blessings
upon it 

for this is the truth  i have departed from the house of the scholars 
and the door have i also slammed behind me 

too long did my soul sit hungry at their table  not like them have i got
the knack of investigating  as the knack of nut cracking 

freedom do i love  and the air over fresh soil  rather would i sleep on
ox skins than on their honours and dignities 

i am too hot and scorched with mine own thought  often is it ready to
take away my breath  then have i to go into the open air  and away from
all dusty rooms 

but they sit cool in the cool shade  they want in everything to be
merely spectators  and they avoid sitting where the sun burneth on the
steps 

like those who stand in the street and gape at the passers by  thus do
they also wait  and gape at the thoughts which others have thought 

should one lay hold of them  then do they raise a dust like flour sacks 
and involuntarily  but who would divine that their dust came from corn 
and from the yellow delight of the summer fields 

when they give themselves out as wise  then do their petty sayings and
truths chill me  in their wisdom there is often an odour as if it came
from the swamp  and verily  i have even heard the frog croak in it 

clever are they  they have dexterous fingers  what doth my simplicity
pretend to beside their multiplicity  all threading and knitting and
weaving do their fingers understand  thus do they make the hose of the
spirit 

good clockworks are they  only be careful to wind them up properly 
then do they indicate the hour without mistake  and make a modest noise
thereby 

like millstones do they work  and like pestles  throw only seed corn
unto them   they know well how to grind corn small  and make white dust
out of it 

they keep a sharp eye on one another  and do not trust each other the
best  ingenious in little artifices  they wait for those whose knowledge
walketh on lame feet   like spiders do they wait 

i saw them always prepare their poison with precaution  and always did
they put glass gloves on their fingers in doing so 

they also know how to play with false dice  and so eagerly did i find
them playing  that they perspired thereby 

we are alien to each other  and their virtues are even more repugnant to
my taste than their falsehoods and false dice 

and when i lived with them  then did i live above them  therefore did
they take a dislike to me 

they want to hear nothing of any one walking above their heads  and so
they put wood and earth and rubbish betwixt me and their heads 

thus did they deafen the sound of my tread  and least have i hitherto
been heard by the most learned 

all mankind s faults and weaknesses did they put betwixt themselves and
me   they call it  false ceiling  in their houses 

but nevertheless i walk with my thoughts above their heads  and even
should i walk on mine own errors  still would i be above them and their
heads 

for men are not equal  so speaketh justice  and what i will  they may
not will   

thus spake zarathustra 




xxxix  poets 

 since i have known the body better   said zarathustra to one of his
disciples   the spirit hath only been to me symbolically spirit  and all
the  imperishable   that is also but a simile  

 so have i heard thee say once before   answered the disciple   and then
thou addedst   but the poets lie too much   why didst thou say that the
poets lie too much  

 why   said zarathustra   thou askest why  i do not belong to those who
may be asked after their why 

is my experience but of yesterday  it is long ago that i experienced the
reasons for mine opinions 

should i not have to be a cask of memory  if i also wanted to have my
reasons with me 

it is already too much for me even to retain mine opinions  and many a
bird flieth away 

and sometimes  also  do i find a fugitive creature in my dovecote  which
is alien to me  and trembleth when i lay my hand upon it 

but what did zarathustra once say unto thee  that the poets lie too
much   but zarathustra also is a poet 

believest thou that he there spake the truth  why dost thou believe it  

the disciple answered   i believe in zarathustra   but zarathustra shook
his head and smiled   

belief doth not sanctify me  said he  least of all the belief in myself 

but granting that some one did say in all seriousness that the poets lie
too much  he was right  we do lie too much 

we also know too little  and are bad learners  so we are obliged to lie 

and which of us poets hath not adulterated his wine  many a poisonous
hotchpotch hath evolved in our cellars  many an indescribable thing hath
there been done 

and because we know little  therefore are we pleased from the heart with
the poor in spirit  especially when they are young women 

and even of those things are we desirous  which old women tell one
another in the evening  this do we call the eternally feminine in us 

and as if there were a special secret access to knowledge  which choketh
up for those who learn anything  so do we believe in the people and in
their  wisdom  

this  however  do all poets believe  that whoever pricketh up his ears
when lying in the grass or on lonely slopes  learneth something of the
things that are betwixt heaven and earth 

and if there come unto them tender emotions  then do the poets always
think that nature herself is in love with them 

and that she stealeth to their ear to whisper secrets into it  and
amorous flatteries  of this do they plume and pride themselves  before
all mortals 

ah  there are so many things betwixt heaven and earth of which only the
poets have dreamed 

and especially above the heavens  for all gods are poet symbolisations 
poet sophistications 

verily  ever are we drawn aloft  that is  to the realm of the clouds 
on these do we set our gaudy puppets  and then call them gods and
supermen   

are not they light enough for those chairs   all these gods and
supermen   

ah  how i am weary of all the inadequate that is insisted on as actual 
ah  how i am weary of the poets 

when zarathustra so spake  his disciple resented it  but was silent  and
zarathustra also was silent  and his eye directed itself inwardly  as if
it gazed into the far distance  at last he sighed and drew breath   

i am of to day and heretofore  said he thereupon  but something is in me
that is of the morrow  and the day following  and the hereafter 

i became weary of the poets  of the old and of the new  superficial are
they all unto me  and shallow seas 

they did not think sufficiently into the depth  therefore their feeling
did not reach to the bottom 

some sensation of voluptuousness and some sensation of tedium  these
have as yet been their best contemplation 

ghost breathing and ghost whisking  seemeth to me all the
jingle jangling of their harps  what have they known hitherto of the
fervour of tones   

they are also not pure enough for me  they all muddle their water that
it may seem deep 

and fain would they thereby prove themselves reconcilers  but mediaries
and mixers are they unto me  and half and half  and impure   

ah  i cast indeed my net into their sea  and meant to catch good fish 
but always did i draw up the head of some ancient god 

thus did the sea give a stone to the hungry one  and they themselves may
well originate from the sea 

certainly  one findeth pearls in them  thereby they are the more like
hard molluscs  and instead of a soul  i have often found in them salt
slime 

they have learned from the sea also its vanity  is not the sea the
peacock of peacocks 

even before the ugliest of all buffaloes doth it spread out its tail 
never doth it tire of its lace fan of silver and silk 

disdainfully doth the buffalo glance thereat  nigh to the sand with its
soul  nigher still to the thicket  nighest  however  to the swamp 

what is beauty and sea and peacock splendour to it  this parable i speak
unto the poets 

verily  their spirit itself is the peacock of peacocks  and a sea of
vanity 

spectators  seeketh the spirit of the poet  should they even be
buffaloes   

but of this spirit became i weary  and i see the time coming when it
will become weary of itself 

yea  changed have i seen the poets  and their glance turned towards
themselves 

penitents of the spirit have i seen appearing  they grew out of the
poets   

thus spake zarathustra 




xl  great events 

there is an isle in the sea  not far from the happy isles of
zarathustra  on which a volcano ever smoketh  of which isle the people 
and especially the old women amongst them  say that it is placed as a
rock before the gate of the nether world  but that through the volcano
itself the narrow way leadeth downwards which conducteth to this gate 

now about the time that zarathustra sojourned on the happy isles  it
happened that a ship anchored at the isle on which standeth the smoking
mountain  and the crew went ashore to shoot rabbits  about the noontide
hour  however  when the captain and his men were together again  they
saw suddenly a man coming towards them through the air  and a voice said
distinctly   it is time  it is the highest time   but when the figure
was nearest to them  it flew past quickly  however  like a shadow  in
the direction of the volcano   then did they recognise with the greatest
surprise that it was zarathustra  for they had all seen him before
except the captain himself  and they loved him as the people love  in
such wise that love and awe were combined in equal degree 

 behold   said the old helmsman   there goeth zarathustra to hell  

about the same time that these sailors landed on the fire isle  there
was a rumour that zarathustra had disappeared  and when his friends were
asked about it  they said that he had gone on board a ship by night 
without saying whither he was going 

thus there arose some uneasiness  after three days  however  there came
the story of the ship s crew in addition to this uneasiness  and
then did all the people say that the devil had taken zarathustra  his
disciples laughed  sure enough  at this talk  and one of them said even 
 sooner would i believe that zarathustra hath taken the devil   but at
the bottom of their hearts they were all full of anxiety and longing  so
their joy was great when on the fifth day zarathustra appeared amongst
them 

and this is the account of zarathustra s interview with the fire dog 

the earth  said he  hath a skin  and this skin hath diseases  one of
these diseases  for example  is called  man  

and another of these diseases is called  the fire dog   concerning him
men have greatly deceived themselves  and let themselves be deceived 

to fathom this mystery did i go o er the sea  and i have seen the truth
naked  verily  barefooted up to the neck 

now do i know how it is concerning the fire dog  and likewise concerning
all the spouting and subversive devils  of which not only old women are
afraid 

 up with thee  fire dog  out of thy depth   cried i   and confess how
deep that depth is  whence cometh that which thou snortest up 

thou drinkest copiously at the sea  that doth thine embittered eloquence
betray  in sooth  for a dog of the depth  thou takest thy nourishment
too much from the surface 

at the most  i regard thee as the ventriloquist of the earth  and ever 
when i have heard subversive and spouting devils speak  i have found
them like thee  embittered  mendacious  and shallow 

ye understand how to roar and obscure with ashes  ye are the best
braggarts  and have sufficiently learned the art of making dregs boil 

where ye are  there must always be dregs at hand  and much that is
spongy  hollow  and compressed  it wanteth to have freedom 

 freedom  ye all roar most eagerly  but i have unlearned the belief in
 great events   when there is much roaring and smoke about them 

and believe me  friend hullabaloo  the greatest events  are not our
noisiest  but our stillest hours 

not around the inventors of new noise  but around the inventors of new
values  doth the world revolve  inaudibly it revolveth 

and just own to it  little had ever taken place when thy noise and smoke
passed away  what  if a city did become a mummy  and a statue lay in the
mud 

and this do i say also to the o erthrowers of statues  it is certainly
the greatest folly to throw salt into the sea  and statues into the mud 

in the mud of your contempt lay the statue  but it is just its law  that
out of contempt  its life and living beauty grow again 

with diviner features doth it now arise  seducing by its suffering  and
verily  it will yet thank you for o erthrowing it  ye subverters 

this counsel  however  do i counsel to kings and churches  and to all
that is weak with age or virtue  let yourselves be o erthrown  that ye
may again come to life  and that virtue  may come to you    

thus spake i before the fire dog  then did he interrupt me sullenly  and
asked   church  what is that  

 church   answered i   that is a kind of state  and indeed the most
mendacious  but remain quiet  thou dissembling dog  thou surely knowest
thine own species best 

like thyself the state is a dissembling dog  like thee doth it like
to speak with smoke and roaring  to make believe  like thee  that it
speaketh out of the heart of things 

for it seeketh by all means to be the most important creature on earth 
the state  and people think it so  

when i had said this  the fire dog acted as if mad with envy   what  
 cried he   the most important creature on earth  and people think it
so   and so much vapour and terrible voices came out of his throat  that
i thought he would choke with vexation and envy 

at last he became calmer and his panting subsided  as soon  however  as
he was quiet  i said laughingly 

 thou art angry  fire dog  so i am in the right about thee 

and that i may also maintain the right  hear the story of another
fire dog  he speaketh actually out of the heart of the earth 

gold doth his breath exhale  and golden rain  so doth his heart desire 
what are ashes and smoke and hot dregs to him 

laughter flitteth from him like a variegated cloud  adverse is he to thy
gargling and spewing and grips in the bowels 

the gold  however  and the laughter  these doth he take out of the heart
of the earth  for  that thou mayst know it   the heart of the earth is
of gold  

when the fire dog heard this  he could no longer endure to listen to me 
abashed did he draw in his tail  said  bow wow   in a cowed voice  and
crept down into his cave   

thus told zarathustra  his disciples  however  hardly listened to him 
so great was their eagerness to tell him about the sailors  the rabbits 
and the flying man 

 what am i to think of it   said zarathustra   am i indeed a ghost 

but it may have been my shadow  ye have surely heard something of the
wanderer and his shadow 

one thing  however  is certain  i must keep a tighter hold of it 
otherwise it will spoil my reputation  

and once more zarathustra shook his head and wondered   what am i to
think of it   said he once more 

 why did the ghost cry   it is time  it is the highest time  

for what is it then  the highest time    

thus spake zarathustra 




xli  the soothsayer 

  and i saw a great sadness come over mankind  the best turned weary of
their works 

a doctrine appeared  a faith ran beside it   all is empty  all is alike 
all hath been  

and from all hills there re echoed   all is empty  all is alike  all
hath been  

to be sure we have harvested  but why have all our fruits become rotten
and brown  what was it fell last night from the evil moon 

in vain was all our labour  poison hath our wine become  the evil eye
hath singed yellow our fields and hearts 

arid have we all become  and fire falling upon us  then do we turn dust
like ashes   yea  the fire itself have we made aweary 

all our fountains have dried up  even the sea hath receded  all the
ground trieth to gape  but the depth will not swallow 

 alas  where is there still a sea in which one could be drowned   so
soundeth our plaint  across shallow swamps 

verily  even for dying have we become too weary  now do we keep awake
and live on  in sepulchres  

thus did zarathustra hear a soothsayer speak  and the foreboding touched
his heart and transformed him  sorrowfully did he go about and wearily 
and he became like unto those of whom the soothsayer had spoken   

verily  said he unto his disciples  a little while  and there cometh the
long twilight  alas  how shall i preserve my light through it 

that it may not smother in this sorrowfulness  to remoter worlds shall
it be a light  and also to remotest nights 

thus did zarathustra go about grieved in his heart  and for three days
he did not take any meat or drink  he had no rest  and lost his speech 
at last it came to pass that he fell into a deep sleep  his disciples 
however  sat around him in long night watches  and waited anxiously to
see if he would awake  and speak again  and recover from his affliction 

and this is the discourse that zarathustra spake when he awoke  his
voice  however  came unto his disciples as from afar 

hear  i pray you  the dream that i dreamed  my friends  and help me to
divine its meaning 

a riddle is it still unto me  this dream  the meaning is hidden in it
and encaged  and doth not yet fly above it on free pinions 

all life had i renounced  so i dreamed  night watchman and
grave guardian had i become  aloft  in the lone mountain fortress of
death 

there did i guard his coffins  full stood the musty vaults of those
trophies of victory  out of glass coffins did vanquished life gaze upon
me 

the odour of dust covered eternities did i breathe  sultry and
dust covered lay my soul  and who could have aired his soul there 

brightness of midnight was ever around me  lonesomeness cowered beside
her  and as a third  death rattle stillness  the worst of my female
friends 

keys did i carry  the rustiest of all keys  and i knew how to open with
them the most creaking of all gates 

like a bitterly angry croaking ran the sound through the long corridors
when the leaves of the gate opened  ungraciously did this bird cry 
unwillingly was it awakened 

but more frightful even  and more heart strangling was it  when it again
became silent and still all around  and i alone sat in that malignant
silence 

thus did time pass with me  and slip by  if time there still was  what
do i know thereof  but at last there happened that which awoke me 

thrice did there peal peals at the gate like thunders  thrice did the
vaults resound and howl again  then did i go to the gate 

alpa  cried i  who carrieth his ashes unto the mountain  alpa  alpa  who
carrieth his ashes unto the mountain 

and i pressed the key  and pulled at the gate  and exerted myself  but
not a finger s breadth was it yet open 

then did a roaring wind tear the folds apart  whistling  whizzing  and
piercing  it threw unto me a black coffin 

and in the roaring  and whistling  and whizzing the coffin burst up  and
spouted out a thousand peals of laughter 

and a thousand caricatures of children  angels  owls  fools  and
child sized butterflies laughed and mocked  and roared at me 

fearfully was i terrified thereby  it prostrated me  and i cried with
horror as i ne er cried before 

but mine own crying awoke me   and i came to myself   

thus did zarathustra relate his dream  and then was silent  for as yet
he knew not the interpretation thereof  but the disciple whom he loved
most arose quickly  seized zarathustra s hand  and said 

 thy life itself interpreteth unto us this dream  o zarathustra 

art thou not thyself the wind with shrill whistling  which bursteth open
the gates of the fortress of death 

art thou not thyself the coffin full of many hued malices and
angel caricatures of life 

verily  like a thousand peals of children s laughter cometh
zarathustra into all sepulchres  laughing at those night watchmen and
grave guardians  and whoever else rattleth with sinister keys 

with thy laughter wilt thou frighten and prostrate them  fainting and
recovering will demonstrate thy power over them 

and when the long twilight cometh and the mortal weariness  even then
wilt thou not disappear from our firmament  thou advocate of life 

new stars hast thou made us see  and new nocturnal glories  verily 
laughter itself hast thou spread out over us like a many hued canopy 

now will children s laughter ever from coffins flow  now will a strong
wind ever come victoriously unto all mortal weariness  of this thou art
thyself the pledge and the prophet 

verily  they themselves didst thou dream  thine enemies  that was thy
sorest dream 

but as thou awokest from them and camest to thyself  so shall they
awaken from themselves  and come unto thee  

thus spake the disciple  and all the others then thronged around
zarathustra  grasped him by the hands  and tried to persuade him to
leave his bed and his sadness  and return unto them  zarathustra 
however  sat upright on his couch  with an absent look  like one
returning from long foreign sojourn did he look on his disciples  and
examined their features  but still he knew them not  when  however  they
raised him  and set him upon his feet  behold  all on a sudden his eye
changed  he understood everything that had happened  stroked his beard 
and said with a strong voice 

 well  this hath just its time  but see to it  my disciples  that we
have a good repast  and without delay  thus do i mean to make amends for
bad dreams 

the soothsayer  however  shall eat and drink at my side  and verily  i
will yet show him a sea in which he can drown himself    

thus spake zarathustra  then did he gaze long into the face of the
disciple who had been the dream interpreter  and shook his head   




xlii  redemption 

when zarathustra went one day over the great bridge  then did the
cripples and beggars surround him  and a hunchback spake thus unto him 

 behold  zarathustra  even the people learn from thee  and acquire faith
in thy teaching  but for them to believe fully in thee  one thing is
still needful  thou must first of all convince us cripples  here hast
thou now a fine selection  and verily  an opportunity with more than one
forelock  the blind canst thou heal  and make the lame run  and from
him who hath too much behind  couldst thou well  also  take away a
little   that  i think  would be the right method to make the cripples
believe in zarathustra  

zarathustra  however  answered thus unto him who so spake  when one
taketh his hump from the hunchback  then doth one take from him his
spirit  so do the people teach  and when one giveth the blind man eyes 
then doth he see too many bad things on the earth  so that he curseth
him who healed him  he  however  who maketh the lame man run  inflicteth
upon him the greatest injury  for hardly can he run  when his vices
run away with him  so do the people teach concerning cripples  and why
should not zarathustra also learn from the people  when the people learn
from zarathustra 

it is  however  the smallest thing unto me since i have been amongst
men  to see one person lacking an eye  another an ear  and a third a
leg  and that others have lost the tongue  or the nose  or the head 

i see and have seen worse things  and divers things so hideous  that i
should neither like to speak of all matters  nor even keep silent about
some of them  namely  men who lack everything  except that they have
too much of one thing  men who are nothing more than a big eye  or a big
mouth  or a big belly  or something else big   reversed cripples  i call
such men 

and when i came out of my solitude  and for the first time passed over
this bridge  then i could not trust mine eyes  but looked again and
again  and said at last   that is an ear  an ear as big as a man   i
looked still more attentively  and actually there did move under the ear
something that was pitiably small and poor and slim  and in truth this
immense ear was perched on a small thin stalk  the stalk  however  was a
man  a person putting a glass to his eyes  could even recognise further
a small envious countenance  and also that a bloated soullet dangled at
the stalk  the people told me  however  that the big ear was not only a
man  but a great man  a genius  but i never believed in the people when
they spake of great men  and i hold to my belief that it was a reversed
cripple  who had too little of everything  and too much of one thing 

when zarathustra had spoken thus unto the hunchback  and unto those of
whom the hunchback was the mouthpiece and advocate  then did he turn to
his disciples in profound dejection  and said 

verily  my friends  i walk amongst men as amongst the fragments and
limbs of human beings 

this is the terrible thing to mine eye  that i find man broken up  and
scattered about  as on a battle  and butcher ground 

and when mine eye fleeth from the present to the bygone  it findeth ever
the same  fragments and limbs and fearful chances  but no men 

the present and the bygone upon earth  ah  my friends  that is my most
unbearable trouble  and i should not know how to live  if i were not a
seer of what is to come 

a seer  a purposer  a creator  a future itself  and a bridge to the
future  and alas  also as it were a cripple on this bridge  all that is
zarathustra 

and ye also asked yourselves often   who is zarathustra to us  what
shall he be called by us   and like me  did ye give yourselves questions
for answers 

is he a promiser  or a fulfiller  a conqueror  or an inheritor  a
harvest  or a ploughshare  a physician  or a healed one 

is he a poet  or a genuine one  an emancipator  or a subjugator  a good
one  or an evil one 

i walk amongst men as the fragments of the future  that future which i
contemplate 

and it is all my poetisation and aspiration to compose and collect into
unity what is fragment and riddle and fearful chance 

and how could i endure to be a man  if man were not also the composer 
and riddle reader  and redeemer of chance 

to redeem what is past  and to transform every  it was  into  thus would
i have it    that only do i call redemption 

will  so is the emancipator and joy bringer called  thus have i taught
you  my friends  but now learn this likewise  the will itself is still a
prisoner 

willing emancipateth  but what is that called which still putteth the
emancipator in chains 

 it was   thus is the will s teeth gnashing and lonesomest tribulation
called  impotent towards what hath been done  it is a malicious
spectator of all that is past 

not backward can the will will  that it cannot break time and time s
desire  that is the will s lonesomest tribulation 

willing emancipateth  what doth willing itself devise in order to get
free from its tribulation and mock at its prison 

ah  a fool becometh every prisoner  foolishly delivereth itself also the
imprisoned will 

that time doth not run backward  that is its animosity   that which
was   so is the stone which it cannot roll called 

and thus doth it roll stones out of animosity and ill humour  and taketh
revenge on whatever doth not  like it  feel rage and ill humour 

thus did the will  the emancipator  become a torturer  and on all
that is capable of suffering it taketh revenge  because it cannot go
backward 

this  yea  this alone is revenge itself  the will s antipathy to time 
and its  it was  

verily  a great folly dwelleth in our will  and it became a curse unto
all humanity  that this folly acquired spirit 

the spirit of revenge  my friends  that hath hitherto been man s best
contemplation  and where there was suffering  it was claimed there was
always penalty 

 penalty   so calleth itself revenge  with a lying word it feigneth a
good conscience 

and because in the willer himself there is suffering  because he cannot
will backwards  thus was willing itself  and all life  claimed  to be
penalty 

and then did cloud after cloud roll over the spirit  until at last
madness preached   everything perisheth  therefore everything deserveth
to perish  

 and this itself is justice  the law of time  that he must devour his
children   thus did madness preach 

 morally are things ordered according to justice and penalty  oh  where
is there deliverance from the flux of things and from the  existence  of
penalty   thus did madness preach 

 can there be deliverance when there is eternal justice  alas 
unrollable is the stone   it was   eternal must also be all penalties  
 thus did madness preach 

 no deed can be annihilated  how could it be undone by the penalty 
this  this is what is eternal in the  existence  of penalty  that
existence also must be eternally recurring deed and guilt 

unless the will should at last deliver itself  and willing become
non willing     but ye know  my brethren  this fabulous song of madness 

away from those fabulous songs did i lead you when i taught you   the
will is a creator  

all  it was  is a fragment  a riddle  a fearful chance  until the
creating will saith thereto   but thus would i have it    

until the creating will saith thereto   but thus do i will it  thus
shall i will it  

but did it ever speak thus  and when doth this take place  hath the will
been unharnessed from its own folly 

hath the will become its own deliverer and joy bringer  hath it
unlearned the spirit of revenge and all teeth gnashing 

and who hath taught it reconciliation with time  and something higher
than all reconciliation 

something higher than all reconciliation must the will will which is the
will to power    but how doth that take place  who hath taught it also
to will backwards 

  but at this point in his discourse it chanced that zarathustra
suddenly paused  and looked like a person in the greatest alarm  with
terror in his eyes did he gaze on his disciples  his glances pierced as
with arrows their thoughts and arrear thoughts  but after a brief space
he again laughed  and said soothedly 

 it is difficult to live amongst men  because silence is so difficult  
especially for a babbler    

thus spake zarathustra  the hunchback  however  had listened to the
conversation and had covered his face during the time  but when he heard
zarathustra laugh  he looked up with curiosity  and said slowly 

 but why doth zarathustra speak otherwise unto us than unto his
disciples  

zarathustra answered   what is there to be wondered at  with hunchbacks
one may well speak in a hunchbacked way  

 very good   said the hunchback   and with pupils one may well tell
tales out of school 

but why doth zarathustra speak otherwise unto his pupils  than unto
himself    




xliii  manly prudence 

not the height  it is the declivity that is terrible 

the declivity  where the gaze shooteth downwards  and the hand graspeth
upwards  there doth the heart become giddy through its double will 

ah  friends  do ye divine also my heart s double will 

this  this is my declivity and my danger  that my gaze shooteth towards
the summit  and my hand would fain clutch and lean  on the depth 

to man clingeth my will  with chains do i bind myself to man  because
i am pulled upwards to the superman  for thither doth mine other will
tend 

and therefore do i live blindly among men  as if i knew them not  that
my hand may not entirely lose belief in firmness 

i know not you men  this gloom and consolation is often spread around
me 

i sit at the gateway for every rogue  and ask  who wisheth to deceive
me 

this is my first manly prudence  that i allow myself to be deceived  so
as not to be on my guard against deceivers 

ah  if i were on my guard against man  how could man be an anchor to my
ball  too easily would i be pulled upwards and away 

this providence is over my fate  that i have to be without foresight 

and he who would not languish amongst men  must learn to drink out of
all glasses  and he who would keep clean amongst men  must know how to
wash himself even with dirty water 

and thus spake i often to myself for consolation   courage  cheer up 
old heart  an unhappiness hath failed to befall thee  enjoy that as
thy  happiness  

this  however  is mine other manly prudence  i am more forbearing to the
vain than to the proud 

is not wounded vanity the mother of all tragedies  where  however  pride
is wounded  there there groweth up something better than pride 

that life may be fair to behold  its game must be well played  for that
purpose  however  it needeth good actors 

good actors have i found all the vain ones  they play  and wish people
to be fond of beholding them  all their spirit is in this wish 

they represent themselves  they invent themselves  in their
neighbourhood i like to look upon life  it cureth of melancholy 

therefore am i forbearing to the vain  because they are the physicians
of my melancholy  and keep me attached to man as to a drama 

and further  who conceiveth the full depth of the modesty of the vain
man  i am favourable to him  and sympathetic on account of his modesty 

from you would he learn his belief in himself  he feedeth upon your
glances  he eateth praise out of your hands 

your lies doth he even believe when you lie favourably about him  for in
its depths sigheth his heart   what am  i   

and if that be the true virtue which is unconscious of itself  well  the
vain man is unconscious of his modesty   

this is  however  my third manly prudence  i am not put out of conceit
with the wicked by your timorousness 

i am happy to see the marvels the warm sun hatcheth  tigers and palms
and rattle snakes 

also amongst men there is a beautiful brood of the warm sun  and much
that is marvellous in the wicked 

in truth  as your wisest did not seem to me so very wise  so found i
also human wickedness below the fame of it 

and oft did i ask with a shake of the head  why still rattle  ye
rattle snakes 

verily  there is still a future even for evil  and the warmest south is
still undiscovered by man 

how many things are now called the worst wickedness  which are only
twelve feet broad and three months long  some day  however  will greater
dragons come into the world 

for that the superman may not lack his dragon  the superdragon that
is worthy of him  there must still much warm sun glow on moist virgin
forests 

out of your wild cats must tigers have evolved  and out of your
poison toads  crocodiles  for the good hunter shall have a good hunt 

and verily  ye good and just  in you there is much to be laughed at  and
especially your fear of what hath hitherto been called  the devil  

so alien are ye in your souls to what is great  that to you the superman
would be frightful in his goodness 

and ye wise and knowing ones  ye would flee from the solar glow of the
wisdom in which the superman joyfully batheth his nakedness 

ye highest men who have come within my ken  this is my doubt of you  and
my secret laughter  i suspect ye would call my superman  a devil 

ah  i became tired of those highest and best ones  from their  height 
 did i long to be up  out  and away to the superman 

a horror came over me when i saw those best ones naked  then there grew
for me the pinions to soar away into distant futures 

into more distant futures  into more southern souths than ever artist
dreamed of  thither  where gods are ashamed of all clothes 

but disguised do i want to see you  ye neighbours and fellowmen  and
well attired and vain and estimable  as  the good and just    

and disguised will i myself sit amongst you  that i may mistake you and
myself  for that is my last manly prudence   

thus spake zarathustra 




xliv  the stillest hour 

what hath happened unto me  my friends  ye see me troubled  driven
forth  unwillingly obedient  ready to go  alas  to go away from you 

yea  once more must zarathustra retire to his solitude  but unjoyously
this time doth the bear go back to his cave 

what hath happened unto me  who ordereth this   ah  mine angry mistress
wisheth it so  she spake unto me  have i ever named her name to you 

yesterday towards evening there spake unto me my stillest hour  that is
the name of my terrible mistress 

and thus did it happen  for everything must i tell you  that your heart
may not harden against the suddenly departing one 

do ye know the terror of him who falleth asleep   

to the very toes he is terrified  because the ground giveth way under
him  and the dream beginneth 

this do i speak unto you in parable  yesterday at the stillest hour did
the ground give way under me  the dream began 

the hour hand moved on  the timepiece of my life drew breath  never did
i hear such stillness around me  so that my heart was terrified 

then was there spoken unto me without voice   thou knowest it 
zarathustra    

and i cried in terror at this whispering  and the blood left my face 
but i was silent 

then was there once more spoken unto me without voice   thou knowest it 
zarathustra  but thou dost not speak it    

and at last i answered  like one defiant   yea  i know it  but i will
not speak it  

then was there again spoken unto me without voice   thou wilt not 
zarathustra  is this true  conceal thyself not behind thy defiance    

and i wept and trembled like a child  and said   ah  i would indeed  but
how can i do it  exempt me only from this  it is beyond my power  

then was there again spoken unto me without voice   what matter about
thyself  zarathustra  speak thy word  and succumb  

and i answered   ah  is it my word  who am  i   i await the worthier
one  i am not worthy even to succumb by it  

then was there again spoken unto me without voice   what matter about
thyself  thou art not yet humble enough for me  humility hath the
hardest skin    

and i answered   what hath not the skin of my humility endured  at the
foot of my height do i dwell  how high are my summits  no one hath yet
told me  but well do i know my valleys  

then was there again spoken unto me without voice   o zarathustra  he
who hath to remove mountains removeth also valleys and plains    

and i answered   as yet hath my word not removed mountains  and what i
have spoken hath not reached man  i went  indeed  unto men  but not yet
have i attained unto them  

then was there again spoken unto me without voice   what knowest thou
thereof  the dew falleth on the grass when the night is most silent    

and i answered   they mocked me when i found and walked in mine own
path  and certainly did my feet then tremble 

and thus did they speak unto me  thou forgottest the path before  now
dost thou also forget how to walk  

then was there again spoken unto me without voice   what matter about
their mockery  thou art one who hast unlearned to obey  now shalt thou
command 

knowest thou not who is most needed by all  he who commandeth great
things 

to execute great things is difficult  but the more difficult task is to
command great things 

this is thy most unpardonable obstinacy  thou hast the power  and thou
wilt not rule    

and i answered   i lack the lion s voice for all commanding  

then was there again spoken unto me as a whispering   it is the stillest
words which bring the storm  thoughts that come with doves  footsteps
guide the world 

o zarathustra  thou shalt go as a shadow of that which is to come  thus
wilt thou command  and in commanding go foremost    

and i answered   i am ashamed  

then was there again spoken unto me without voice   thou must yet become
a child  and be without shame 

the pride of youth is still upon thee  late hast thou become young  but
he who would become a child must surmount even his youth    

and i considered a long while  and trembled  at last  however  did i say
what i had said at first   i will not  

then did a laughing take place all around me  alas  how that laughing
lacerated my bowels and cut into my heart 

and there was spoken unto me for the last time   o zarathustra  thy
fruits are ripe  but thou art not ripe for thy fruits 

so must thou go again into solitude  for thou shalt yet become
mellow    

and again was there a laughing  and it fled  then did it become still
around me  as with a double stillness  i lay  however  on the ground 
and the sweat flowed from my limbs 

  now have ye heard all  and why i have to return into my solitude 
nothing have i kept hidden from you  my friends 

but even this have ye heard from me  who is still the most reserved of
men  and will be so 

ah  my friends  i should have something more to say unto you  i should
have something more to give unto you  why do i not give it  am i then a
niggard   

when  however  zarathustra had spoken these words  the violence of his
pain  and a sense of the nearness of his departure from his friends came
over him  so that he wept aloud  and no one knew how to console him  in
the night  however  he went away alone and left his friends 





third part 

 ye look aloft when ye long for exaltation  and i look downward because
i am exalted 

 who among you can at the same time laugh and be exalted 

 he who climbeth on the highest mountains  laugheth at all tragic plays
and tragic realities    zarathustra  i    reading and writing  




xlv  the wanderer 

then  when it was about midnight  zarathustra went his way over the
ridge of the isle  that he might arrive early in the morning at the
other coast  because there he meant to embark  for there was a good
roadstead there  in which foreign ships also liked to anchor  those
ships took many people with them  who wished to cross over from the
happy isles  so when zarathustra thus ascended the mountain  he thought
on the way of his many solitary wanderings from youth onwards  and how
many mountains and ridges and summits he had already climbed 

i am a wanderer and mountain climber  said he to his heart  i love not
the plains  and it seemeth i cannot long sit still 

and whatever may still overtake me as fate and experience  a wandering
will be therein  and a mountain climbing  in the end one experienceth
only oneself 

the time is now past when accidents could befall me  and what could now
fall to my lot which would not already be mine own 

it returneth only  it cometh home to me at last  mine own self  and
such of it as hath been long abroad  and scattered among things and
accidents 

and one thing more do i know  i stand now before my last summit  and
before that which hath been longest reserved for me  ah  my hardest path
must i ascend  ah  i have begun my lonesomest wandering 

he  however  who is of my nature doth not avoid such an hour  the hour
that saith unto him  now only dost thou go the way to thy greatness 
summit and abyss  these are now comprised together 

thou goest the way to thy greatness  now hath it become thy last refuge 
what was hitherto thy last danger 

thou goest the way to thy greatness  it must now be thy best courage
that there is no longer any path behind thee 

thou goest the way to thy greatness  here shall no one steal after thee 
thy foot itself hath effaced the path behind thee  and over it standeth
written  impossibility 

and if all ladders henceforth fail thee  then must thou learn to mount
upon thine own head  how couldst thou mount upward otherwise 

upon thine own head  and beyond thine own heart  now must the gentlest
in thee become the hardest 

he who hath always much indulged himself  sickeneth at last by his
much indulgence  praises on what maketh hardy  i do not praise the land
where butter and honey  flow 

to learn to look away from oneself  is necessary in order to see many
things   this hardiness is needed by every mountain climber 

he  however  who is obtrusive with his eyes as a discerner  how can he
ever see more of anything than its foreground 

but thou  o zarathustra  wouldst view the ground of everything  and its
background  thus must thou mount even above thyself  up  upwards  until
thou hast even thy stars under thee 

yea  to look down upon myself  and even upon my stars  that only would i
call my summit  that hath remained for me as my last summit   

thus spake zarathustra to himself while ascending  comforting his heart
with harsh maxims  for he was sore at heart as he had never been before 
and when he had reached the top of the mountain ridge  behold  there
lay the other sea spread out before him  and he stood still and was
long silent  the night  however  was cold at this height  and clear and
starry 

i recognise my destiny  said he at last  sadly  well  i am ready  now
hath my last lonesomeness begun 

ah  this sombre  sad sea  below me  ah  this sombre nocturnal vexation 
ah  fate and sea  to you must i now go down 

before my highest mountain do i stand  and before my longest wandering 
therefore must i first go deeper down than i ever ascended 

  deeper down into pain than i ever ascended  even into its darkest
flood  so willeth my fate  well  i am ready 

whence come the highest mountains  so did i once ask  then did i learn
that they come out of the sea 

that testimony is inscribed on their stones  and on the walls of their
summits  out of the deepest must the highest come to its height   

thus spake zarathustra on the ridge of the mountain where it was cold 
when  however  he came into the vicinity of the sea  and at last stood
alone amongst the cliffs  then had he become weary on his way  and
eagerer than ever before 

everything as yet sleepeth  said he  even the sea sleepeth  drowsily and
strangely doth its eye gaze upon me 

but it breatheth warmly  i feel it  and i feel also that it dreameth  it
tosseth about dreamily on hard pillows 

hark  hark  how it groaneth with evil recollections  or evil
expectations 

ah  i am sad along with thee  thou dusky monster  and angry with myself
even for thy sake 

ah  that my hand hath not strength enough  gladly  indeed  would i free
thee from evil dreams   

and while zarathustra thus spake  he laughed at himself with melancholy
and bitterness  what  zarathustra  said he  wilt thou even sing
consolation to the sea 

ah  thou amiable fool  zarathustra  thou too blindly confiding one  but
thus hast thou ever been  ever hast thou approached confidently all that
is terrible 

every monster wouldst thou caress  a whiff of warm breath  a little soft
tuft on its paw    and immediately wert thou ready to love and lure it 

love is the danger of the lonesomest one  love to anything  if it only
live  laughable  verily  is my folly and my modesty in love   

thus spake zarathustra  and laughed thereby a second time  then 
however  he thought of his abandoned friends  and as if he had done them
a wrong with his thoughts  he upbraided himself because of his thoughts 
and forthwith it came to pass that the laugher wept  with anger and
longing wept zarathustra bitterly 




xlvi  the vision and the enigma 

1 

when it got abroad among the sailors that zarathustra was on board the
ship  for a man who came from the happy isles had gone on board along
with him   there was great curiosity and expectation  but zarathustra
kept silent for two days  and was cold and deaf with sadness  so that he
neither answered looks nor questions  on the evening of the second day 
however  he again opened his ears  though he still kept silent  for
there were many curious and dangerous things to be heard on board the
ship  which came from afar  and was to go still further  zarathustra 
however  was fond of all those who make distant voyages  and dislike to
live without danger  and behold  when listening  his own tongue was
at last loosened  and the ice of his heart broke  then did he begin to
speak thus 

to you  the daring venturers and adventurers  and whoever hath embarked
with cunning sails upon frightful seas   

to you the enigma intoxicated  the twilight enjoyers  whose souls are
allured by flutes to every treacherous gulf 

  for ye dislike to grope at a thread with cowardly hand  and where ye
can divine  there do ye hate to calculate  

to you only do i tell the enigma that i saw  the vision of the
lonesomest one   

gloomily walked i lately in corpse coloured twilight  gloomily and
sternly  with compressed lips  not only one sun had set for me 

a path which ascended daringly among boulders  an evil  lonesome path 
which neither herb nor shrub any longer cheered  a mountain path 
crunched under the daring of my foot 

mutely marching over the scornful clinking of pebbles  trampling the
stone that let it slip  thus did my foot force its way upwards 

upwards   in spite of the spirit that drew it downwards  towards the
abyss  the spirit of gravity  my devil and arch enemy 

upwards   although it sat upon me  half dwarf  half mole  paralysed 
paralysing  dripping lead in mine ear  and thoughts like drops of lead
into my brain 

 o zarathustra   it whispered scornfully  syllable by syllable   thou
stone of wisdom  thou threwest thyself high  but every thrown stone
must  fall 

o zarathustra  thou stone of wisdom  thou sling stone  thou
star destroyer  thyself threwest thou so high   but every thrown
stone  must fall 

condemned of thyself  and to thine own stoning  o zarathustra  far
indeed threwest thou thy stone  but upon thyself will it recoil  

then was the dwarf silent  and it lasted long  the silence  however 
oppressed me  and to be thus in pairs  one is verily lonesomer than when
alone 

i ascended  i ascended  i dreamt  i thought   but everything oppressed
me  a sick one did i resemble  whom bad torture wearieth  and a worse
dream reawakeneth out of his first sleep   

but there is something in me which i call courage  it hath hitherto
slain for me every dejection  this courage at last bade me stand still
and say   dwarf  thou  or i    

for courage is the best slayer   courage which attacketh  for in every
attack there is sound of triumph 

man  however  is the most courageous animal  thereby hath he overcome
every animal  with sound of triumph hath he overcome every pain  human
pain  however  is the sorest pain 

courage slayeth also giddiness at abysses  and where doth man not stand
at abysses  is not seeing itself  seeing abysses 

courage is the best slayer  courage slayeth also fellow suffering 
fellow suffering  however  is the deepest abyss  as deeply as man
looketh into life  so deeply also doth he look into suffering 

courage  however  is the best slayer  courage which attacketh  it
slayeth even death itself  for it saith   was that life  well  once
more  

in such speech  however  there is much sound of triumph  he who hath
ears to hear  let him hear   

2 

 halt  dwarf   said i   either i  or thou  i  however  am the stronger
of the two   thou knowest not mine abysmal thought  it  couldst thou not
endure  

then happened that which made me lighter  for the dwarf sprang from my
shoulder  the prying sprite  and it squatted on a stone in front of me 
there was however a gateway just where we halted 

 look at this gateway  dwarf   i continued   it hath two faces  two
roads come together here  these hath no one yet gone to the end of 

this long lane backwards  it continueth for an eternity  and that long
lane forward  that is another eternity 

they are antithetical to one another  these roads  they directly abut on
one another   and it is here  at this gateway  that they come together 
the name of the gateway is inscribed above   this moment  

but should one follow them further  and ever further and further
on  thinkest thou  dwarf  that these roads would be eternally
antithetical    

 everything straight lieth   murmured the dwarf  contemptuously   all
truth is crooked  time itself is a circle  

 thou spirit of gravity   said i wrathfully   do not take it too
lightly  or i shall let thee squat where thou squattest  haltfoot   and
i carried thee high  

 observe   continued i   this moment  from the gateway  this moment 
there runneth a long eternal lane backwards  behind us lieth an
eternity 

must not whatever can run its course of all things  have already run
along that lane  must not whatever can happen of all things have already
happened  resulted  and gone by 

and if everything have already existed  what thinkest thou  dwarf  of
this moment  must not this gateway also  have already existed 

and are not all things closely bound together in such wise that this
moment draweth all coming things after it  consequently  itself also 

for whatever can run its course of all things  also in this long lane
outward  must it once more run   

and this slow spider which creepeth in the moonlight  and this moonlight
itself  and thou and i in this gateway whispering together  whispering
of eternal things  must we not all have already existed 

  and must we not return and run in that other lane out before us  that
long weird lane  must we not eternally return    

thus did i speak  and always more softly  for i was afraid of mine own
thoughts  and arrear thoughts  then  suddenly did i hear a dog howl near
me 

had i ever heard a dog howl thus  my thoughts ran back  yes  when i was
a child  in my most distant childhood 

  then did i hear a dog howl thus  and saw it also  with hair bristling 
its head upwards  trembling in the stillest midnight  when even dogs
believe in ghosts 

  so that it excited my commiseration  for just then went the full moon 
silent as death  over the house  just then did it stand still  a glowing
globe  at rest on the flat roof  as if on some one s property   

thereby had the dog been terrified  for dogs believe in thieves and
ghosts  and when i again heard such howling  then did it excite my
commiseration once more 

where was now the dwarf  and the gateway  and the spider  and all the
whispering  had i dreamt  had i awakened   twixt rugged rocks did i
suddenly stand alone  dreary in the dreariest moonlight 

but there lay a man  and there  the dog leaping  bristling  whining  now
did it see me coming  then did it howl again  then did it cry   had i
ever heard a dog cry so for help 

and verily  what i saw  the like had i never seen  a young shepherd did
i see  writhing  choking  quivering  with distorted countenance  and
with a heavy black serpent hanging out of his mouth 

had i ever seen so much loathing and pale horror on one countenance 
he had perhaps gone to sleep  then had the serpent crawled into his
throat  there had it bitten itself fast 

my hand pulled at the serpent  and pulled   in vain  i failed to pull
the serpent out of his throat  then there cried out of me   bite  bite 

its head off  bite    so cried it out of me  my horror  my hatred  my
loathing  my pity  all my good and my bad cried with one voice out of
me   

ye daring ones around me  ye venturers and adventurers  and whoever
of you have embarked with cunning sails on unexplored seas  ye
enigma enjoyers 

solve unto me the enigma that i then beheld  interpret unto me the
vision of the lonesomest one 

for it was a vision and a foresight   what did i then behold in parable 
and who is it that must come some day 

who is the shepherd into whose throat the serpent thus crawled  who is
the man into whose throat all the heaviest and blackest will thus crawl 

  the shepherd however bit as my cry had admonished him  he bit with a
strong bite  far away did he spit the head of the serpent    and sprang
up   

no longer shepherd  no longer man  a transfigured being  a
light surrounded being  that laughed  never on earth laughed a man as he
laughed 

o my brethren  i heard a laughter which was no human laughter   and now
gnaweth a thirst at me  a longing that is never allayed 

my longing for that laughter gnaweth at me  oh  how can i still endure
to live  and how could i endure to die at present   

thus spake zarathustra 




xlvii  involuntary bliss 

with such enigmas and bitterness in his heart did zarathustra sail o er
the sea  when  however  he was four day journeys from the happy
isles and from his friends  then had he surmounted all his pain   
triumphantly and with firm foot did he again accept his fate  and then
talked zarathustra in this wise to his exulting conscience 

alone am i again  and like to be so  alone with the pure heaven  and the
open sea  and again is the afternoon around me 

on an afternoon did i find my friends for the first time  on an
afternoon  also  did i find them a second time   at the hour when all
light becometh stiller 

for whatever happiness is still on its way  twixt heaven and earth  now
seeketh for lodging a luminous soul  with happiness hath all light now
become stiller 

o afternoon of my life  once did my happiness also descend to the valley
that it might seek a lodging  then did it find those open hospitable
souls 

o afternoon of my life  what did i not surrender that i might have
one thing  this living plantation of my thoughts  and this dawn of my
highest hope 

companions did the creating one once seek  and children of his hope  and
lo  it turned out that he could not find them  except he himself should
first create them 

thus am i in the midst of my work  to my children going  and from
them returning  for the sake of his children must zarathustra perfect
himself 

for in one s heart one loveth only one s child and one s work  and where
there is great love to oneself  then is it the sign of pregnancy  so
have i found it 

still are my children verdant in their first spring  standing nigh one
another  and shaken in common by the winds  the trees of my garden and
of my best soil 

and verily  where such trees stand beside one another  there are happy
isles 

but one day will i take them up  and put each by itself alone  that it
may learn lonesomeness and defiance and prudence 

gnarled and crooked and with flexible hardness shall it then stand by
the sea  a living lighthouse of unconquerable life 

yonder where the storms rush down into the sea  and the snout of the
mountain drinketh water  shall each on a time have his day and night
watches  for his testing and recognition 

recognised and tested shall each be  to see if he be of my type and
lineage   if he be master of a long will  silent even when he speaketh 
and giving in such wise that he taketh in giving   

  so that he may one day become my companion  a fellow creator and
fellow enjoyer with zarathustra   such a one as writeth my will on my
tables  for the fuller perfection of all things 

and for his sake and for those like him  must i perfect myself 
therefore do i now avoid my happiness  and present myself to every
misfortune  for my final testing and recognition 

and verily  it were time that i went away  and the wanderer s shadow and
the longest tedium and the stillest hour  have all said unto me   it is
the highest time  

the word blew to me through the keyhole and said  come   the door sprang
subtlely open unto me  and said  go  

but i lay enchained to my love for my children  desire spread this
snare for me  the desire for love  that i should become the prey of my
children  and lose myself in them 

desiring  that is now for me to have lost myself  i possess you  my
children  in this possessing shall everything be assurance and nothing
desire 

but brooding lay the sun of my love upon me  in his own juice stewed
zarathustra   then did shadows and doubts fly past me 

for frost and winter i now longed   oh  that frost and winter would
again make me crack and crunch   sighed i   then arose icy mist out of
me 

my past burst its tomb  many pains buried alive woke up    fully slept
had they merely  concealed in corpse clothes 

so called everything unto me in signs   it is time   but i  heard not 
until at last mine abyss moved  and my thought bit me 

ah  abysmal thought  which art my thought  when shall i find strength to
hear thee burrowing  and no longer tremble 

to my very throat throbbeth my heart when i hear thee burrowing  thy
muteness even is like to strangle me  thou abysmal mute one 

as yet have i never ventured to call thee up  it hath been enough that
i  have carried thee about with me  as yet have i not been strong
enough for my final lion wantonness and playfulness 

sufficiently formidable unto me hath thy weight ever been  but one day
shall i yet find the strength and the lion s voice which will call thee
up 

when i shall have surmounted myself therein  then will i surmount myself
also in that which is greater  and a victory shall be the seal of my
perfection   

meanwhile do i sail along on uncertain seas  chance flattereth me 
smooth tongued chance  forward and backward do i gaze    still see i no
end 

as yet hath the hour of my final struggle not come to me  or doth it
come to me perhaps just now  verily  with insidious beauty do sea and
life gaze upon me round about 

o afternoon of my life  o happiness before eventide  o haven upon high
seas  o peace in uncertainty  how i distrust all of you 

verily  distrustful am i of your insidious beauty  like the lover am i 
who distrusteth too sleek smiling 

as he pusheth the best beloved before him  tender even in severity  the
jealous one    so do i push this blissful hour before me 

away with thee  thou blissful hour  with thee hath there come to me an
involuntary bliss  ready for my severest pain do i here stand   at the
wrong time hast thou come 

away with thee  thou blissful hour  rather harbour there  with my
children  hasten  and bless them before eventide with my happiness 

there  already approacheth eventide  the sun sinketh  away  my
happiness   

thus spake zarathustra  and he waited for his misfortune the whole
night  but he waited in vain  the night remained clear and calm  and
happiness itself came nigher and nigher unto him  towards morning 
however  zarathustra laughed to his heart  and said mockingly 
 happiness runneth after me  that is because i do not run after women 
happiness  however  is a woman  




xlviii  before sunrise 

o heaven above me  thou pure  thou deep heaven  thou abyss of light 
gazing on thee  i tremble with divine desires 

up to thy height to toss myself  that is my depth  in thy purity to hide
myself  that is mine innocence 

the god veileth his beauty  thus hidest thou thy stars  thou speakest
not  thus proclaimest thou thy wisdom unto me 

mute o er the raging sea hast thou risen for me to day  thy love and thy
modesty make a revelation unto my raging soul 

in that thou camest unto me beautiful  veiled in thy beauty  in that
thou spakest unto me mutely  obvious in thy wisdom 

oh  how could i fail to divine all the modesty of thy soul  before the
sun didst thou come unto me  the lonesomest one 

we have been friends from the beginning  to us are grief  gruesomeness 
and ground common  even the sun is common to us 

we do not speak to each other  because we know too much    we keep
silent to each other  we smile our knowledge to each other 

art thou not the light of my fire  hast thou not the sister soul of mine
insight 

together did we learn everything  together did we learn to ascend beyond
ourselves to ourselves  and to smile uncloudedly   

  uncloudedly to smile down out of luminous eyes and out of miles of
distance  when under us constraint and purpose and guilt steam like
rain 

and wandered i alone  for what did my soul hunger by night and in
labyrinthine paths  and climbed i mountains  whom did i ever seek  if
not thee  upon mountains 

and all my wandering and mountain climbing  a necessity was it merely 
and a makeshift of the unhandy one   to fly only  wanteth mine entire
will  to fly into thee 

and what have i hated more than passing clouds  and whatever tainteth
thee  and mine own hatred have i even hated  because it tainted thee 

the passing clouds i detest  those stealthy cats of prey  they take
from thee and me what is common to us  the vast unbounded yea  and
amen saying 

these mediators and mixers we detest  the passing clouds  those
half and half ones  that have neither learned to bless nor to curse from
the heart 

rather will i sit in a tub under a closed heaven  rather will i sit in
the abyss without heaven  than see thee  thou luminous heaven  tainted
with passing clouds 

and oft have i longed to pin them fast with the jagged gold wires of
lightning  that i might  like the thunder  beat the drum upon their
kettle bellies   

  an angry drummer  because they rob me of thy yea and amen   thou
heaven above me  thou pure  thou luminous heaven  thou abyss of
light   because they rob thee of my yea and amen 

for rather will i have noise and thunders and tempest blasts  than this
discreet  doubting cat repose  and also amongst men do i hate most
of all the soft treaders  and half and half ones  and the doubting 
hesitating  passing clouds 

and  he who cannot bless shall learn to curse    this clear teaching
dropt unto me from the clear heaven  this star standeth in my heaven
even in dark nights 

i  however  am a blesser and a yea sayer  if thou be but around me  thou
pure  thou luminous heaven  thou abyss of light   into all abysses do i
then carry my beneficent yea saying 

a blesser have i become and a yea sayer  and therefore strove i long and
was a striver  that i might one day get my hands free for blessing 

this  however  is my blessing  to stand above everything as its own
heaven  its round roof  its azure bell and eternal security  and blessed
is he who thus blesseth 

for all things are baptized at the font of eternity  and beyond good and
evil  good and evil themselves  however  are but fugitive shadows and
damp afflictions and passing clouds 

verily  it is a blessing and not a blasphemy when i teach that  above
all things there standeth the heaven of chance  the heaven of innocence 
the heaven of hazard  the heaven of wantonness  

 of hazard   that is the oldest nobility in the world  that gave i back
to all things  i emancipated them from bondage under purpose 

this freedom and celestial serenity did i put like an azure bell above
all things  when i taught that over them and through them  no  eternal
will   willeth 

this wantonness and folly did i put in place of that will  when i taught
that  in everything there is one thing impossible  rationality  

a little reason  to be sure  a germ of wisdom scattered from star to
star  this leaven is mixed in all things  for the sake of folly  wisdom
is mixed in all things 

a little wisdom is indeed possible  but this blessed security have i
found in all things  that they prefer  to dance on the feet of chance 

o heaven above me  thou pure  thou lofty heaven  this is now thy purity
unto me  that there is no eternal reason spider and reason cobweb   

  that thou art to me a dancing floor for divine chances  that thou art
to me a table of the gods  for divine dice and dice players   

but thou blushest  have i spoken unspeakable things  have i abused  when
i meant to bless thee 

or is it the shame of being two of us that maketh thee blush   dost thou
bid me go and be silent  because now  day cometh 

the world is deep   and deeper than e er the day could read  not
everything may be uttered in presence of day  but day cometh  so let us
part 

o heaven above me  thou modest one  thou glowing one  o thou  my
happiness before sunrise  the day cometh  so let us part   

thus spake zarathustra 




xlix  the bedwarfing virtue 

1 

when zarathustra was again on the continent  he did not go straightway
to his mountains and his cave  but made many wanderings and
questionings  and ascertained this and that  so that he said of himself
jestingly   lo  a river that floweth back unto its source in many
windings   for he wanted to learn what had taken place among men during
the interval  whether they had become greater or smaller  and once  when
he saw a row of new houses  he marvelled  and said 

 what do these houses mean  verily  no great soul put them up as its
simile 

did perhaps a silly child take them out of its toy box  would that
another child put them again into the box 

and these rooms and chambers  can men go out and in there  they seem to
be made for silk dolls  or for dainty eaters  who perhaps let others eat
with them  

and zarathustra stood still and meditated  at last he said sorrowfully 
 there hath everything become smaller 

everywhere do i see lower doorways  he who is of my type can still go
therethrough  but  he must stoop 

oh  when shall i arrive again at my home  where i shall no longer have
to stoop  shall no longer have to stoop before the small ones    and
zarathustra sighed  and gazed into the distance   

the same day  however  he gave his discourse on the bedwarfing virtue 

2 

i pass through this people and keep mine eyes open  they do not forgive
me for not envying their virtues 

they bite at me  because i say unto them that for small people  small
virtues are necessary  and because it is hard for me to understand that
small people are necessary 

here am i still like a cock in a strange farm yard  at which even the
hens peck  but on that account i am not unfriendly to the hens 

i am courteous towards them  as towards all small annoyances  to be
prickly towards what is small  seemeth to me wisdom for hedgehogs 

they all speak of me when they sit around their fire in the
evening  they speak of me  but no one thinketh  of me 

this is the new stillness which i have experienced  their noise around
me spreadeth a mantle over my thoughts 

they shout to one another   what is this gloomy cloud about to do to us 
let us see that it doth not bring a plague upon us  

and recently did a woman seize upon her child that was coming unto
me   take the children away   cried she   such eyes scorch children s
souls  

they cough when i speak  they think coughing an objection to strong
winds  they divine nothing of the boisterousness of my happiness 

 we have not yet time for zarathustra   so they object  but what matter
about a time that  hath no time  for zarathustra 

and if they should altogether praise me  how could i go to sleep on
their praise  a girdle of spines is their praise unto me  it scratcheth
me even when i take it off 

and this also did i learn among them  the praiser doeth as if he gave
back  in truth  however  he wanteth more to be given him 

ask my foot if their lauding and luring strains please it  verily 
to such measure and ticktack  it liketh neither to dance nor to stand
still 

to small virtues would they fain lure and laud me  to the ticktack of
small happiness would they fain persuade my foot 

i pass through this people and keep mine eyes open  they have become
smaller  and ever become smaller   the reason thereof is their doctrine
of happiness and virtue 

for they are moderate also in virtue   because they want comfort  with
comfort  however  moderate virtue only is compatible 

to be sure  they also learn in their way to stride on and stride
forward  that  i call their hobbling   thereby they become a hindrance
to all who are in haste 

and many of them go forward  and look backwards thereby  with stiffened
necks  those do i like to run up against 

foot and eye shall not lie  nor give the lie to each other  but there is
much lying among small people 

some of them will  but most of them are willed  some of them are
genuine  but most of them are bad actors 

there are actors without knowing it amongst them  and actors without
intending it    the genuine ones are always rare  especially the genuine
actors 

of man there is little here  therefore do their women masculinise
themselves  for only he who is man enough  will  save the woman in
woman 

and this hypocrisy found i worst amongst them  that even those who
command feign the virtues of those who serve 

 i serve  thou servest  we serve   so chanteth here even the hypocrisy
of the rulers  and alas  if the first lord be only the first servant 

ah  even upon their hypocrisy did mine eyes  curiosity alight  and well
did i divine all their fly happiness  and their buzzing around sunny
window panes 

so much kindness  so much weakness do i see  so much justice and pity 
so much weakness 

round  fair  and considerate are they to one another  as grains of sand
are round  fair  and considerate to grains of sand 

modestly to embrace a small happiness  that do they call  submission  
and at the same time they peer modestly after a new small happiness 

in their hearts they want simply one thing most of all  that no one hurt
them  thus do they anticipate every one s wishes and do well unto every
one 

that  however  is cowardice  though it be called  virtue    

and when they chance to speak harshly  those small people  then do  i 
hear therein only their hoarseness  every draught of air maketh them
hoarse 

shrewd indeed are they  their virtues have shrewd fingers  but they lack
fists  their fingers do not know how to creep behind fists 

virtue for them is what maketh modest and tame  therewith have they made
the wolf a dog  and man himself man s best domestic animal 

 we set our chair in the midst   so saith their smirking unto me   and
as far from dying gladiators as from satisfied swine  

that  however  is  mediocrity  though it be called moderation   

3 

i pass through this people and let fall many words  but they know
neither how to take nor how to retain them 

they wonder why i came not to revile venery and vice  and verily  i came
not to warn against pickpockets either 

they wonder why i am not ready to abet and whet their wisdom  as if they
had not yet enough of wiseacres  whose voices grate on mine ear like
slate pencils 

and when i call out   curse all the cowardly devils in you  that
would fain whimper and fold the hands and adore   then do they shout 
 zarathustra is godless  

and especially do their teachers of submission shout this   but
precisely in their ears do i love to cry   yea  i am zarathustra  the
godless  

those teachers of submission  wherever there is aught puny  or sickly 
or scabby  there do they creep like lice  and only my disgust preventeth
me from cracking them 

well  this is my sermon for their ears  i am zarathustra the godless 
who saith   who is more godless than i  that i may enjoy his teaching  

i am zarathustra the godless  where do i find mine equal  and all
those are mine equals who give unto themselves their will  and divest
themselves of all submission 

i am zarathustra the godless  i cook every chance in my pot  and only
when it hath been quite cooked do i welcome it as my food 

and verily  many a chance came imperiously unto me  but still more
imperiously did my will speak unto it   then did it lie imploringly upon
its knees  

  imploring that it might find home and heart with me  and saying
flatteringly   see  o zarathustra  how friend only cometh unto
friend    

but why talk i  when no one hath mine ears  and so will i shout it out
unto all the winds 

ye ever become smaller  ye small people  ye crumble away  ye comfortable
ones  ye will yet perish  

  by your many small virtues  by your many small omissions  and by your
many small submissions 

too tender  too yielding  so is your soil  but for a tree to become
great  it seeketh to twine hard roots around hard rocks 

also what ye omit weaveth at the web of all the human future  even your
naught is a cobweb  and a spider that liveth on the blood of the future 

and when ye take  then is it like stealing  ye small virtuous ones 
but even among knaves honour saith that  one shall only steal when one
cannot rob  

 it giveth itself   that is also a doctrine of submission  but i say
unto you  ye comfortable ones  that it taketh to itself  and will ever
take more and more from you 

ah  that ye would renounce all half willing  and would decide for
idleness as ye decide for action 

ah  that ye understood my word   do ever what ye will  but first be such
as can will 

love ever your neighbour as yourselves  but first be such as love
themselves  

  such as love with great love  such as love with great contempt   thus
speaketh zarathustra the godless   

but why talk i  when no one hath mine ears  it is still an hour too
early for me here 

mine own forerunner am i among this people  mine own cockcrow in dark
lanes 

but their hour cometh  and there cometh also mine  hourly do they become
smaller  poorer  unfruitfuller   poor herbs  poor earth 

and soon shall they stand before me like dry grass and prairie  and
verily  weary of themselves  and panting for fire  more than for water 

o blessed hour of the lightning  o mystery before noontide   running
fires will i one day make of them  and heralds with flaming tongues   

  herald shall they one day with flaming tongues  it cometh  it is nigh 
the great noontide 

thus spake zarathustra 




l  on the olive mount 

winter  a bad guest  sitteth with me at home  blue are my hands with his
friendly hand shaking 

i honour him  that bad guest  but gladly leave him alone  gladly do i
run away from him  and when one runneth well  then one escapeth him 

with warm feet and warm thoughts do i run where the wind is calm  to the
sunny corner of mine olive mount 

there do i laugh at my stern guest  and am still fond of him  because he
cleareth my house of flies  and quieteth many little noises 

for he suffereth it not if a gnat wanteth to buzz  or even two of them 
also the lanes maketh he lonesome  so that the moonlight is afraid there
at night 

a hard guest is he   but i honour him  and do not worship  like the
tenderlings  the pot bellied fire idol 

better even a little teeth chattering than idol adoration   so willeth
my nature  and especially have i a grudge against all ardent  steaming 
steamy fire idols 

him whom i love  i love better in winter than in summer  better do i
now mock at mine enemies  and more heartily  when winter sitteth in my
house 

heartily  verily  even when i creep into bed    there  still laugheth
and wantoneth my hidden happiness  even my deceptive dream laugheth 

i  a  creeper  never in my life did i creep before the powerful  and if
ever i lied  then did i lie out of love  therefore am i glad even in my
winter bed 

a poor bed warmeth me more than a rich one  for i am jealous of my
poverty  and in winter she is most faithful unto me 

with a wickedness do i begin every day  i mock at the winter with a cold
bath  on that account grumbleth my stern house mate 

also do i like to tickle him with a wax taper  that he may finally let
the heavens emerge from ashy grey twilight 

for especially wicked am i in the morning  at the early hour when the
pail rattleth at the well  and horses neigh warmly in grey lanes   

impatiently do i then wait  that the clear sky may finally dawn for me 
the snow bearded winter sky  the hoary one  the white head   

  the winter sky  the silent winter sky  which often stifleth even its
sun 

did i perhaps learn from it the long clear silence  or did it learn it
from me  or hath each of us devised it himself 

of all good things the origin is a thousandfold   all good roguish
things spring into existence for joy  how could they always do so  for
once only 

a good roguish thing is also the long silence  and to look  like the
winter sky  out of a clear  round eyed countenance   

  like it to stifle one s sun  and one s inflexible solar will  verily 
this art and this winter roguishness have i learnt well 

my best loved wickedness and art is it  that my silence hath learned not
to betray itself by silence 

clattering with diction and dice  i outwit the solemn assistants  all
those stern watchers  shall my will and purpose elude 

that no one might see down into my depth and into mine ultimate
will  for that purpose did i devise the long clear silence 

many a shrewd one did i find  he veiled his countenance and made his
water muddy  that no one might see therethrough and thereunder 

but precisely unto him came the shrewder distrusters and nut crackers 
precisely from him did they fish his best concealed fish 

but the clear  the honest  the transparent  these are for me the wisest
silent ones  in them  so profound is the depth that even the clearest
water doth not  betray it   

thou snow bearded  silent  winter sky  thou round eyed whitehead above
me  oh  thou heavenly simile of my soul and its wantonness 

and must i not conceal myself like one who hath swallowed gold  lest my
soul should be ripped up 

must i not wear stilts  that they may overlook my long legs  all those
enviers and injurers around me 

those dingy  fire warmed  used up  green tinted  ill natured souls  how
could their envy endure my happiness 

thus do i show them only the ice and winter of my peaks  and not that my
mountain windeth all the solar girdles around it 

they hear only the whistling of my winter storms  and know not that i
also travel over warm seas  like longing  heavy  hot south winds 

they commiserate also my accidents and chances   but my word saith 
 suffer the chance to come unto me  innocent is it as a little child  

how could they endure my happiness  if i did not put around it
accidents  and winter privations  and bear skin caps  and enmantling
snowflakes 

  if i did not myself commiserate their pity  the pity of those enviers
and injurers 

  if i did not myself sigh before them  and chatter with cold  and
patiently let myself be swathed in their pity 

this is the wise waggish will and good will of my soul  that it
concealeth not its winters and glacial storms  it concealeth not its
chilblains either 

to one man  lonesomeness is the flight of the sick one  to another  it
is the flight from the sick ones 

let them hear me chattering and sighing with winter cold  all those poor
squinting knaves around me  with such sighing and chattering do i flee
from their heated rooms 

let them sympathise with me and sigh with me on account of my
chilblains   at the ice of knowledge will he yet freeze to death    so
they mourn 

meanwhile do i run with warm feet hither and thither on mine
olive mount  in the sunny corner of mine olive mount do i sing  and mock
at all pity   

thus sang zarathustra 




li  on passing by 

thus slowly wandering through many peoples and divers cities  did
zarathustra return by round about roads to his mountains and his cave 
and behold  thereby came he unawares also to the gate of the great city 
here  however  a foaming fool  with extended hands  sprang forward to
him and stood in his way  it was the same fool whom the people called
 the ape of zarathustra   for he had learned from him something of the
expression and modulation of language  and perhaps liked also to borrow
from the store of his wisdom  and the fool talked thus to zarathustra 

o zarathustra  here is the great city  here hast thou nothing to seek
and everything to lose 

why wouldst thou wade through this mire  have pity upon thy foot  spit
rather on the gate of the city  and  turn back 

here is the hell for anchorites  thoughts  here are great thoughts
seethed alive and boiled small 

here do all great sentiments decay  here may only rattle boned
sensations rattle 

smellest thou not already the shambles and cookshops of the spirit 
steameth not this city with the fumes of slaughtered spirit 

seest thou not the souls hanging like limp dirty rags   and they make
newspapers also out of these rags 

hearest thou not how spirit hath here become a verbal game  loathsome
verbal swill doth it vomit forth   and they make newspapers also out of
this verbal swill 

they hound one another  and know not whither  they inflame one another 
and know not why  they tinkle with their pinchbeck  they jingle with
their gold 

they are cold  and seek warmth from distilled waters  they are inflamed 
and seek coolness from frozen spirits  they are all sick and sore
through public opinion 

all lusts and vices are here at home  but here there are also the
virtuous  there is much appointable appointed virtue   

much appointable virtue with scribe fingers  and hardy sitting flesh and
waiting flesh  blessed with small breast stars  and padded  haunchless
daughters 

there is here also much piety  and much faithful spittle licking and
spittle backing  before the god of hosts 

 from on high   drippeth the star  and the gracious spittle  for the
high  longeth every starless bosom 

the moon hath its court  and the court hath its moon calves  unto all 
however  that cometh from the court do the mendicant people pray  and
all appointable mendicant virtues 

 i serve  thou servest  we serve   so prayeth all appointable virtue
to the prince  that the merited star may at last stick on the slender
breast 

but the moon still revolveth around all that is earthly  so revolveth
also the prince around what is earthliest of all  that  however  is the
gold of the shopman 

the god of the hosts of war is not the god of the golden bar  the prince
proposeth  but the shopman  disposeth 

by all that is luminous and strong and good in thee  o zarathustra  spit
on this city of shopmen and return back 

here floweth all blood putridly and tepidly and frothily through all
veins  spit on the great city  which is the great slum where all the
scum frotheth together 

spit on the city of compressed souls and slender breasts  of pointed
eyes and sticky fingers  

  on the city of the obtrusive  the brazen faced  the pen demagogues and
tongue demagogues  the overheated ambitious   

where everything maimed  ill famed  lustful  untrustful  over mellow 
sickly yellow and seditious  festereth pernicious   

  spit on the great city and turn back   

here  however  did zarathustra interrupt the foaming fool  and shut his
mouth   

stop this at once  called out zarathustra  long have thy speech and thy
species disgusted me 

why didst thou live so long by the swamp  that thou thyself hadst to
become a frog and a toad 

floweth there not a tainted  frothy  swamp blood in thine own veins 
when thou hast thus learned to croak and revile 

why wentest thou not into the forest  or why didst thou not till the
ground  is the sea not full of green islands 

i despise thy contempt  and when thou warnedst me  why didst thou not
warn thyself 

out of love alone shall my contempt and my warning bird take wing  but
not out of the swamp   

they call thee mine ape  thou foaming fool  but i call thee my
grunting pig   by thy grunting  thou spoilest even my praise of folly 

what was it that first made thee grunt  because no one sufficiently
flattered thee   therefore didst thou seat thyself beside this filth 
that thou mightest have cause for much grunting   

  that thou mightest have cause for much vengeance  for vengeance  thou
vain fool  is all thy foaming  i have divined thee well 

but thy fools  word injureth me  even when thou art right  and even if
zarathustra s word were a hundred times justified  thou wouldst ever  do
wrong with my word 

thus spake zarathustra  then did he look on the great city and sighed 
and was long silent  at last he spake thus 

i loathe also this great city  and not only this fool  here and there  
there is nothing to better  nothing to worsen 

woe to this great city   and i would that i already saw the pillar of
fire in which it will be consumed 

for such pillars of fire must precede the great noontide  but this hath
its time and its own fate   

this precept  however  give i unto thee  in parting  thou fool  where
one can no longer love  there should one  pass by   

thus spake zarathustra  and passed by the fool and the great city 




lii  the apostates 

1 

ah  lieth everything already withered and grey which but lately stood
green and many hued on this meadow  and how much honey of hope did i
carry hence into my beehives 

those young hearts have already all become old  and not old even  only
weary  ordinary  comfortable   they declare it   we have again become
pious  

of late did i see them run forth at early morn with valorous steps  but
the feet of their knowledge became weary  and now do they malign even
their morning valour 

verily  many of them once lifted their legs like the dancer  to them
winked the laughter of my wisdom   then did they bethink themselves 
just now have i seen them bent down  to creep to the cross 

around light and liberty did they once flutter like gnats and young
poets  a little older  a little colder  and already are they mystifiers 
and mumblers and mollycoddles 

did perhaps their hearts despond  because lonesomeness had swallowed me
like a whale  did their ear perhaps hearken yearningly long for me in
vain  and for my trumpet notes and herald calls 

  ah  ever are there but few of those whose hearts have persistent
courage and exuberance  and in such remaineth also the spirit patient 
the rest  however  are cowardly 

the rest  these are always the great majority  the common place  the
superfluous  the far too many  those all are cowardly   

him who is of my type  will also the experiences of my type meet on the
way  so that his first companions must be corpses and buffoons 

his second companions  however  they will call themselves his
believers   will be a living host  with much love  much folly  much
unbearded veneration 

to those believers shall he who is of my type among men not bind his
heart  in those spring times and many hued meadows shall he not believe 
who knoweth the fickly faint hearted human species 

could they do otherwise  then would they also will otherwise  the
half and half spoil every whole  that leaves become withered   what is
there to lament about that 

let them go and fall away  o zarathustra  and do not lament  better even
to blow amongst them with rustling winds   

  blow amongst those leaves  o zarathustra  that everything withered may
run away from thee the faster   

2 

 we have again become pious   so do those apostates confess  and some of
them are still too pusillanimous thus to confess 

unto them i look into the eye   before them i say it unto their face and
unto the blush on their cheeks  ye are those who again pray 

it is however a shame to pray  not for all  but for thee  and me  and
whoever hath his conscience in his head  for thee it is a shame to pray 

thou knowest it well  the faint hearted devil in thee  which would
fain fold its arms  and place its hands in its bosom  and take it
easier   this faint hearted devil persuadeth thee that  there is a god  

thereby  however  dost thou belong to the light dreading type  to whom
light never permitteth repose  now must thou daily thrust thy head
deeper into obscurity and vapour 

and verily  thou choosest the hour well  for just now do the nocturnal
birds again fly abroad  the hour hath come for all light dreading
people  the vesper hour and leisure hour  when they do not   take
leisure  

i hear it and smell it  it hath come  their hour for hunt and
procession  not indeed for a wild hunt  but for a tame  lame  snuffling 
soft treaders   soft prayers  hunt   

  for a hunt after susceptible simpletons  all mouse traps for the heart
have again been set  and whenever i lift a curtain  a night moth rusheth
out of it 

did it perhaps squat there along with another night moth  for everywhere
do i smell small concealed communities  and wherever there are closets
there are new devotees therein  and the atmosphere of devotees 

they sit for long evenings beside one another  and say   let us again
become like little children and say   good god     ruined in mouths and
stomachs by the pious confectioners 

or they look for long evenings at a crafty  lurking cross spider  that
preacheth prudence to the spiders themselves  and teacheth that  under
crosses it is good for cobweb spinning  

or they sit all day at swamps with angle rods  and on that account think
themselves profound  but whoever fisheth where there are no fish  i do
not even call him superficial 

or they learn in godly gay style to play the harp with a hymn poet 
who would fain harp himself into the heart of young girls   for he hath
tired of old girls and their praises 

or they learn to shudder with a learned semi madcap  who waiteth in
darkened rooms for spirits to come to him  and the spirit runneth away
entirely 

or they listen to an old roving howl and growl piper  who hath learnt
from the sad winds the sadness of sounds  now pipeth he as the wind  and
preacheth sadness in sad strains 

and some of them have even become night watchmen  they know now how to
blow horns  and go about at night and awaken old things which have long
fallen asleep 

five words about old things did i hear yester night at the garden wall 
they came from such old  sorrowful  arid night watchmen 

 for a father he careth not sufficiently for his children  human fathers
do this better    

 he is too old  he now careth no more for his children    answered the
other night watchman 

 hath he then children  no one can prove it unless he himself prove it 
i have long wished that he would for once prove it thoroughly  

 prove  as if he had ever proved anything  proving is difficult to him 
he layeth great stress on one s believing him  

 ay  ay  belief saveth him  belief in him  that is the way with old
people  so it is with us also    

  thus spake to each other the two old night watchmen and light scarers 
and tooted thereupon sorrowfully on their horns  so did it happen
yester night at the garden wall 

to me  however  did the heart writhe with laughter  and was like to
break  it knew not where to go  and sunk into the midriff 

verily  it will be my death yet  to choke with laughter when i see asses
drunken  and hear night watchmen thus doubt about god 

hath the time not long since passed for all such doubts  who may
nowadays awaken such old slumbering  light shunning things 

with the old deities hath it long since come to an end   and verily  a
good joyful deity end had they 

they did not  begloom  themselves to death  that do people fabricate  on
the contrary  they  laughed themselves to death once on a time 

that took place when the ungodliest utterance came from a god
himself  the utterance   there is but one god  thou shalt have no other
gods before me    

  an old grim beard of a god  a jealous one  forgot himself in such
wise   

and all the gods then laughed  and shook upon their thrones  and
exclaimed   is it not just divinity that there are gods  but no god  

he that hath an ear let him hear   

thus talked zarathustra in the city he loved  which is surnamed  the
pied cow   for from here he had but two days to travel to reach once
more his cave and his animals  his soul  however  rejoiced unceasingly
on account of the nighness of his return home 




liii  the return home 

o lonesomeness  my home  lonesomeness  too long have i lived wildly in
wild remoteness  to return to thee without tears 

now threaten me with the finger as mothers threaten  now smile upon me
as mothers smile  now say just   who was it that like a whirlwind once
rushed away from me   

  who when departing called out   too long have i sat with lonesomeness 
there have i unlearned silence   that hast thou learned now  surely 

o zarathustra  everything do i know  and that thou wert more forsaken
amongst the many  thou unique one  than thou ever wert with me 

one thing is forsakenness  another matter is lonesomeness  that hast
thou now learned  and that amongst men thou wilt ever be wild and
strange 

  wild and strange even when they love thee  for above all they want to
be treated indulgently 

here  however  art thou at home and house with thyself  here canst thou
utter everything  and unbosom all motives  nothing is here ashamed of
concealed  congealed feelings 

here do all things come caressingly to thy talk and flatter thee  for
they want to ride upon thy back  on every simile dost thou here ride to
every truth 

uprightly and openly mayest thou here talk to all things  and verily 
it soundeth as praise in their ears  for one to talk to all
things  directly 

another matter  however  is forsakenness  for  dost thou remember  o
zarathustra  when thy bird screamed overhead  when thou stoodest in the
forest  irresolute  ignorant where to go  beside a corpse   

  when thou spakest   let mine animals lead me  more dangerous have i
found it among men than among animals    that was forsakenness 

and dost thou remember  o zarathustra  when thou sattest in thine isle 
a well of wine giving and granting amongst empty buckets  bestowing and
distributing amongst the thirsty 

  until at last thou alone sattest thirsty amongst the drunken ones  and
wailedst nightly   is taking not more blessed than giving  and stealing
yet more blessed than taking    that was forsakenness 

and dost thou remember  o zarathustra  when thy stillest hour came and
drove thee forth from thyself  when with wicked whispering it said 
 speak and succumb    

  when it disgusted thee with all thy waiting and silence  and
discouraged thy humble courage  that was forsakenness    

o lonesomeness  my home  lonesomeness  how blessedly and tenderly
speaketh thy voice unto me 

we do not question each other  we do not complain to each other  we go
together openly through open doors 

for all is open with thee and clear  and even the hours run here on
lighter feet  for in the dark  time weigheth heavier upon one than in
the light 

here fly open unto me all being s words and word cabinets  here all
being wanteth to become words  here all becoming wanteth to learn of me
how to talk 

down there  however  all talking is in vain  there  forgetting and
passing by are the best wisdom  that have i learned now 

he who would understand everything in man must handle everything  but
for that i have too clean hands 

i do not like even to inhale their breath  alas  that i have lived so
long among their noise and bad breaths 

o blessed stillness around me  o pure odours around me  how from a deep
breast this stillness fetcheth pure breath  how it hearkeneth  this
blessed stillness 

but down there  there speaketh everything  there is everything misheard 
if one announce one s wisdom with bells  the shopmen in the market place
will out jingle it with pennies 

everything among them talketh  no one knoweth any longer how to
understand  everything falleth into the water  nothing falleth any
longer into deep wells 

everything among them talketh  nothing succeedeth any longer and
accomplisheth itself  everything cackleth  but who will still sit
quietly on the nest and hatch eggs 

everything among them talketh  everything is out talked  and that which
yesterday was still too hard for time itself and its tooth  hangeth
to day  outchamped and outchewed  from the mouths of the men of to day 

everything among them talketh  everything is betrayed  and what was once
called the secret and secrecy of profound souls  belongeth to day to the
street trumpeters and other butterflies 

o human hubbub  thou wonderful thing  thou noise in dark streets  now
art thou again behind me   my greatest danger lieth behind me 

in indulging and pitying lay ever my greatest danger  and all human
hubbub wisheth to be indulged and tolerated 

with suppressed truths  with fool s hand and befooled heart  and rich in
petty lies of pity   thus have i ever lived among men 

disguised did i sit amongst them  ready to misjudge myself that i might
endure them  and willingly saying to myself   thou fool  thou dost not
know men  

one unlearneth men when one liveth amongst them  there is too much
foreground in all men  what can far seeing  far longing eyes do there 

and  fool that i was  when they misjudged me  i indulged them on that
account more than myself  being habitually hard on myself  and often
even taking revenge on myself for the indulgence 

stung all over by poisonous flies  and hollowed like the stone by
many drops of wickedness  thus did i sit among them  and still said to
myself   innocent is everything petty of its pettiness  

especially did i find those who call themselves  the good   the most
poisonous flies  they sting in all innocence  they lie in all innocence 
how could they  be just towards me 

he who liveth amongst the good  pity teacheth him to lie  pity maketh
stifling air for all free souls  for the stupidity of the good is
unfathomable 

to conceal myself and my riches  that did i learn down there  for every
one did i still find poor in spirit  it was the lie of my pity  that i
knew in every one 

  that i saw and scented in every one  what was enough of spirit for
him  and what was too much 

their stiff wise men  i call them wise  not stiff  thus did i learn to
slur over words 

the grave diggers dig for themselves diseases  under old rubbish rest
bad vapours  one should not stir up the marsh  one should live on
mountains 

with blessed nostrils do i again breathe mountain freedom  freed at last
is my nose from the smell of all human hubbub 

with sharp breezes tickled  as with sparkling wine  sneezeth my soul  
sneezeth  and shouteth self congratulatingly   health to thee  

thus spake zarathustra 




liv  the three evil things 

1 

in my dream  in my last morning dream  i stood to day on a promontory  
beyond the world  i held a pair of scales  and weighed the world 

alas  that the rosy dawn came too early to me  she glowed me awake  the
jealous one  jealous is she always of the glows of my morning dream 

measurable by him who hath time  weighable by a good weigher  attainable
by strong pinions  divinable by divine nut crackers  thus did my dream
find the world   

my dream  a bold sailor  half ship  half hurricane  silent as the
butterfly  impatient as the falcon  how had it the patience and leisure
to day for world weighing 

did my wisdom perhaps speak secretly to it  my laughing  wide awake
day wisdom  which mocketh at all  infinite worlds   for it saith   where
force is  there becometh number the master  it hath more force  

how confidently did my dream contemplate this finite world  not
new fangledly  not old fangledly  not timidly  not entreatingly   

  as if a big round apple presented itself to my hand  a ripe golden
apple  with a coolly soft  velvety skin   thus did the world present
itself unto me   

  as if a tree nodded unto me  a broad branched  strong willed tree 
curved as a recline and a foot stool for weary travellers  thus did the
world stand on my promontory   

  as if delicate hands carried a casket towards me  a casket open for
the delectation of modest adoring eyes  thus did the world present
itself before me to day   

  not riddle enough to scare human love from it  not solution enough
to put to sleep human wisdom   a humanly good thing was the world to me
to day  of which such bad things are said 

how i thank my morning dream that i thus at to day s dawn  weighed
the world  as a humanly good thing did it come unto me  this dream and
heart comforter 

and that i may do the like by day  and imitate and copy its best  now
will i put the three worst things on the scales  and weigh them humanly
well   

he who taught to bless taught also to curse  what are the three best
cursed things in the world  these will i put on the scales 

voluptuousness  passion for power  and selfishness  these three things
have hitherto been best cursed  and have been in worst and falsest
repute  these three things will i weigh humanly well 

well  here is my promontory  and there is the sea  it rolleth hither
unto me  shaggily and fawningly  the old  faithful  hundred headed
dog monster that i love   

well  here will i hold the scales over the weltering sea  and also a
witness do i choose to look on  thee  the anchorite tree  thee  the
strong odoured  broad arched tree that i love   

on what bridge goeth the now to the hereafter  by what constraint doth
the high stoop to the low  and what enjoineth even the highest still  to
grow upwards   

now stand the scales poised and at rest  three heavy questions have i
thrown in  three heavy answers carrieth the other scale 

2 

voluptuousness  unto all hair shirted despisers of the body  a sting and
stake  and  cursed as  the world   by all backworldsmen  for it mocketh
and befooleth all erring  misinferring teachers 

voluptuousness  to the rabble  the slow fire at which it is burnt 
to all wormy wood  to all stinking rags  the prepared heat and stew
furnace 

voluptuousness  to free hearts  a thing innocent and free  the
garden happiness of the earth  all the future s thanks overflow to the
present 

voluptuousness  only to the withered a sweet poison  to the lion willed 
however  the great cordial  and the reverently saved wine of wines 

voluptuousness  the great symbolic happiness of a higher happiness
and highest hope  for to many is marriage promised  and more than
marriage   

  to many that are more unknown to each other than man and woman   and
who hath fully understood how unknown to each other are man and woman 

voluptuousness   but i will have hedges around my thoughts  and
even around my words  lest swine and libertine should break into my
gardens   

passion for power  the glowing scourge of the hardest of the heart hard 
the cruel torture reserved for the cruellest themselves  the gloomy
flame of living pyres 

passion for power  the wicked gadfly which is mounted on the vainest
peoples  the scorner of all uncertain virtue  which rideth on every
horse and on every pride 

passion for power  the earthquake which breaketh and upbreaketh all
that is rotten and hollow  the rolling  rumbling  punitive demolisher
of whited sepulchres  the flashing interrogative sign beside premature
answers 

passion for power  before whose glance man creepeth and croucheth and
drudgeth  and becometh lower than the serpent and the swine   until at
last great contempt crieth out of him   

passion for power  the terrible teacher of great contempt  which
preacheth to their face to cities and empires   away with thee    until
a voice crieth out of themselves   away with me  

passion for power  which  however  mounteth alluringly even to the pure
and lonesome  and up to self satisfied elevations  glowing like a love
that painteth purple felicities alluringly on earthly heavens 

passion for power  but who would call it passion  when the height
longeth to stoop for power  verily  nothing sick or diseased is there in
such longing and descending 

that the lonesome height may not for ever remain lonesome and
self sufficing  that the mountains may come to the valleys and the winds
of the heights to the plains   

oh  who could find the right prenomen and honouring name for such
longing   bestowing virtue   thus did zarathustra once name the
unnamable 

and then it happened also   and verily  it happened for the first
time   that his word blessed selfishness  the wholesome  healthy
selfishness  that springeth from the powerful soul   

  from the powerful soul  to which the high body appertaineth  the
handsome  triumphing  refreshing body  around which everything becometh
a mirror 

  the pliant  persuasive body  the dancer  whose symbol and epitome
is the self enjoying soul  of such bodies and souls the self enjoyment
calleth itself  virtue  

with its words of good and bad doth such self enjoyment shelter itself
as with sacred groves  with the names of its happiness doth it banish
from itself everything contemptible 

away from itself doth it banish everything cowardly  it saith 
 bad  that is cowardly   contemptible seem to it the ever solicitous 
the sighing  the complaining  and whoever pick up the most trifling
advantage 

it despiseth also all bitter sweet wisdom  for verily  there is also
wisdom that bloometh in the dark  a night shade wisdom  which ever
sigheth   all is vain  

shy distrust is regarded by it as base  and every one who wanteth oaths
instead of looks and hands  also all over distrustful wisdom   for such
is the mode of cowardly souls 

baser still it regardeth the obsequious  doggish one  who immediately
lieth on his back  the submissive one  and there is also wisdom that is
submissive  and doggish  and pious  and obsequious 

hateful to it altogether  and a loathing  is he who will never defend
himself  he who swalloweth down poisonous spittle and bad looks  the
all too patient one  the all endurer  the all satisfied one  for that is
the mode of slaves 

whether they be servile before gods and divine spurnings  or before men
and stupid human opinions  at all kinds of slaves doth it spit  this
blessed selfishness 

bad  thus doth it call all that is spirit broken  and
sordidly servile  constrained  blinking eyes  depressed hearts  and the
false submissive style  which kisseth with broad cowardly lips 

and spurious wisdom  so doth it call all the wit that slaves  and
hoary headed and weary ones affect  and especially all the cunning 
spurious witted  curious witted foolishness of priests 

the spurious wise  however  all the priests  the world weary  and those
whose souls are of feminine and servile nature  oh  how hath their game
all along abused selfishness 

and precisely that was to be virtue and was to be called virtue  to
abuse selfishness  and  selfless   so did they wish themselves with good
reason  all those world weary cowards and cross spiders 

but to all those cometh now the day  the change  the sword of judgment 
the great noontide  then shall many things be revealed 

and he who proclaimeth the ego wholesome and holy  and selfishness
blessed  verily  he  the prognosticator  speaketh also what he knoweth 
 behold  it cometh  it is nigh  the great noontide  

thus spake zarathustra 




lv  the spirit of gravity 

1 

my mouthpiece  is of the people  too coarsely and cordially do i
talk for angora rabbits  and still stranger soundeth my word unto all
ink fish and pen foxes 

my hand  is a fool s hand  woe unto all tables and walls  and whatever
hath room for fool s sketching  fool s scrawling 

my foot  is a horse foot  therewith do i trample and trot over stick and
stone  in the fields up and down  and am bedevilled with delight in all
fast racing 

my stomach  is surely an eagle s stomach  for it preferreth lamb s
flesh  certainly it is a bird s stomach 

nourished with innocent things  and with few  ready and impatient
to fly  to fly away  that is now my nature  why should there not be
something of bird nature therein 

and especially that i am hostile to the spirit of gravity  that is
bird nature   verily  deadly hostile  supremely hostile  originally
hostile  oh  whither hath my hostility not flown and misflown 

thereof could i sing a song  and will sing it  though i be alone in an
empty house  and must sing it to mine own ears 

other singers are there  to be sure  to whom only the full house
maketh the voice soft  the hand eloquent  the eye expressive  the heart
wakeful   those do i not resemble   

2 

he who one day teacheth men to fly will have shifted all landmarks  to
him will all landmarks themselves fly into the air  the earth will he
christen anew  as  the light body  

the ostrich runneth faster than the fastest horse  but it also thrusteth
its head heavily into the heavy earth  thus is it with the man who
cannot yet fly 

heavy unto him are earth and life  and so willeth the spirit of gravity 
but he who would become light  and be a bird  must love himself   thus
do  i  teach 

not  to be sure  with the love of the sick and infected  for with them
stinketh even self love 

one must learn to love oneself  thus do i teach  with a wholesome and
healthy love  that one may endure to be with oneself  and not go roving
about 

such roving about christeneth itself  brotherly love   with these words
hath there hitherto been the best lying and dissembling  and especially
by those who have been burdensome to every one 

and verily  it is no commandment for to day and to morrow to learn to
love oneself  rather is it of all arts the finest  subtlest  last and
patientest 

for to its possessor is all possession well concealed  and of all
treasure pits one s own is last excavated  so causeth the spirit of
gravity 

almost in the cradle are we apportioned with heavy words and worths 
 good  and  evil   so calleth itself this dowry  for the sake of it we
are forgiven for living 

and therefore suffereth one little children to come unto one  to forbid
them betimes to love themselves  so causeth the spirit of gravity 

and we  we bear loyally what is apportioned unto us  on hard shoulders 
over rugged mountains  and when we sweat  then do people say to us 
 yea  life is hard to bear  

but man himself only is hard to bear  the reason thereof is that he
carrieth too many extraneous things on his shoulders  like the camel
kneeleth he down  and letteth himself be well laden 

especially the strong load bearing man in whom reverence resideth  too
many extraneous heavy words and worths loadeth he upon himself  then
seemeth life to him a desert 

and verily  many a thing also that is our own is hard to bear  and many
internal things in man are like the oyster  repulsive and slippery and
hard to grasp   

so that an elegant shell  with elegant adornment  must plead for
them  but this art also must one learn  to have a shell  and a fine
appearance  and sagacious blindness 

again  it deceiveth about many things in man  that many a shell is poor
and pitiable  and too much of a shell  much concealed goodness and power
is never dreamt of  the choicest dainties find no tasters 

women know that  the choicest of them  a little fatter a little leaner  
oh  how much fate is in so little 

man is difficult to discover  and unto himself most difficult of all 
often lieth the spirit concerning the soul  so causeth the spirit of
gravity 

he  however  hath discovered himself who saith  this is my good and
evil  therewith hath he silenced the mole and the dwarf  who say   good
for all  evil for all  

verily  neither do i like those who call everything good  and this world
the best of all  those do i call the all satisfied 

all satisfiedness  which knoweth how to taste everything   that is
not the best taste  i honour the refractory  fastidious tongues and
stomachs  which have learned to say  i  and  yea  and  nay  

to chew and digest everything  however  that is the genuine
swine nature  ever to say ye a  that hath only the ass learnt  and those
like it   

deep yellow and hot red  so wanteth my taste  it mixeth blood with all
colours  he  however  who whitewasheth his house  betrayeth unto me a
whitewashed soul 

with mummies  some fall in love  others with phantoms  both alike
hostile to all flesh and blood  oh  how repugnant are both to my taste 
for i love blood 

and there will i not reside and abide where every one spitteth and
speweth  that is now my taste   rather would i live amongst thieves and
perjurers  nobody carrieth gold in his mouth 

still more repugnant unto me  however  are all lickspittles  and the
most repugnant animal of man that i found  did i christen  parasite   it
would not love  and would yet live by love 

unhappy do i call all those who have only one choice  either to become
evil beasts  or evil beast tamers  amongst such would i not build my
tabernacle 

unhappy do i also call those who have ever to wait   they are repugnant
to my taste  all the toll gatherers and traders  and kings  and other
landkeepers and shopkeepers 

verily  i learned waiting also  and thoroughly so   but only waiting for
myself  and above all did i learn standing and walking and running and
leaping and climbing and dancing 

this however is my teaching  he who wisheth one day to fly  must first
learn standing and walking and running and climbing and dancing   one
doth not fly into flying 

with rope ladders learned i to reach many a window  with nimble legs did
i climb high masts  to sit on high masts of perception seemed to me no
small bliss   

  to flicker like small flames on high masts  a small light  certainly 
but a great comfort to cast away sailors and ship wrecked ones 

by divers ways and wendings did i arrive at my truth  not by one ladder
did i mount to the height where mine eye roveth into my remoteness 

and unwillingly only did i ask my way  that was always counter to my
taste  rather did i question and test the ways themselves 

a testing and a questioning hath been all my travelling   and verily 
one must also learn to answer such questioning  that  however   is my
taste 

  neither a good nor a bad taste  but my taste  of which i have no
longer either shame or secrecy 

 this  is now my way   where is yours   thus did i answer those who
asked me  the way   for the way  it doth not exist 

thus spake zarathustra 




lvi  old and new tables 

1 

here do i sit and wait  old broken tables around me and also new
half written tables  when cometh mine hour 

  the hour of my descent  of my down going  for once more will i go unto
men 

for that hour do i now wait  for first must the signs come unto me that
it is mine hour  namely  the laughing lion with the flock of doves 

meanwhile do i talk to myself as one who hath time  no one telleth me
anything new  so i tell myself mine own story 

2 

when i came unto men  then found i them resting on an old infatuation 
all of them thought they had long known what was good and bad for men 

an old wearisome business seemed to them all discourse about virtue  and
he who wished to sleep well spake of  good  and  bad  ere retiring to
rest 

this somnolence did i disturb when i taught that no one yet knoweth what
is good and bad   unless it be the creating one 

  it is he  however  who createth man s goal  and giveth to the earth
its meaning and its future  he only effecteth it that aught is good or
bad 

and i bade them upset their old academic chairs  and wherever that old
infatuation had sat  i bade them laugh at their great moralists  their
saints  their poets  and their saviours 

at their gloomy sages did i bid them laugh  and whoever had sat
admonishing as a black scarecrow on the tree of life 

on their great grave highway did i seat myself  and even beside the
carrion and vultures  and i laughed at all their bygone and its mellow
decaying glory 

verily  like penitential preachers and fools did i cry wrath and shame
on all their greatness and smallness  oh  that their best is so very
small  oh  that their worst is so very small  thus did i laugh 

thus did my wise longing  born in the mountains  cry and laugh in me  a
wild wisdom  verily   my great pinion rustling longing 

and oft did it carry me off and up and away and in the midst of
laughter  then flew i quivering like an arrow with sun intoxicated
rapture 

  out into distant futures  which no dream hath yet seen  into warmer
souths than ever sculptor conceived   where gods in their dancing are
ashamed of all clothes 

 that i may speak in parables and halt and stammer like the poets  and
verily i am ashamed that i have still to be a poet  

where all becoming seemed to me dancing of gods  and wantoning of gods 
and the world unloosed and unbridled and fleeing back to itself   

  as an eternal self fleeing and re seeking of one another of many gods 
as the blessed self contradicting  recommuning  and refraternising with
one another of many gods   

where all time seemed to me a blessed mockery of moments  where
necessity was freedom itself  which played happily with the goad of
freedom   

where i also found again mine old devil and arch enemy  the spirit
of gravity  and all that it created  constraint  law  necessity and
consequence and purpose and will and good and evil   

for must there not be that which is danced over  danced beyond  must
there not  for the sake of the nimble  the nimblest   be moles and
clumsy dwarfs   

3 

there was it also where i picked up from the path the word  superman  
 and that man is something that must be surpassed 

  that man is a bridge and not a goal  rejoicing over his noontides and
evenings  as advances to new rosy dawns 

  the zarathustra word of the great noontide  and whatever else i have
hung up over men like purple evening afterglows 

verily  also new stars did i make them see  along with new nights 
and over cloud and day and night  did i spread out laughter like a
gay coloured canopy 

i taught them all my poetisation and aspiration  to compose and collect
into unity what is fragment in man  and riddle and fearful chance   

  as composer  riddle reader  and redeemer of chance  did i teach them
to create the future  and all that hath been  to redeem by creating 

the past of man to redeem  and every  it was  to transform  until the
will saith   but so did i will it  so shall i will it   

  this did i call redemption  this alone taught i them to call
redemption   

now do i await my redemption  that i may go unto them for the last time 

for once more will i go unto men  amongst them will my sun set  in dying
will i give them my choicest gift 

from the sun did i learn this  when it goeth down  the exuberant one 
gold doth it then pour into the sea  out of inexhaustible riches   

  so that the poorest fisherman roweth even with golden oars  for this
did i once see  and did not tire of weeping in beholding it   

like the sun will also zarathustra go down  now sitteth he here
and waiteth  old broken tables around him  and also new
tables  half written 

4 

behold  here is a new table  but where are my brethren who will carry it
with me to the valley and into hearts of flesh   

thus demandeth my great love to the remotest ones  be not considerate of
thy neighbour  man is something that must be surpassed 

there are many divers ways and modes of surpassing  see thou thereto 
but only a buffoon thinketh   man can also be overleapt  

surpass thyself even in thy neighbour  and a right which thou canst
seize upon  shalt thou not allow to be given thee 

what thou doest can no one do to thee again  lo  there is no requital 

he who cannot command himself shall obey  and many a one can command
himself  but still sorely lacketh self obedience 

5 

thus wisheth the type of noble souls  they desire to have nothing
gratuitously  least of all  life 

he who is of the populace wisheth to live gratuitously  we others 
however  to whom life hath given itself  we are ever considering what we
can best give in return 

and verily  it is a noble dictum which saith   what life promiseth us 
that promise will we keep  to life  

one should not wish to enjoy where one doth not contribute to the
enjoyment  and one should not wish to enjoy 

for enjoyment and innocence are the most bashful things  neither like
to be sought for  one should have them   but one should rather seek for
guilt and pain   

6 

o my brethren  he who is a firstling is ever sacrificed  now  however 
are we firstlings 

we all bleed on secret sacrificial altars  we all burn and broil in
honour of ancient idols 

our best is still young  this exciteth old palates  our flesh is tender 
our skin is only lambs  skin   how could we not excite old idol priests 

in ourselves dwelleth he still  the old idol priest  who broileth our
best for his banquet  ah  my brethren  how could firstlings fail to be
sacrifices 

but so wisheth our type  and i love those who do not wish to preserve
themselves  the down going ones do i love with mine entire love  for
they go beyond   

7 

to be true  that can few be  and he who can  will not  least of all 
however  can the good be true 

oh  those good ones  good men never speak the truth  for the spirit 
thus to be good  is a malady 

they yield  those good ones  they submit themselves  their heart
repeateth  their soul obeyeth  he  however  who obeyeth  doth not listen
to himself 

all that is called evil by the good  must come together in order that
one truth may be born  o my brethren  are ye also evil enough for this
truth 

the daring venture  the prolonged distrust  the cruel nay  the tedium 
the cutting into the quick  how seldom do these come together  out of
such seed  however  is truth produced 

beside the bad conscience hath hitherto grown all knowledge  break up 
break up  ye discerning ones  the old tables 

8 

when the water hath planks  when gangways and railings o erspan the
stream  verily  he is not believed who then saith   all is in flux  

but even the simpletons contradict him   what   say the simpletons   all
in flux  planks and railings are still over the stream 

 over the stream all is stable  all the values of things  the bridges
and bearings  all  good  and  evil   these are all stable    

cometh  however  the hard winter  the stream tamer  then learn even the
wittiest distrust  and verily  not only the simpletons then say   should
not everything  stand still  

 fundamentally standeth everything still   that is an appropriate winter
doctrine  good cheer for an unproductive period  a great comfort for
winter sleepers and fireside loungers 

 fundamentally standeth everything still     but contrary thereto 
preacheth the thawing wind 

the thawing wind  a bullock  which is no ploughing bullock  a furious
bullock  a destroyer  which with angry horns breaketh the ice  the ice
however  breaketh gangways 

o my brethren  is not everything at present in flux  have not all
railings and gangways fallen into the water  who would still hold on to
 good  and  evil  

 woe to us  hail to us  the thawing wind bloweth    thus preach  my
brethren  through all the streets 

9 

there is an old illusion  it is called good and evil  around soothsayers
and astrologers hath hitherto revolved the orbit of this illusion 

once did one believe in soothsayers and astrologers  and therefore did
one believe   everything is fate  thou shalt  for thou must  

then again did one distrust all soothsayers and astrologers  and
therefore did one believe   everything is freedom  thou canst  for thou
willest  

o my brethren  concerning the stars and the future there hath hitherto
been only illusion  and not knowledge  and therefore concerning good and
evil there hath hitherto been only illusion and not knowledge 

10 

 thou shalt not rob  thou shalt not slay    such precepts were once
called holy  before them did one bow the knee and the head  and take off
one s shoes 

but i ask you  where have there ever been better robbers and slayers in
the world than such holy precepts 

is there not even in all life  robbing and slaying  and for such
precepts to be called holy  was not truth itself thereby  slain 

  or was it a sermon of death that called holy what contradicted and
dissuaded from life   o my brethren  break up  break up for me the old
tables 

11 

it is my sympathy with all the past that i see it is abandoned   

  abandoned to the favour  the spirit and the madness of every
generation that cometh  and reinterpreteth all that hath been as its
bridge 

a great potentate might arise  an artful prodigy  who with approval and
disapproval could strain and constrain all the past  until it became for
him a bridge  a harbinger  a herald  and a cock crowing 

this however is the other danger  and mine other sympathy   he who is
of the populace  his thoughts go back to his grandfather   with his
grandfather  however  doth time cease 

thus is all the past abandoned  for it might some day happen for the
populace to become master  and drown all time in shallow waters 

therefore  o my brethren  a new nobility is needed  which shall be the
adversary of all populace and potentate rule  and shall inscribe anew
the word  noble  on new tables 

for many noble ones are needed  and many kinds of noble ones  for a new
nobility  or  as i once said in parable   that is just divinity  that
there are gods  but no god  

12 

o my brethren  i consecrate you and point you to a new nobility  ye
shall become procreators and cultivators and sowers of the future   

  verily  not to a nobility which ye could purchase like traders with
traders  gold  for little worth is all that hath its price 

let it not be your honour henceforth whence ye come  but whither ye go 
your will and your feet which seek to surpass you  let these be your new
honour 

verily  not that ye have served a prince  of what account are princes
now   nor that ye have become a bulwark to that which standeth  that it
may stand more firmly 

not that your family have become courtly at courts  and that ye have
learned  gay coloured  like the flamingo  to stand long hours in shallow
pools 

 for ability to stand is a merit in courtiers  and all courtiers believe
that unto blessedness after death pertaineth  permission to sit  

nor even that a spirit called holy  led your forefathers into promised
lands  which i do not praise  for where the worst of all trees grew  the
cross   in that land there is nothing to praise   

  and verily  wherever this  holy spirit  led its knights  always in
such campaigns did  goats and geese  and wryheads and guyheads run
foremost   

o my brethren  not backward shall your nobility gaze  but outward 
exiles shall ye be from all fatherlands and forefather lands 

your children s land shall ye love  let this love be your new
nobility   the undiscovered in the remotest seas  for it do i bid your
sails search and search 

unto your children shall ye make amends for being the children of your
fathers  all the past shall ye thus redeem  this new table do i place
over you 

13 

 why should one live  all is vain  to live  that is to thrash straw  to
live  that is to burn oneself and yet not get warm    

such ancient babbling still passeth for  wisdom   because it is old 
however  and smelleth mustily  therefore is it the more honoured  even
mould ennobleth   

children might thus speak  they shun the fire because it hath burnt
them  there is much childishness in the old books of wisdom 

and he who ever  thrasheth straw   why should he be allowed to rail at
thrashing  such a fool one would have to muzzle 

such persons sit down to the table and bring nothing with them  not even
good hunger   and then do they rail   all is vain  

but to eat and drink well  my brethren  is verily no vain art  break up 
break up for me the tables of the never joyous ones 

14 

 to the clean are all things clean   thus say the people  i  however 
say unto you  to the swine all things become swinish 

therefore preach the visionaries and bowed heads  whose hearts are also
bowed down    the world itself is a filthy monster  

for these are all unclean spirits  especially those  however  who have
no peace or rest  unless they see the world from the backside  the
backworldsmen 

to those do i say it to the face  although it sound unpleasantly  the
world resembleth man  in that it hath a backside   so much is true 

there is in the world much filth  so much is true  but the world itself
is not therefore a filthy monster 

there is wisdom in the fact that much in the world smelleth badly 
loathing itself createth wings  and fountain divining powers 

in the best there is still something to loathe  and the best is still
something that must be surpassed   

o my brethren  there is much wisdom in the fact that much filth is in
the world   

15 

such sayings did i hear pious backworldsmen speak to their consciences 
and verily without wickedness or guile   although there is nothing more
guileful in the world  or more wicked 

 let the world be as it is  raise not a finger against it  

 let whoever will choke and stab and skin and scrape the people  raise
not a finger against it  thereby will they learn to renounce the world  

 and thine own reason  this shalt thou thyself stifle and choke  for it
is a reason of this world   thereby wilt thou learn thyself to renounce
the world    

  shatter  shatter  o my brethren  those old tables of the pious  tatter
the maxims of the world maligners   

16 

 he who learneth much unlearneth all violent cravings   that do people
now whisper to one another in all the dark lanes 

 wisdom wearieth  nothing is worth while  thou shalt not crave    this
new table found i hanging even in the public markets 

break up for me  o my brethren  break up also that new table  the
weary o  the world put it up  and the preachers of death and the jailer 
for lo  it is also a sermon for slavery   

because they learned badly and not the best  and everything too early
and everything too fast  because they ate badly  from thence hath
resulted their ruined stomach   

  for a ruined stomach  is their spirit  it persuadeth to death  for
verily  my brethren  the spirit is a stomach 

life is a well of delight  but to him in whom the ruined stomach
speaketh  the father of affliction  all fountains are poisoned 

to discern  that is delight to the lion willed  but he who hath become
weary  is himself merely  willed   with him play all the waves 

and such is always the nature of weak men  they lose themselves on their
way  and at last asketh their weariness   why did we ever go on the way 
all is indifferent  

to them soundeth it pleasant to have preached in their ears   nothing is
worth while  ye shall not will   that  however  is a sermon for slavery 

o my brethren  a fresh blustering wind cometh zarathustra unto all
way weary ones  many noses will he yet make sneeze 

even through walls bloweth my free breath  and in into prisons and
imprisoned spirits 

willing emancipateth  for willing is creating  so do i teach  and only
for creating shall ye learn 

and also the learning shall ye learn only from me  the learning
well   he who hath ears let him hear 

17 

there standeth the boat  thither goeth it over  perhaps into vast
nothingness  but who willeth to enter into this  perhaps  

none of you want to enter into the death boat  how should ye then be
world weary ones 

world weary ones  and have not even withdrawn from the earth  eager
did i ever find you for the earth  amorous still of your own
earth weariness 

not in vain doth your lip hang down   a small worldly wish still sitteth
thereon  and in your eye  floateth there not a cloudlet of unforgotten
earthly bliss 

there are on the earth many good inventions  some useful  some pleasant 
for their sake is the earth to be loved 

and many such good inventions are there  that they are like woman s
breasts  useful at the same time  and pleasant 

ye world weary ones  however  ye earth idlers  you  shall one beat with
stripes  with stripes shall one again make you sprightly limbs 

for if ye be not invalids  or decrepit creatures  of whom the earth is
weary  then are ye sly sloths  or dainty  sneaking pleasure cats  and if
ye will not again run gaily  then shall ye  pass away 

to the incurable shall one not seek to be a physician  thus teacheth
zarathustra   so shall ye pass away 

but more courage is needed to make an end than to make a new verse  that
do all physicians and poets know well   

18 

o my brethren  there are tables which weariness framed  and tables
which slothfulness framed  corrupt slothfulness  although they speak
similarly  they want to be heard differently   

see this languishing one  only a span breadth is he from his goal  but
from weariness hath he lain down obstinately in the dust  this brave
one 

from weariness yawneth he at the path  at the earth  at the goal  and at
himself  not a step further will he go   this brave one 

now gloweth the sun upon him  and the dogs lick at his sweat  but he
lieth there in his obstinacy and preferreth to languish   

  a span breadth from his goal  to languish  verily  ye will have to
drag him into his heaven by the hair of his head  this hero 

better still that ye let him lie where he hath lain down  that sleep may
come unto him  the comforter  with cooling patter rain 

let him lie  until of his own accord he awakeneth   until of his own
accord he repudiateth all weariness  and what weariness hath taught
through him 

only  my brethren  see that ye scare the dogs away from him  the idle
skulkers  and all the swarming vermin   

  all the swarming vermin of the  cultured   that  feast on the sweat of
every hero   

19 

i form circles around me and holy boundaries  ever fewer ascend with
me ever higher mountains  i build a mountain range out of ever holier
mountains   

but wherever ye would ascend with me  o my brethren  take care lest a
parasite ascend with you 

a parasite  that is a reptile  a creeping  cringing reptile  that trieth
to fatten on your infirm and sore places 

and this is its art  it divineth where ascending souls are weary  in
your trouble and dejection  in your sensitive modesty  doth it build its
loathsome nest 

where the strong are weak  where the noble are all too gentle  there
buildeth it its loathsome nest  the parasite liveth where the great have
small sore places 

what is the highest of all species of being  and what is the lowest 
the parasite is the lowest species  he  however  who is of the highest
species feedeth most parasites 

for the soul which hath the longest ladder  and can go deepest down  how
could there fail to be most parasites upon it   

  the most comprehensive soul  which can run and stray and rove furthest
in itself  the most necessary soul  which out of joy flingeth itself
into chance   

  the soul in being  which plungeth into becoming  the possessing soul 
which seeketh to attain desire and longing   

  the soul fleeing from itself  which overtaketh itself in the widest
circuit  the wisest soul  unto which folly speaketh most sweetly   

  the soul most self loving  in which all things have their current and
counter current  their ebb and their flow   oh  how could the loftiest
soul fail to have the worst parasites 

20 

o my brethren  am i then cruel  but i say  what falleth  that shall one
also push 

everything of to day  it falleth  it decayeth  who would preserve it 
but i  i wish also to push it 

know ye the delight which rolleth stones into precipitous depths   those
men of to day  see just how they roll into my depths 

a prelude am i to better players  o my brethren  an example  do
according to mine example 

and him whom ye do not teach to fly  teach i pray you  to fall faster   

21 

i love the brave  but it is not enough to be a swordsman   one must also
know whereon to use swordsmanship 

and often is it greater bravery to keep quiet and pass by  that thereby
one may reserve oneself for a worthier foe 

ye shall only have foes to be hated  but not foes to be despised  ye
must be proud of your foes  thus have i already taught 

for the worthier foe  o my brethren  shall ye reserve yourselves 
therefore must ye pass by many a one   

  especially many of the rabble  who din your ears with noise about
people and peoples 

keep your eye clear of their for and against  there is there much right 
much wrong  he who looketh on becometh wroth 

therein viewing  therein hewing  they are the same thing  therefore
depart into the forests and lay your sword to sleep 

go your ways  and let the people and peoples go theirs   gloomy ways 
verily  on which not a single hope glinteth any more 

let there the trader rule  where all that still glittereth is  traders 
gold  it is the time of kings no longer  that which now calleth itself
the people is unworthy of kings 

see how these peoples themselves now do just like the traders  they pick
up the smallest advantage out of all kinds of rubbish 

they lay lures for one another  they lure things out of one
another   that they call  good neighbourliness   o blessed remote period
when a people said to itself   i will be  master over peoples  

for  my brethren  the best shall rule  the best also willeth to rule 
and where the teaching is different  there  the best is lacking 

22 

if they had  bread for nothing  alas  for what would they cry  their
maintainment  that is their true entertainment  and they shall have it
hard 

beasts of prey  are they  in their  working   there is even plundering 
in their  earning   there is even overreaching  therefore shall they
have it hard 

better beasts of prey shall they thus become  subtler  cleverer  more
man like  for man is the best beast of prey 

all the animals hath man already robbed of their virtues  that is why of
all animals it hath been hardest for man 

only the birds are still beyond him  and if man should yet learn to fly 
alas  to what height  would his rapacity fly 

23 

thus would i have man and woman  fit for war  the one  fit for
maternity  the other  both  however  fit for dancing with head and legs 

and lost be the day to us in which a measure hath not been danced  and
false be every truth which hath not had laughter along with it 

24 

your marriage arranging  see that it be not a bad arranging  ye have
arranged too hastily  so there followeth therefrom  marriage breaking 

and better marriage breaking than marriage bending 
marriage lying   thus spake a woman unto me   indeed  i broke the
marriage  but first did the marriage break  me 

the badly paired found i ever the most revengeful  they make every one
suffer for it that they no longer run singly 

on that account want i the honest ones to say to one another   we love
each other  let us see to it that we maintain our love  or shall our
pledging be blundering  

   give us a set term and a small marriage  that we may see if we are
fit for the great marriage  it is a great matter always to be twain  

thus do i counsel all honest ones  and what would be my love to the
superman  and to all that is to come  if i should counsel and speak
otherwise 

not only to propagate yourselves onwards but upwards  thereto  o my
brethren  may the garden of marriage help you 

25 

he who hath grown wise concerning old origins  lo  he will at last seek
after the fountains of the future and new origins   

o my brethren  not long will it be until new peoples shall arise and new
fountains shall rush down into new depths 

for the earthquake  it choketh up many wells  it causeth much
languishing  but it bringeth also to light inner powers and secrets 

the earthquake discloseth new fountains  in the earthquake of old
peoples new fountains burst forth 

and whoever calleth out   lo  here is a well for many thirsty ones  one
heart for many longing ones  one will for many instruments    around him
collecteth a people  that is to say  many attempting ones 

who can command  who must obey  that is there attempted  ah  with what
long seeking and solving and failing and learning and re attempting 

human society  it is an attempt  so i teach  a long seeking  it seeketh
however the ruler   

  an attempt  my brethren  and no  contract   destroy  i pray you 
destroy that word of the soft hearted and half and half 

26 

o my brethren  with whom lieth the greatest danger to the whole human
future  is it not with the good and just   

  as those who say and feel in their hearts   we already know what
is good and just  we possess it also  woe to those who still seek
thereafter 

and whatever harm the wicked may do  the harm of the good is the
harmfulest harm 

and whatever harm the world maligners may do  the harm of the good is
the harmfulest harm 

o my brethren  into the hearts of the good and just looked some one
once on a time  who said   they are the pharisees   but people did not
understand him 

the good and just themselves were not free to understand him  their
spirit was imprisoned in their good conscience  the stupidity of the
good is unfathomably wise 

it is the truth  however  that the good must be pharisees  they have no
choice 

the good must crucify him who deviseth his own virtue  that is the
truth 

the second one  however  who discovered their country  the country 
heart and soil of the good and just   it was he who asked   whom do they
hate most  

the creator  hate they most  him who breaketh the tables and old values 
the breaker   him they call the law breaker 

for the good  they cannot create  they are always the beginning of the
end   

  they crucify him who writeth new values on new tables  they sacrifice
unto themselves the future  they crucify the whole human future 

the good  they have always been the beginning of the end   

27 

o my brethren  have ye also understood this word  and what i once said
of the  last man    

with whom lieth the greatest danger to the whole human future  is it not
with the good and just 

break up  break up  i pray you  the good and just   o my brethren  have
ye understood also this word 

28 

ye flee from me  ye are frightened  ye tremble at this word 

o my brethren  when i enjoined you to break up the good  and the tables
of the good  then only did i embark man on his high seas 

and now only cometh unto him the great terror  the great outlook  the
great sickness  the great nausea  the great sea sickness 

false shores and false securities did the good teach you  in the lies of
the good were ye born and bred  everything hath been radically contorted
and distorted by the good 

but he who discovered the country of  man   discovered also the country
of  man s future   now shall ye be sailors for me  brave  patient 

keep yourselves up betimes  my brethren  learn to keep yourselves up 
the sea stormeth  many seek to raise themselves again by you 

the sea stormeth  all is in the sea  well  cheer up  ye old
seaman hearts 

what of fatherland  thither striveth our helm where our children s land
is  thitherwards  stormier than the sea  stormeth our great longing   

29 

 why so hard    said to the diamond one day the charcoal   are we then
not near relatives    

why so soft  o my brethren  thus do  i  ask you  are ye then not  my
brethren 

why so soft  so submissive and yielding  why is there so much negation
and abnegation in your hearts  why is there so little fate in your
looks 

and if ye will not be fates and inexorable ones  how can ye one day  
conquer with me 

and if your hardness will not glance and cut and chip to pieces  how can
ye one day  create with me 

for the creators are hard  and blessedness must it seem to you to press
your hand upon millenniums as upon wax   

  blessedness to write upon the will of millenniums as upon
brass   harder than brass  nobler than brass  entirely hard is only the
noblest 

this new table  o my brethren  put i up over you  become hard   

30 

o thou  my will  thou change of every need  my needfulness  preserve me
from all small victories 

thou fatedness of my soul  which i call fate  thou in me  over me 
preserve and spare me for one great fate 

and thy last greatness  my will  spare it for thy last  that thou mayest
be inexorable in thy victory  ah  who hath not succumbed to his victory 

ah  whose eye hath not bedimmed in this intoxicated twilight  ah  whose
foot hath not faltered and forgotten in victory  how to stand   

  that i may one day be ready and ripe in the great noontide  ready and
ripe like the glowing ore  the lightning bearing cloud  and the swelling
milk udder   

  ready for myself and for my most hidden will  a bow eager for its
arrow  an arrow eager for its star   

  a star  ready and ripe in its noontide  glowing  pierced  blessed  by
annihilating sun arrows   

  a sun itself  and an inexorable sun will  ready for annihilation in
victory 

o will  thou change of every need  my needfulness  spare me for one
great victory    

thus spake zarathustra 




lvii  the convalescent 

1 

one morning  not long after his return to his cave  zarathustra sprang
up from his couch like a madman  crying with a frightful voice  and
acting as if some one still lay on the couch who did not wish to rise 
zarathustra s voice also resounded in such a manner that his animals
came to him frightened  and out of all the neighbouring caves and
lurking places all the creatures slipped away  flying  fluttering 
creeping or leaping  according to their variety of foot or wing 
zarathustra  however  spake these words 

up  abysmal thought out of my depth  i am thy cock and morning dawn 
thou overslept reptile  up  up  my voice shall soon crow thee awake 

unbind the fetters of thine ears  listen  for i wish to hear thee  up 
up  there is thunder enough to make the very graves listen 

and rub the sleep and all the dimness and blindness out of thine eyes 
hear me also with thine eyes  my voice is a medicine even for those born
blind 

and once thou art awake  then shalt thou ever remain awake  it is not
my custom to awake great grandmothers out of their sleep that i may bid
them  sleep on 

thou stirrest  stretchest thyself  wheezest  up  up  not wheeze  shalt
thou   but speak unto me  zarathustra calleth thee  zarathustra the
godless 

i  zarathustra  the advocate of living  the advocate of suffering  the
advocate of the circuit  thee do i call  my most abysmal thought 

joy to me  thou comest   i hear thee  mine abyss speaketh  my lowest
depth have i turned over into the light 

joy to me  come hither  give me thy hand  ha  let be  aha   disgust 
disgust  disgust  alas to me

hardly  however  had zarathustra spoken these words  when he fell down
as one dead  and remained long as one dead  when however he again came
to himself  then was he pale and trembling  and remained lying  and for
long he would neither eat nor drink  this condition continued for seven
days  his animals  however  did not leave him day nor night  except that
the eagle flew forth to fetch food  and what it fetched and foraged 
it laid on zarathustra s couch  so that zarathustra at last lay among
yellow and red berries  grapes  rosy apples  sweet smelling herbage  and
pine cones  at his feet  however  two lambs were stretched  which the
eagle had with difficulty carried off from their shepherds 

at last  after seven days  zarathustra raised himself upon his couch 
took a rosy apple in his hand  smelt it and found its smell pleasant 
then did his animals think the time had come to speak unto him 

 o zarathustra   said they   now hast thou lain thus for seven days with
heavy eyes  wilt thou not set thyself again upon thy feet 

step out of thy cave  the world waiteth for thee as a garden  the wind
playeth with heavy fragrance which seeketh for thee  and all brooks
would like to run after thee 

all things long for thee  since thou hast remained alone for seven
days  step forth out of thy cave  all things want to be thy physicians 

did perhaps a new knowledge come to thee  a bitter  grievous knowledge 
like leavened dough layest thou  thy soul arose and swelled beyond all
its bounds    

  o mine animals  answered zarathustra  talk on thus and let me listen 
it refresheth me so to hear your talk  where there is talk  there is the
world as a garden unto me 

how charming it is that there are words and tones  are not words and
tones rainbows and seeming bridges  twixt the eternally separated 

to each soul belongeth another world  to each soul is every other soul a
back world 

among the most alike doth semblance deceive most delightfully  for the
smallest gap is most difficult to bridge over 

for me  how could there be an outside of me  there is no outside  but
this we forget on hearing tones  how delightful it is that we forget 

have not names and tones been given unto things that man may refresh
himself with them  it is a beautiful folly  speaking  therewith danceth
man over everything 

how lovely is all speech and all falsehoods of tones  with tones danceth
our love on variegated rainbows   

   o zarathustra   said then his animals   to those who think like us 
things all dance themselves  they come and hold out the hand and laugh
and flee  and return 

everything goeth  everything returneth  eternally rolleth the wheel
of existence  everything dieth  everything blossometh forth again 
eternally runneth on the year of existence 

everything breaketh  everything is integrated anew  eternally buildeth
itself the same house of existence  all things separate  all things
again greet one another  eternally true to itself remaineth the ring of
existence 

every moment beginneth existence  around every  here  rolleth the ball
 there   the middle is everywhere  crooked is the path of eternity    

  o ye wags and barrel organs  answered zarathustra  and smiled once
more  how well do ye know what had to be fulfilled in seven days   

  and how that monster crept into my throat and choked me  but i bit off
its head and spat it away from me 

and ye  ye have made a lyre lay out of it  now  however  do i lie here 
still exhausted with that biting and spitting away  still sick with mine
own salvation 

and ye looked on at it all  o mine animals  are ye also cruel  did
ye like to look at my great pain as men do  for man is the cruellest
animal 

at tragedies  bull fights  and crucifixions hath he hitherto been
happiest on earth  and when he invented his hell  behold  that was his
heaven on earth 

when the great man crieth    immediately runneth the little man thither 
and his tongue hangeth out of his mouth for very lusting  he  however 
calleth it his  pity  

the little man  especially the poet  how passionately doth he accuse
life in words  hearken to him  but do not fail to hear the delight which
is in all accusation 

such accusers of life  them life overcometh with a glance of the eye 
 thou lovest me   saith the insolent one   wait a little  as yet have i
no time for thee  

towards himself man is the cruellest animal  and in all who call
themselves  sinners  and  bearers of the cross  and  penitents   do not
overlook the voluptuousness in their plaints and accusations 

and i myself  do i thereby want to be man s accuser  ah  mine animals 
this only have i learned hitherto  that for man his baddest is necessary
for his best   

  that all that is baddest is the best power  and the hardest stone for
the highest creator  and that man must become better and badder   

not to this torture stake was i tied  that i know man is bad   but i
cried  as no one hath yet cried 

 ah  that his baddest is so very small  ah  that his best is so very
small  

the great disgust at man  it strangled me and had crept into my throat 
and what the soothsayer had presaged   all is alike  nothing is worth
while  knowledge strangleth  

a long twilight limped on before me  a fatally weary  fatally
intoxicated sadness  which spake with yawning mouth 

 eternally he returneth  the man of whom thou art weary  the small
man   so yawned my sadness  and dragged its foot and could not go to
sleep 

a cavern  became the human earth to me  its breast caved in  everything
living became to me human dust and bones and mouldering past 

my sighing sat on all human graves  and could no longer arise  my
sighing and questioning croaked and choked  and gnawed and nagged day
and night 

   ah  man returneth eternally  the small man returneth eternally  

naked had i once seen both of them  the greatest man and the smallest
man  all too like one another  all too human  even the greatest man 

all too small  even the greatest man   that was my disgust at man  and
the eternal return also of the smallest man   that was my disgust at all
existence 

ah  disgust  disgust  disgust   thus spake zarathustra  and sighed and
shuddered  for he remembered his sickness  then did his animals prevent
him from speaking further 

 do not speak further  thou convalescent    so answered his animals 
 but go out where the world waiteth for thee like a garden 

go out unto the roses  the bees  and the flocks of doves  especially 
however  unto the singing birds  to learn singing from them 

for singing is for the convalescent  the sound ones may talk  and
when the sound also want songs  then want they other songs than the
convalescent  

   o ye wags and barrel organs  do be silent   answered zarathustra  and
smiled at his animals   how well ye know what consolation i devised for
myself in seven days 

that i have to sing once more  that consolation did i devise for myself 
and this convalescence  would ye also make another lyre lay thereof  

   do not talk further   answered his animals once more   rather  thou
convalescent  prepare for thyself first a lyre  a new lyre 

for behold  o zarathustra  for thy new lays there are needed new lyres 

sing and bubble over  o zarathustra  heal thy soul with new lays  that
thou mayest bear thy great fate  which hath not yet been any one s fate 

for thine animals know it well  o zarathustra  who thou art and must
become  behold  thou art the teacher of the eternal return   that is now
thy fate 

that thou must be the first to teach this teaching  how could this great
fate not be thy greatest danger and infirmity 

behold  we know what thou teachest  that all things eternally return 
and ourselves with them  and that we have already existed times without
number  and all things with us 

thou teachest that there is a great year of becoming  a prodigy of a
great year  it must  like a sand glass  ever turn up anew  that it may
anew run down and run out   

  so that all those years are like one another in the greatest and also
in the smallest  so that we ourselves  in every great year  are like
ourselves in the greatest and also in the smallest 

and if thou wouldst now die  o zarathustra  behold  we know also how
thou wouldst then speak to thyself   but thine animals beseech thee not
to die yet 

thou wouldst speak  and without trembling  buoyant rather with bliss 
for a great weight and worry would be taken from thee  thou patientest
one   

 now do i die and disappear   wouldst thou say   and in a moment i am
nothing  souls are as mortal as bodies 

but the plexus of causes returneth in which i am intertwined   it will
again create me  i myself pertain to the causes of the eternal return 

i come again with this sun  with this earth  with this eagle  with this
serpent  not to a new life  or a better life  or a similar life 

  i come again eternally to this identical and selfsame life  in its
greatest and its smallest  to teach again the eternal return of all
things   

  to speak again the word of the great noontide of earth and man  to
announce again to man the superman 

i have spoken my word  i break down by my word  so willeth mine eternal
fate  as announcer do i succumb 

the hour hath now come for the down goer to bless himself  thus  endeth
zarathustra s down going     

when the animals had spoken these words they were silent and waited  so
that zarathustra might say something to them  but zarathustra did not
hear that they were silent  on the contrary  he lay quietly with closed
eyes like a person sleeping  although he did not sleep  for he communed
just then with his soul  the serpent  however  and the eagle  when they
found him silent in such wise  respected the great stillness around him 
and prudently retired 




lviii  the great longing 

o my soul  i have taught thee to say  to day  as  once on a time  and
 formerly   and to dance thy measure over every here and there and
yonder 

o my soul  i delivered thee from all by places  i brushed down from thee
dust and spiders and twilight 

o my soul  i washed the petty shame and the by place virtue from thee 
and persuaded thee to stand naked before the eyes of the sun 

with the storm that is called  spirit  did i blow over thy surging
sea  all clouds did i blow away from it  i strangled even the strangler
called  sin  

o my soul  i gave thee the right to say nay like the storm  and to say
yea as the open heaven saith yea  calm as the light remainest thou  and
now walkest through denying storms 

o my soul  i restored to thee liberty over the created and the
uncreated  and who knoweth  as thou knowest  the voluptuousness of the
future 

o my soul  i taught thee the contempt which doth not come like
worm eating  the great  the loving contempt  which loveth most where it
contemneth most 

o my soul  i taught thee so to persuade that thou persuadest even the
grounds themselves to thee  like the sun  which persuadeth even the sea
to its height 

o my soul  i have taken from thee all obeying and knee bending and
homage paying  i have myself given thee the names   change of need  and
 fate  

o my soul  i have given thee new names and gay coloured playthings 
i have called thee  fate  and  the circuit of circuits  and  the
navel string of time  and  the azure bell  

o my soul  to thy domain gave i all wisdom to drink  all new wines  and
also all immemorially old strong wines of wisdom 

o my soul  every sun shed i upon thee  and every night and every silence
and every longing   then grewest thou up for me as a vine 

o my soul  exuberant and heavy dost thou now stand forth  a vine with
swelling udders and full clusters of brown golden grapes   

  filled and weighted by thy happiness  waiting from superabundance  and
yet ashamed of thy waiting 

o my soul  there is nowhere a soul which could be more loving and more
comprehensive and more extensive  where could future and past be closer
together than with thee 

o my soul  i have given thee everything  and all my hands have become
empty by thee   and now  now sayest thou to me  smiling and full of
melancholy   which of us oweth thanks   

  doth the giver not owe thanks because the receiver received  is
bestowing not a necessity  is receiving not  pitying    

o my soul  i understand the smiling of thy melancholy  thine
over abundance itself now stretcheth out longing hands 

thy fulness looketh forth over raging seas  and seeketh and waiteth  the
longing of over fulness looketh forth from the smiling heaven of thine
eyes 

and verily  o my soul  who could see thy smiling and not melt
into tears  the angels themselves melt into tears through the
over graciousness of thy smiling 

thy graciousness and over graciousness  is it which will not complain
and weep  and yet  o my soul  longeth thy smiling for tears  and thy
trembling mouth for sobs 

 is not all weeping complaining  and all complaining  accusing   thus
speakest thou to thyself  and therefore  o my soul  wilt thou rather
smile than pour forth thy grief  

  than in gushing tears pour forth all thy grief concerning thy
fulness  and concerning the craving of the vine for the vintager and
vintage knife 

but wilt thou not weep  wilt thou not weep forth thy purple melancholy 
then wilt thou have to sing  o my soul   behold  i smile myself  who
foretell thee this 

  thou wilt have to sing with passionate song  until all seas turn calm
to hearken unto thy longing   

  until over calm longing seas the bark glideth  the golden marvel 
around the gold of which all good  bad  and marvellous things frisk   

  also many large and small animals  and everything that hath light
marvellous feet  so that it can run on violet blue paths   

  towards the golden marvel  the spontaneous bark  and its master  he 
however  is the vintager who waiteth with the diamond vintage knife   

  thy great deliverer  o my soul  the nameless one  for whom future
songs only will find names  and verily  already hath thy breath the
fragrance of future songs   

  already glowest thou and dreamest  already drinkest thou thirstily at
all deep echoing wells of consolation  already reposeth thy melancholy
in the bliss of future songs   

o my soul  now have i given thee all  and even my last possession  and
all my hands have become empty by thee   that i bade thee sing  behold 
that was my last thing to give 

that i bade thee sing   say now  say  which of us now  oweth thanks   
better still  however  sing unto me  sing  o my soul  and let me thank
thee   

thus spake zarathustra 




lix  the second dance song 

1 

 into thine eyes gazed i lately  o life  gold saw i gleam in thy
night eyes   my heart stood still with delight 

  a golden bark saw i gleam on darkened waters  a sinking  drinking 
reblinking  golden swing bark 

at my dance frantic foot  dost thou cast a glance  a laughing 
questioning  melting  thrown glance 

twice only movedst thou thy rattle with thy little hands  then did my
feet swing with dance fury   

my heels reared aloft  my toes they hearkened   thee they would know 
hath not the dancer his ear  in his toe 

unto thee did i spring  then fledst thou back from my bound  and towards
me waved thy fleeing  flying tresses round 

away from thee did i spring  and from thy snaky tresses  then stoodst
thou there half turned  and in thine eye caresses 

with crooked glances  dost thou teach me crooked courses  on crooked
courses learn my feet  crafty fancies 

i fear thee near  i love thee far  thy flight allureth me  thy seeking
secureth me   i suffer  but for thee  what would i not gladly bear 

for thee  whose coldness inflameth  whose hatred misleadeth  whose
flight enchaineth  whose mockery  pleadeth 

  who would not hate thee  thou great bindress  inwindress  temptress 
seekress  findress  who would not love thee  thou innocent  impatient 
wind swift  child eyed sinner 

whither pullest thou me now  thou paragon and tomboy  and now foolest
thou me fleeing  thou sweet romp dost annoy 

i dance after thee  i follow even faint traces lonely  where art thou 
give me thy hand  or thy finger only 

here are caves and thickets  we shall go astray   halt  stand still 
seest thou not owls and bats in fluttering fray 

thou bat  thou owl  thou wouldst play me foul  where are we  from the
dogs hast thou learned thus to bark and howl 

thou gnashest on me sweetly with little white teeth  thine evil eyes
shoot out upon me  thy curly little mane from underneath 

this is a dance over stock and stone  i am the hunter   wilt thou be my
hound  or my chamois anon 

now beside me  and quickly  wickedly springing  now up  and over   alas 
i have fallen myself overswinging 

oh  see me lying  thou arrogant one  and imploring grace  gladly would i
walk with thee  in some lovelier place 

  in the paths of love  through bushes variegated  quiet  trim  or there
along the lake  where gold fishes dance and swim 

thou art now a weary  there above are sheep and sun set stripes  is it
not sweet to sleep  the shepherd pipes 

thou art so very weary  i carry thee thither  let just thine arm sink 
and art thou thirsty  i should have something  but thy mouth would not
like it to drink   

  oh  that cursed  nimble  supple serpent and lurking witch  where art
thou gone  but in my face do i feel through thy hand  two spots and red
blotches itch 

i am verily weary of it  ever thy sheepish shepherd to be  thou witch 
if i have hitherto sung unto thee  now shalt thou  cry unto me 

to the rhythm of my whip shalt thou dance and cry  i forget not my
whip   not i    

2 

then did life answer me thus  and kept thereby her fine ears closed 

 o zarathustra  crack not so terribly with thy whip  thou knowest surely
that noise killeth thought   and just now there came to me such delicate
thoughts 

we are both of us genuine ne er do wells and ne er do ills  beyond
good and evil found we our island and our green meadow  we two alone 
therefore must we be friendly to each other 

and even should we not love each other from the bottom of our
hearts   must we then have a grudge against each other if we do not love
each other perfectly 

and that i am friendly to thee  and often too friendly  that knowest
thou  and the reason is that i am envious of thy wisdom  ah  this mad
old fool  wisdom 

if thy wisdom should one day run away from thee  ah  then would also my
love run away from thee quickly    

thereupon did life look thoughtfully behind and around  and said softly 
 o zarathustra  thou art not faithful enough to me 

thou lovest me not nearly so much as thou sayest  i know thou thinkest
of soon leaving me 

there is an old heavy  heavy  booming clock  it boometh by night up to
thy cave   

  when thou hearest this clock strike the hours at midnight  then
thinkest thou between one and twelve thereon  

  thou thinkest thereon  o zarathustra  i know it  of soon leaving
me    

 yea   answered i  hesitatingly   but thou knowest it also   and i
said something into her ear  in amongst her confused  yellow  foolish
tresses 

 thou knowest that  o zarathustra  that knoweth no one   

and we gazed at each other  and looked at the green meadow o er which
the cool evening was just passing  and we wept together   then  however 
was life dearer unto me than all my wisdom had ever been   

thus spake zarathustra 

3 

one 

o man  take heed 

two 

what saith deep midnight s voice indeed 

three 

 i slept my sleep  

four 

 from deepest dream i ve woke and plead   

five 

 the world is deep 

six 

 and deeper than the day could read 

seven 

 deep is its woe  

eight 

 joy  deeper still than grief can be 

nine 

 woe saith  hence  go 

ten 

 but joys all want eternity  

eleven 

 want deep profound eternity  

twelve 




lx  the seven seals 

 or the yea and amen lay  

1 

if i be a diviner and full of the divining spirit which wandereth on
high mountain ridges   twixt two seas   

wandereth  twixt the past and the future as a heavy cloud  hostile to
sultry plains  and to all that is weary and can neither die nor live 

ready for lightning in its dark bosom  and for the redeeming flash of
light  charged with lightnings which say yea  which laugh yea  ready for
divining flashes of lightning   

  blessed  however  is he who is thus charged  and verily  long must he
hang like a heavy tempest on the mountain  who shall one day kindle the
light of the future   

oh  how could i not be ardent for eternity and for the marriage ring of
rings  the ring of the return 

never yet have i found the woman by whom i should like to have children 
unless it be this woman whom i love  for i love thee  o eternity 

for i love thee  o eternity 

2 

if ever my wrath hath burst graves  shifted landmarks  or rolled old
shattered tables into precipitous depths 

if ever my scorn hath scattered mouldered words to the winds  and if i
have come like a besom to cross spiders  and as a cleansing wind to old
charnel houses 

if ever i have sat rejoicing where old gods lie buried  world blessing 
world loving  beside the monuments of old world maligners   

  for even churches and gods  graves do i love  if only heaven looketh
through their ruined roofs with pure eyes  gladly do i sit like grass
and red poppies on ruined churches  

oh  how could i not be ardent for eternity  and for the marriage ring of
rings  the ring of the return 

never yet have i found the woman by whom i should like to have children 
unless it be this woman whom i love  for i love thee  o eternity 

for i love thee  o eternity 

3 

if ever a breath hath come to me of the creative breath  and of the
heavenly necessity which compelleth even chances to dance star dances 

if ever i have laughed with the laughter of the creative lightning 
to which the long thunder of the deed followeth  grumblingly  but
obediently 

if ever i have played dice with the gods at the divine table of
the earth  so that the earth quaked and ruptured  and snorted forth
fire streams   

  for a divine table is the earth  and trembling with new creative
dictums and dice casts of the gods 

oh  how could i not be ardent for eternity  and for the marriage ring of
rings  the ring of the return 

never yet have i found the woman by whom i should like to have children 
unless it be this woman whom i love  for i love thee  o eternity 

for i love thee  o eternity 

4 

if ever i have drunk a full draught of the foaming spice  and
confection bowl in which all things are well mixed 

if ever my hand hath mingled the furthest with the nearest  fire with
spirit  joy with sorrow  and the harshest with the kindest 

if i myself am a grain of the saving salt which maketh everything in the
confection bowl mix well   

  for there is a salt which uniteth good with evil  and even the evilest
is worthy  as spicing and as final over foaming   

oh  how could i not be ardent for eternity  and for the marriage ring of
rings  the ring of the return 

never yet have i found the woman by whom i should like to have children 
unless it be this woman whom i love  for i love thee  o eternity 

for i love thee  o eternity 

5 

if i be fond of the sea  and all that is sealike  and fondest of it when
it angrily contradicteth me 

if the exploring delight be in me  which impelleth sails to the
undiscovered  if the seafarer s delight be in my delight 

if ever my rejoicing hath called out   the shore hath vanished   now
hath fallen from me the last chain  

the boundless roareth around me  far away sparkle for me space and
time   well  cheer up  old heart    

oh  how could i not be ardent for eternity  and for the marriage ring of
rings  the ring of the return 

never yet have i found the woman by whom i should like to have children 
unless it be this woman whom i love  for i love thee  o eternity 

for i love thee  o eternity 

6 

if my virtue be a dancer s virtue  and if i have often sprung with both
feet into golden emerald rapture 

if my wickedness be a laughing wickedness  at home among rose banks and
hedges of lilies 

  for in laughter is all evil present  but it is sanctified and absolved
by its own bliss   

and if it be my alpha and omega that everything heavy shall become
light  every body a dancer  and every spirit a bird  and verily  that is
my alpha and omega   

oh  how could i not be ardent for eternity  and for the marriage ring of
rings  the ring of the return 

never yet have i found the woman by whom i should like to have children 
unless it be this woman whom i love  for i love thee  o eternity 

for i love thee  o eternity 

7 

if ever i have spread out a tranquil heaven above me  and have flown
into mine own heaven with mine own pinions 

if i have swum playfully in profound luminous distances  and if my
freedom s avian wisdom hath come to me   

  thus however speaketh avian wisdom    lo  there is no above and no
below  throw thyself about   outward  backward  thou light one  sing 
speak no more 

  are not all words made for the heavy  do not all words lie to the
light ones  sing  speak no more    

oh  how could i not be ardent for eternity  and for the marriage ring of
rings  the ring of the return

fourth and last part 

ah  where in the world have there been greater follies than with the
pitiful  and what in the world hath caused more suffering than the
follies of the pitiful 

woe unto all loving ones who have not an elevation which is above their
pity 

thus spake the devil unto me  once on a time   even god hath his hell 
it is his love for man  

and lately did i hear him say these words   god is dead  of his pity for
man hath god died    zarathustra  ii    the pitiful  




lxi  the honey sacrifice 

  and again passed moons and years over zarathustra s soul  and he
heeded it not  his hair  however  became white  one day when he sat on
a stone in front of his cave  and gazed calmly into the distance  one
there gazeth out on the sea  and away beyond sinuous abysses   then went
his animals thoughtfully round about him  and at last set themselves in
front of him 

 o zarathustra   said they   gazest thou out perhaps for thy
happiness     of what account is my happiness   answered he   i have
long ceased to strive any more for happiness  i strive for my work     o
zarathustra   said the animals once more   that sayest thou as one
who hath overmuch of good things  liest thou not in a sky blue lake of
happiness     ye wags   answered zarathustra  and smiled   how well did
ye choose the simile  but ye know also that my happiness is heavy  and
not like a fluid wave of water  it presseth me and will not leave me 
and is like molten pitch    

then went his animals again thoughtfully around him  and placed
themselves once more in front of him   o zarathustra   said they   it is
consequently for that reason that thou thyself always becometh yellower
and darker  although thy hair looketh white and flaxen  lo  thou sittest
in thy pitch     what do ye say  mine animals   said zarathustra 
laughing   verily i reviled when i spake of pitch  as it happeneth with
me  so is it with all fruits that turn ripe  it is the honey in my veins
that maketh my blood thicker  and also my soul stiller     so will it
be  o zarathustra   answered his animals  and pressed up to him   but
wilt thou not to day ascend a high mountain  the air is pure  and to day
one seeth more of the world than ever     yea  mine animals   answered
he   ye counsel admirably and according to my heart  i will to day
ascend a high mountain  but see that honey is there ready to hand 
yellow  white  good  ice cool  golden comb honey  for know that when
aloft i will make the honey sacrifice    

when zarathustra  however  was aloft on the summit  he sent his animals
home that had accompanied him  and found that he was now alone   then he
laughed from the bottom of his heart  looked around him  and spake thus 

that i spake of sacrifices and honey sacrifices  it was merely a ruse
in talking and verily  a useful folly  here aloft can i now speak freer
than in front of mountain caves and anchorites  domestic animals 

what to sacrifice  i squander what is given me  a squanderer with a
thousand hands  how could i call that  sacrificing 

and when i desired honey i only desired bait  and sweet mucus and
mucilage  for which even the mouths of growling bears  and strange 
sulky  evil birds  water 

  the best bait  as huntsmen and fishermen require it  for if the world
be as a gloomy forest of animals  and a pleasure ground for all wild
huntsmen  it seemeth to me rather  and preferably  a fathomless  rich
sea 

  a sea full of many hued fishes and crabs  for which even the gods
might long  and might be tempted to become fishers in it  and casters of
nets   so rich is the world in wonderful things  great and small 

especially the human world  the human sea   towards it do i now throw
out my golden angle rod and say  open up  thou human abyss 

open up  and throw unto me thy fish and shining crabs  with my best bait
shall i allure to myself to day the strangest human fish 

  my happiness itself do i throw out into all places far and wide  twixt
orient  noontide  and occident  to see if many human fish will not learn
to hug and tug at my happiness   

until  biting at my sharp hidden hooks  they have to come up unto my
height  the motleyest abyss groundlings  to the wickedest of all fishers
of men 

for this am i from the heart and from the beginning  drawing 
hither drawing  upward drawing  upbringing  a drawer  a trainer  a
training master  who not in vain counselled himself once on a time 
 become what thou art  

thus may men now come up to me  for as yet do i await the signs that it
is time for my down going  as yet do i not myself go down  as i must do 
amongst men 

therefore do i here wait  crafty and scornful upon high mountains 
no impatient one  no patient one  rather one who hath even unlearnt
patience   because he no longer  suffereth  

for my fate giveth me time  it hath forgotten me perhaps  or doth it sit
behind a big stone and catch flies 

and verily  i am well disposed to mine eternal fate  because it doth not
hound and hurry me  but leaveth me time for merriment and mischief  so
that i have to day ascended this high mountain to catch fish 

did ever any one catch fish upon high mountains  and though it be a
folly what i here seek and do  it is better so than that down below i
should become solemn with waiting  and green and yellow  

  a posturing wrath snorter with waiting  a holy howl storm from
the mountains  an impatient one that shouteth down into the valleys 
 hearken  else i will scourge you with the scourge of god  

not that i would have a grudge against such wrathful ones on that
account  they are well enough for laughter to me  impatient must they
now be  those big alarm drums  which find a voice now or never 

myself  however  and my fate  we do not talk to the present  neither
do we talk to the never  for talking we have patience and time and more
than time  for one day must it yet come  and may not pass by 

what must one day come and may not pass by  our great hazar  that is
to say  our great  remote human kingdom  the zarathustra kingdom of a
thousand years  

how remote may such  remoteness  be  what doth it concern me  but on
that account it is none the less sure unto me    with both feet stand i
secure on this ground 

  on an eternal ground  on hard primary rock  on this highest  hardest 
primary mountain ridge  unto which all winds come  as unto the
storm parting  asking where  and whence  and whither 

here laugh  laugh  my hearty  healthy wickedness  from high mountains
cast down thy glittering scorn laughter  allure for me with thy
glittering the finest human fish 

and whatever belongeth unto me in all seas  my in and for me in all
things  fish that out for me  bring that up to me  for that do i wait 
the wickedest of all fish catchers 

out  out  my fishing hook  in and down  thou bait of my happiness  drip
thy sweetest dew  thou honey of my heart  bite  my fishing hook  into
the belly of all black affliction 

look out  look out  mine eye  oh  how many seas round about me  what
dawning human futures  and above me  what rosy red stillness  what
unclouded silence 




lxii  the cry of distress 

the next day sat zarathustra again on the stone in front of his cave 
whilst his animals roved about in the world outside to bring home new
food   also new honey  for zarathustra had spent and wasted the old
honey to the very last particle  when he thus sat  however  with a
stick in his hand  tracing the shadow of his figure on the earth  and
reflecting  verily  not upon himself and his shadow   all at once he
startled and shrank back  for he saw another shadow beside his own 
and when he hastily looked around and stood up  behold  there stood the
soothsayer beside him  the same whom he had once given to eat and drink
at his table  the proclaimer of the great weariness  who taught   all is
alike  nothing is worth while  the world is without meaning  knowledge
strangleth   but his face had changed since then  and when zarathustra
looked into his eyes  his heart was startled once more  so much evil
announcement and ashy grey lightnings passed over that countenance 

the soothsayer  who had perceived what went on in zarathustra s soul 
wiped his face with his hand  as if he would wipe out the impression 
the same did also zarathustra  and when both of them had thus silently
composed and strengthened themselves  they gave each other the hand  as
a token that they wanted once more to recognise each other 

 welcome hither   said zarathustra   thou soothsayer of the great
weariness  not in vain shalt thou once have been my messmate and guest 
eat and drink also with me to day  and forgive it that a cheerful old
man sitteth with thee at table     a cheerful old man   answered the
soothsayer  shaking his head   but whoever thou art  or wouldst be  o
zarathustra  thou hast been here aloft the longest time   in a little
while thy bark shall no longer rest on dry land     do i then rest
on dry land    asked zarathustra  laughing    the waves around thy
mountain   answered the soothsayer   rise and rise  the waves of great
distress and affliction  they will soon raise thy bark also and carry
thee away    thereupon was zarathustra silent and wondered    dost thou
still hear nothing   continued the soothsayer   doth it not rush and
roar out of the depth    zarathustra was silent once more and listened 
then heard he a long  long cry  which the abysses threw to one another
and passed on  for none of them wished to retain it  so evil did it
sound 

 thou ill announcer   said zarathustra at last   that is a cry of
distress  and the cry of a man  it may come perhaps out of a black sea 
but what doth human distress matter to me  my last sin which hath been
reserved for me   knowest thou what it is called  

   pity   answered the soothsayer from an overflowing heart  and raised
both his hands aloft   o zarathustra  i have come that i may seduce thee
to thy last sin    

and hardly had those words been uttered when there sounded the cry
once more  and longer and more alarming than before  also much nearer 
 hearest thou  hearest thou  o zarathustra   called out the soothsayer 
 the cry concerneth thee  it calleth thee  come  come  come  it is time 
it is the highest time    

zarathustra was silent thereupon  confused and staggered  at last he
asked  like one who hesitateth in himself   and who is it that there
calleth me  

 but thou knowest it  certainly   answered the soothsayer warmly   why
dost thou conceal thyself  it is the higher man that crieth for thee  

 the higher man   cried zarathustra  horror stricken   what wanteth he 
what wanteth he  the higher man  what wanteth he here    and his skin
covered with perspiration 

the soothsayer  however  did not heed zarathustra s alarm  but listened
and listened in the downward direction  when  however  it had been still
there for a long while  he looked behind  and saw zarathustra standing
trembling 

 o zarathustra   he began  with sorrowful voice   thou dost not stand
there like one whose happiness maketh him giddy  thou wilt have to dance
lest thou tumble down 

but although thou shouldst dance before me  and leap all thy side leaps 
no one may say unto me   behold  here danceth the last joyous man  

in vain would any one come to this height who sought him here  caves
would he find  indeed  and back caves  hiding places for hidden ones 
but not lucky mines  nor treasure chambers  nor new gold veins of
happiness 

happiness  how indeed could one find happiness among such buried alive
and solitary ones  must i yet seek the last happiness on the happy
isles  and far away among forgotten seas 

but all is alike  nothing is worth while  no seeking is of service 
there are no longer any happy isles    

thus sighed the soothsayer  with his last sigh  however  zarathustra
again became serene and assured  like one who hath come out of a deep
chasm into the light   nay  nay  three times nay   exclaimed he with a
strong voice  and stroked his beard   that do i know better  there are
still happy isles  silence thereon  thou sighing sorrow sack 

cease to splash thereon  thou rain cloud of the forenoon  do i not
already stand here wet with thy misery  and drenched like a dog 

now do i shake myself and run away from thee  that i may again become
dry  thereat mayest thou not wonder  do i seem to thee discourteous 
here however is my court 

but as regards the higher man  well  i shall seek him at once in those
forests  from thence came his cry  perhaps he is there hard beset by an
evil beast 

he is in my domain  therein shall he receive no scath  and verily  there
are many evil beasts about me    

with those words zarathustra turned around to depart  then said the
soothsayer   o zarathustra  thou art a rogue 

i know it well  thou wouldst fain be rid of me  rather wouldst thou run
into the forest and lay snares for evil beasts 

but what good will it do thee  in the evening wilt thou have me again 
in thine own cave will i sit  patient and heavy like a block  and wait
for thee  

 so be it   shouted back zarathustra  as he went away   and what is mine
in my cave belongeth also unto thee  my guest 

shouldst thou however find honey therein  well  just lick it up  thou
growling bear  and sweeten thy soul  for in the evening we want both to
be in good spirits 

  in good spirits and joyful  because this day hath come to an end  and
thou thyself shalt dance to my lays  as my dancing bear 

thou dost not believe this  thou shakest thy head  well  cheer up  old
bear  but i also  am a soothsayer  

thus spake zarathustra 




lxiii  talk with the kings 

1 

ere zarathustra had been an hour on his way in the mountains and
forests  he saw all at once a strange procession  right on the path
which he was about to descend came two kings walking  bedecked with
crowns and purple girdles  and variegated like flamingoes  they drove
before them a laden ass   what do these kings want in my domain   said
zarathustra in astonishment to his heart  and hid himself hastily behind
a thicket  when however the kings approached to him  he said half aloud 
like one speaking only to himself   strange  strange  how doth this
harmonise  two kings do i see  and only one ass  

thereupon the two kings made a halt  they smiled and looked towards the
spot whence the voice proceeded  and afterwards looked into each other s
faces   such things do we also think among ourselves   said the king on
the right   but we do not utter them  

the king on the left  however  shrugged his shoulders and answered 
 that may perhaps be a goat herd  or an anchorite who hath lived too
long among rocks and trees  for no society at all spoileth also good
manners  

 good manners   replied angrily and bitterly the other king   what
then do we run out of the way of  is it not  good manners   our  good
society  

better  verily  to live among anchorites and goat herds  than with
our gilded  false  over rouged populace  though it call itself  good
society  

  though it call itself  nobility   but there all is false and foul 
above all the blood  thanks to old evil diseases and worse curers 

the best and dearest to me at present is still a sound peasant  coarse 
artful  obstinate and enduring  that is at present the noblest type 

the peasant is at present the best  and the peasant type should be
master  but it is the kingdom of the populace  i no longer allow
anything to be imposed upon me  the populace  however  that meaneth 
hodgepodge 

populace hodgepodge  therein is everything mixed with everything  saint
and swindler  gentleman and jew  and every beast out of noah s ark 

good manners  everything is false and foul with us  no one knoweth any
longer how to reverence  it is that precisely that we run away from 
they are fulsome obtrusive dogs  they gild palm leaves 

this loathing choketh me  that we kings ourselves have become false 
draped and disguised with the old faded pomp of our ancestors 
show pieces for the stupidest  the craftiest  and whosoever at present
trafficketh for power 

we are not the first men  and have nevertheless to stand for them  of
this imposture have we at last become weary and disgusted 

from the rabble have we gone out of the way  from all those bawlers and
scribe blowflies  from the trader stench  the ambition fidgeting  the
bad breath    fie  to live among the rabble 

  fie  to stand for the first men among the rabble  ah  loathing 
loathing  loathing  what doth it now matter about us kings    

 thine old sickness seizeth thee   said here the king on the left   thy
loathing seizeth thee  my poor brother  thou knowest  however  that some
one heareth us  

immediately thereupon  zarathustra  who had opened ears and eyes to this
talk  rose from his hiding place  advanced towards the kings  and thus
began 

 he who hearkeneth unto you  he who gladly hearkeneth unto you  is
called zarathustra 

i am zarathustra who once said   what doth it now matter about kings  
forgive me  i rejoiced when ye said to each other   what doth it matter
about us kings  

here  however  is my domain and jurisdiction  what may ye be seeking in
my domain  perhaps  however  ye have found on your way what  i  seek 
namely  the higher man  

when the kings heard this  they beat upon their breasts and said with
one voice   we are recognised 

with the sword of thine utterance severest thou the thickest darkness of
our hearts  thou hast discovered our distress  for lo  we are on our way
to find the higher man  

  the man that is higher than we  although we are kings  to him do we
convey this ass  for the highest man shall also be the highest lord on
earth 

there is no sorer misfortune in all human destiny  than when the mighty
of the earth are not also the first men  then everything becometh false
and distorted and monstrous 

and when they are even the last men  and more beast than man  then
riseth and riseth the populace in honour  and at last saith even the
populace virtue   lo  i alone am virtue     

what have i just heard  answered zarathustra  what wisdom in kings  i
am enchanted  and verily  i have already promptings to make a rhyme
thereon   

  even if it should happen to be a rhyme not suited for every one s
ears  i unlearned long ago to have consideration for long ears  well
then  well now 

 here  however  it happened that the ass also found utterance  it said
distinctly and with malevolence  y e a  

 twas once  methinks year one of our blessed lord   drunk without wine 
the sybil thus deplored    how ill things go  decline  decline  ne er
sank the world so low  rome now hath turned harlot and harlot stew 
rome s caesar a beast  and god  hath turned jew 

2 

with those rhymes of zarathustra the kings were delighted  the king on
the right  however  said   o zarathustra  how well it was that we set
out to see thee 

for thine enemies showed us thy likeness in their mirror  there lookedst
thou with the grimace of a devil  and sneeringly  so that we were afraid
of thee 

but what good did it do  always didst thou prick us anew in heart and
ear with thy sayings  then did we say at last  what doth it matter how
he look 

we must hear him  him who teacheth   ye shall love peace as a means to
new wars  and the short peace more than the long  

no one ever spake such warlike words   what is good  to be brave is
good  it is the good war that halloweth every cause  

o zarathustra  our fathers  blood stirred in our veins at such words  it
was like the voice of spring to old wine casks 

when the swords ran among one another like red spotted serpents  then
did our fathers become fond of life  the sun of every peace seemed to
them languid and lukewarm  the long peace  however  made them ashamed 

how they sighed  our fathers  when they saw on the wall brightly
furbished  dried up swords  like those they thirsted for war  for a
sword thirsteth to drink blood  and sparkleth with desire    

  when the kings thus discoursed and talked eagerly of the happiness of
their fathers  there came upon zarathustra no little desire to mock at
their eagerness  for evidently they were very peaceable kings whom he
saw before him  kings with old and refined features  but he restrained
himself   well   said he   thither leadeth the way  there lieth the
cave of zarathustra  and this day is to have a long evening  at present 
however  a cry of distress calleth me hastily away from you 

it will honour my cave if kings want to sit and wait in it  but  to be
sure  ye will have to wait long 

well  what of that  where doth one at present learn better to wait
than at courts  and the whole virtue of kings that hath remained unto
them  is it not called to day  ability to wait  

thus spake zarathustra 




lxiv  the leech 

and zarathustra went thoughtfully on  further and lower down  through
forests and past moory bottoms  as it happeneth  however  to every one
who meditateth upon hard matters  he trod thereby unawares upon a man 
and lo  there spurted into his face all at once a cry of pain  and two
curses and twenty bad invectives  so that in his fright he raised his
stick and also struck the trodden one  immediately afterwards  however 
he regained his composure  and his heart laughed at the folly he had
just committed 

 pardon me   said he to the trodden one  who had got up enraged  and had
seated himself   pardon me  and hear first of all a parable 

as a wanderer who dreameth of remote things on a lonesome highway 
runneth unawares against a sleeping dog  a dog which lieth in the sun 

  as both of them then start up and snap at each other  like deadly
enemies  those two beings mortally frightened  so did it happen unto us 

and yet  and yet  how little was lacking for them to caress each other 
that dog and that lonesome one  are they not both  lonesome ones  

   whoever thou art   said the trodden one  still enraged   thou
treadest also too nigh me with thy parable  and not only with thy foot 

lo  am i then a dog    and thereupon the sitting one got up  and pulled
his naked arm out of the swamp  for at first he had lain outstretched
on the ground  hidden and indiscernible  like those who lie in wait for
swamp game 

 but whatever art thou about   called out zarathustra in alarm  for he
saw a deal of blood streaming over the naked arm    what hath hurt thee 
hath an evil beast bit thee  thou unfortunate one  

the bleeding one laughed  still angry   what matter is it to thee   said
he  and was about to go on   here am i at home and in my province 
let him question me whoever will  to a dolt  however  i shall hardly
answer  

 thou art mistaken   said zarathustra sympathetically  and held him
fast   thou art mistaken  here thou art not at home  but in my domain 
and therein shall no one receive any hurt 

call me however what thou wilt  i am who i must be  i call myself
zarathustra 

well  up thither is the way to zarathustra s cave  it is not far   wilt
thou not attend to thy wounds at my home 

it hath gone badly with thee  thou unfortunate one  in this life  first
a beast bit thee  and then  a man trod upon thee    

when however the trodden one had heard the name of zarathustra he was
transformed   what happeneth unto me   he exclaimed   who preoccupieth
me so much in this life as this one man  namely zarathustra  and that
one animal that liveth on blood  the leech 

for the sake of the leech did i lie here by this swamp  like a fisher 
and already had mine outstretched arm been bitten ten times  when there
biteth a still finer leech at my blood  zarathustra himself 

o happiness  o miracle  praised be this day which enticed me into the
swamp  praised be the best  the livest cupping glass  that at present
liveth  praised be the great conscience leech zarathustra    

thus spake the trodden one  and zarathustra rejoiced at his words and
their refined reverential style   who art thou   asked he  and gave
him his hand   there is much to clear up and elucidate between us  but
already methinketh pure clear day is dawning  

 i am the spiritually conscientious one   answered he who was asked 
 and in matters of the spirit it is difficult for any one to take it
more rigorously  more restrictedly  and more severely than i  except him
from whom i learnt it  zarathustra himself 

better know nothing than half know many things  better be a fool on
one s own account  than a sage on other people s approbation  i  go to
the basis 

  what matter if it be great or small  if it be called swamp or sky 
a handbreadth of basis is enough for me  if it be actually basis and
ground 

  a handbreadth of basis  thereon can one stand  in the true
knowing knowledge there is nothing great and nothing small  

 then thou art perhaps an expert on the leech   asked zarathustra   and
thou investigatest the leech to its ultimate basis  thou conscientious
one  

 o zarathustra   answered the trodden one   that would be something
immense  how could i presume to do so 

that  however  of which i am master and knower  is the brain of the
leech   that is my world 

and it is also a world  forgive it  however  that my pride here findeth
expression  for here i have not mine equal  therefore said i   here am i
at home  

how long have i investigated this one thing  the brain of the leech  so
that here the slippery truth might no longer slip from me  here is my
domain 

  for the sake of this did i cast everything else aside  for the sake of
this did everything else become indifferent to me  and close beside my
knowledge lieth my black ignorance 

my spiritual conscience requireth from me that it should be so  that i
should know one thing  and not know all else  they are a loathing unto
me  all the semi spiritual  all the hazy  hovering  and visionary 

where mine honesty ceaseth  there am i blind  and want also to be blind 
where i want to know  however  there want i also to be honest  namely 
severe  rigorous  restricted  cruel and inexorable 

because thou once saidest  o zarathustra   spirit is life which itself
cutteth into life    that led and allured me to thy doctrine  and
verily  with mine own blood have i increased mine own knowledge  

   as the evidence indicateth   broke in zarathustra  for still was the
blood flowing down on the naked arm of the conscientious one  for there
had ten leeches bitten into it 

 o thou strange fellow  how much doth this very evidence teach
me  namely  thou thyself  and not all  perhaps  might i pour into thy
rigorous ear 

well then  we part here  but i would fain find thee again  up thither is
the way to my cave  to night shalt thou there be my welcome guest 

fain would i also make amends to thy body for zarathustra treading upon
thee with his feet  i think about that  just now  however  a cry of
distress calleth me hastily away from thee  

thus spake zarathustra 




lxv  the magician 

1 

when however zarathustra had gone round a rock  then saw he on the same
path  not far below him  a man who threw his limbs about like a maniac 
and at last tumbled to the ground on his belly   halt   said then
zarathustra to his heart   he there must surely be the higher man  from
him came that dreadful cry of distress   i will see if i can help him  
 when  however  he ran to the spot where the man lay on the ground 
he found a trembling old man  with fixed eyes  and in spite of all
zarathustra s efforts to lift him and set him again on his feet  it was
all in vain  the unfortunate one  also  did not seem to notice that some
one was beside him  on the contrary  he continually looked around with
moving gestures  like one forsaken and isolated from all the world 
at last  however  after much trembling  and convulsion  and
curling himself up  he began to lament thus 

     who warm th me  who lov th me still 
     give ardent fingers 
     give heartening charcoal warmers 
     prone  outstretched  trembling 
     like him  half dead and cold  whose feet one warm th  
     and shaken  ah  by unfamiliar fevers 
     shivering with sharpened  icy cold frost arrows 
     by thee pursued  my fancy 
     ineffable   recondite   sore frightening 
     thou huntsman  hind the cloud banks 
     now lightning struck by thee 
     thou mocking eye that me in darkness watcheth 
       thus do i lie 
     bend myself  twist myself  convulsed
     with all eternal torture 
     and smitten
     by thee  cruellest huntsman 
     thou unfamiliar  god   

     smite deeper 
     smite yet once more 
     pierce through and rend my heart 
     what mean th this torture
     with dull  indented arrows 
     why look st thou hither 
     of human pain not weary 
     with mischief loving  godly flash glances 
     not murder wilt thou 
     but torture  torture 
     for why  me torture 
     thou mischief loving  unfamiliar god   

     ha   ha 
     thou stealest nigh
     in midnight s gloomy hour    
     what wilt thou 
     speak 
     thou crowdst me  pressest  
     ha  now far too closely 
     thou hearst me breathing 
     thou o erhearst my heart 
     thou ever jealous one

  here  however  zarathustra could no longer restrain himself  he took
his staff and struck the wailer with all his might   stop this   cried
he to him with wrathful laughter   stop this  thou stage player  thou
false coiner  thou liar from the very heart  i know thee well 

i will soon make warm legs to thee  thou evil magician  i know well
how  to make it hot for such as thou  

   leave off   said the old man  and sprang up from the ground   strike
me no more  o zarathustra  i did it only for amusement 

that kind of thing belongeth to mine art  thee thyself  i wanted to put
to the proof when i gave this performance  and verily  thou hast well
detected me 

but thou thyself  hast given me no small proof of thyself  thou art
hard  thou wise zarathustra  hard strikest thou with thy  truths   thy
cudgel forceth from me  this truth  

   flatter not   answered zarathustra  still excited and frowning 
 thou stage player from the heart  thou art false  why speakest thou  of
truth 

thou peacock of peacocks  thou sea of vanity  what didst thou represent
before me  thou evil magician  whom was i meant to believe in when thou
wailedst in such wise  

 the penitent in spirit   said the old man   it was him  i represented 
thou thyself once devisedst this expression  

  the poet and magician who at last turneth his spirit against himself 
the transformed one who freezeth to death by his bad science and
conscience 

and just acknowledge it  it was long  o zarathustra  before thou
discoveredst my trick and lie  thou believedst in my distress when thou
heldest my head with both thy hands   

  i heard thee lament  we have loved him too little  loved him too
little   because i so far deceived thee  my wickedness rejoiced in me  

 thou mayest have deceived subtler ones than i   said zarathustra
sternly   i am not on my guard against deceivers  i have to be without
precaution  so willeth my lot 

thou  however   must deceive  so far do i know thee  thou must ever be
equivocal  trivocal  quadrivocal  and quinquivocal  even what thou hast
now confessed  is not nearly true enough nor false enough for me 

thou bad false coiner  how couldst thou do otherwise  thy very malady
wouldst thou whitewash if thou showed thyself naked to thy physician 

thus didst thou whitewash thy lie before me when thou saidst   i did
so only for amusement   there was also seriousness therein  thou art
something of a penitent in spirit 

i divine thee well  thou hast become the enchanter of all the world  but
for thyself thou hast no lie or artifice left   thou art disenchanted to
thyself 

thou hast reaped disgust as thy one truth  no word in thee is any longer
genuine  but thy mouth is so  that is to say  the disgust that cleaveth
unto thy mouth    

   who art thou at all   cried here the old magician with defiant voice 
 who dareth to speak thus unto me  the greatest man now living    and a
green flash shot from his eye at zarathustra  but immediately after he
changed  and said sadly 

 o zarathustra  i am weary of it  i am disgusted with mine arts  i am
not great  why do i dissemble  but thou knowest it well  i sought for
greatness 

a great man i wanted to appear  and persuaded many  but the lie hath
been beyond my power  on it do i collapse 

o zarathustra  everything is a lie in me  but that i collapse  this my
collapsing is genuine    

 it honoureth thee   said zarathustra gloomily  looking down with
sidelong glance   it honoureth thee that thou soughtest for greatness 
but it betrayeth thee also  thou art not great 

thou bad old magician  that is the best and the honestest thing i honour
in thee  that thou hast become weary of thyself  and hast expressed it 
 i am not great  

therein do i honour thee as a penitent in spirit  and although only for
the twinkling of an eye  in that one moment wast thou  genuine 

but tell me  what seekest thou here in my forests and rocks  and if thou
hast put thyself in my way  what proof of me wouldst thou have   

  wherein didst thou put me to the test  

thus spake zarathustra  and his eyes sparkled  but the old magician kept
silence for a while  then said he   did i put thee to the test  i  seek
only 

o zarathustra  i seek a genuine one  a right one  a simple one  an
unequivocal one  a man of perfect honesty  a vessel of wisdom  a saint
of knowledge  a great man 

knowest thou it not  o zarathustra  i seek zarathustra  

  and here there arose a long silence between them  zarathustra 
however  became profoundly absorbed in thought  so that he shut his
eyes  but afterwards coming back to the situation  he grasped the hand
of the magician  and said  full of politeness and policy 

 well  up thither leadeth the way  there is the cave of zarathustra  in
it mayest thou seek him whom thou wouldst fain find 

and ask counsel of mine animals  mine eagle and my serpent  they shall
help thee to seek  my cave however is large 

i myself  to be sure  i have as yet seen no great man  that which is
great  the acutest eye is at present insensible to it  it is the kingdom
of the populace 

many a one have i found who stretched and inflated himself  and the
people cried   behold  a great man   but what good do all bellows do 
the wind cometh out at last 

at last bursteth the frog which hath inflated itself too long  then
cometh out the wind  to prick a swollen one in the belly  i call good
pastime  hear that  ye boys 

our to day is of the populace  who still knoweth what is great and what
is small  who could there seek successfully for greatness  a fool only 
it succeedeth with fools 

thou seekest for great men  thou strange fool  who taught that to thee 
is to day the time for it  oh  thou bad seeker  why dost thou  tempt
me    

thus spake zarathustra  comforted in his heart  and went laughing on his
way 




lxvi  out of service 

not long  however  after zarathustra had freed himself from the
magician  he again saw a person sitting beside the path which he
followed  namely a tall  black man  with a haggard  pale countenance 
this man grieved him exceedingly   alas   said he to his heart   there
sitteth disguised affliction  methinketh he is of the type of the
priests  what do they want in my domain 

what  hardly have i escaped from that magician  and must another
necromancer again run across my path   

  some sorcerer with laying on of hands  some sombre wonder worker by
the grace of god  some anointed world maligner  whom  may the devil
take 

but the devil is never at the place which would be his right place  he
always cometh too late  that cursed dwarf and club foot    

thus cursed zarathustra impatiently in his heart  and considered how
with averted look he might slip past the black man  but behold  it came
about otherwise  for at the same moment had the sitting one already
perceived him  and not unlike one whom an unexpected happiness
overtaketh  he sprang to his feet  and went straight towards
zarathustra 

 whoever thou art  thou traveller   said he   help a strayed one  a
seeker  an old man  who may here easily come to grief 

the world here is strange to me  and remote  wild beasts also did i hear
howling  and he who could have given me protection  he is himself no
more 

i was seeking the pious man  a saint and an anchorite  who  alone in his
forest  had not yet heard of what all the world knoweth at present  

 what doth all the world know at present   asked zarathustra   perhaps
that the old god no longer liveth  in whom all the world once believed  

 thou sayest it   answered the old man sorrowfully   and i served that
old god until his last hour 

now  however  am i out of service  without master  and yet not free 
likewise am i no longer merry even for an hour  except it be in
recollections 

therefore did i ascend into these mountains  that i might finally have
a festival for myself once more  as becometh an old pope and
church father  for know it  that i am the last pope   a festival of
pious recollections and divine services 

now  however  is he himself dead  the most pious of men  the saint in
the forest  who praised his god constantly with singing and mumbling 

he himself found i no longer when i found his cot  but two wolves found
i therein  which howled on account of his death   for all animals loved
him  then did i haste away 

had i thus come in vain into these forests and mountains  then did my
heart determine that i should seek another  the most pious of all
those who believe not in god    my heart determined that i should seek
zarathustra  

thus spake the hoary man  and gazed with keen eyes at him who stood
before him  zarathustra however seized the hand of the old pope and
regarded it a long while with admiration 

 lo  thou venerable one   said he then   what a fine and long hand  that
is the hand of one who hath ever dispensed blessings  now  however  doth
it hold fast him whom thou seekest  me  zarathustra 

it is i  the ungodly zarathustra  who saith   who is ungodlier than i 
that i may enjoy his teaching     

thus spake zarathustra  and penetrated with his glances the thoughts and
arrear thoughts of the old pope  at last the latter began 

 he who most loved and possessed him hath now also lost him most   

  lo  i myself am surely the most godless of us at present  but who
could rejoice at that    

   thou servedst him to the last   asked zarathustra thoughtfully  after
a deep silence   thou knowest how he died  is it true what they say 
that sympathy choked him 

  that he saw how man hung on the cross  and could not endure it   that
his love to man became his hell  and at last his death    

the old pope however did not answer  but looked aside timidly  with a
painful and gloomy expression 

 let him go   said zarathustra  after prolonged meditation  still
looking the old man straight in the eye 

 let him go  he is gone  and though it honoureth thee that thou speakest
only in praise of this dead one  yet thou knowest as well as i who he
was  and that he went curious ways  

 to speak before three eyes   said the old pope cheerfully  he was blind
of one eye    in divine matters i am more enlightened than zarathustra
himself  and may well be so 

my love served him long years  my will followed all his will  a good
servant  however  knoweth everything  and many a thing even which a
master hideth from himself 

he was a hidden god  full of secrecy  verily  he did not come by his
son otherwise than by secret ways  at the door of his faith standeth
adultery 

whoever extolleth him as a god of love  doth not think highly enough of
love itself  did not that god want also to be judge  but the loving one
loveth irrespective of reward and requital 

when he was young  that god out of the orient  then was he harsh and
revengeful  and built himself a hell for the delight of his favourites 

at last  however  he became old and soft and mellow and pitiful 
more like a grandfather than a father  but most like a tottering old
grandmother 

there did he sit shrivelled in his chimney corner  fretting on account
of his weak legs  world weary  will weary  and one day he suffocated of
his all too great pity    

 thou old pope   said here zarathustra interposing   hast thou seen that
with thine eyes  it could well have happened in that way  in that way 
and also otherwise  when gods die they always die many kinds of death 

well  at all events  one way or other  he is gone  he was counter to the
taste of mine ears and eyes  worse than that i should not like to say
against him 

i love everything that looketh bright and speaketh honestly  but
he  thou knowest it  forsooth  thou old priest  there was something of
thy type in him  the priest type  he was equivocal 

he was also indistinct  how he raged at us  this wrath snorter  because
we understood him badly  but why did he not speak more clearly 

and if the fault lay in our ears  why did he give us ears that heard him
badly  if there was dirt in our ears  well  who put it in them 

too much miscarried with him  this potter who had not learned
thoroughly  that he took revenge on his pots and creations  however 
because they turned out badly  that was a sin against good taste 

there is also good taste in piety  this at last said   away with such
a god  better to have no god  better to set up destiny on one s own
account  better to be a fool  better to be god oneself   

   what do i hear   said then the old pope  with intent ears   o
zarathustra  thou art more pious than thou believest  with such an
unbelief  some god in thee hath converted thee to thine ungodliness 

is it not thy piety itself which no longer letteth thee believe in a
god  and thine over great honesty will yet lead thee even beyond good
and evil 

behold  what hath been reserved for thee  thou hast eyes and hands and
mouth  which have been predestined for blessing from eternity  one doth
not bless with the hand alone 

nigh unto thee  though thou professest to be the ungodliest one  i feel
a hale and holy odour of long benedictions  i feel glad and grieved
thereby 

let me be thy guest  o zarathustra  for a single night  nowhere on earth
shall i now feel better than with thee    

 amen  so shall it be   said zarathustra  with great astonishment   up
thither leadeth the way  there lieth the cave of zarathustra 

gladly  forsooth  would i conduct thee thither myself  thou venerable
one  for i love all pious men  but now a cry of distress calleth me
hastily away from thee 

in my domain shall no one come to grief  my cave is a good haven  and
best of all would i like to put every sorrowful one again on firm land
and firm legs 

who  however  could take thy melancholy off thy shoulders  for that i am
too weak  long  verily  should we have to wait until some one re awoke
thy god for thee 

for that old god liveth no more  he is indeed dead    

thus spake zarathustra 




lxvii  the ugliest man 

  and again did zarathustra s feet run through mountains and forests 
and his eyes sought and sought  but nowhere was he to be seen whom they
wanted to see  the sorely distressed sufferer and crier  on the whole
way  however  he rejoiced in his heart and was full of gratitude   what
good things   said he   hath this day given me  as amends for its bad
beginning  what strange interlocutors have i found 

at their words will i now chew a long while as at good corn  small
shall my teeth grind and crush them  until they flow like milk into my
soul    

when  however  the path again curved round a rock  all at once the
landscape changed  and zarathustra entered into a realm of death  here
bristled aloft black and red cliffs  without any grass  tree  or bird s
voice  for it was a valley which all animals avoided  even the beasts of
prey  except that a species of ugly  thick  green serpent came here to
die when they became old  therefore the shepherds called this valley 
 serpent death  

zarathustra  however  became absorbed in dark recollections  for it
seemed to him as if he had once before stood in this valley  and much
heaviness settled on his mind  so that he walked slowly and always more
slowly  and at last stood still  then  however  when he opened his eyes 
he saw something sitting by the wayside shaped like a man  and hardly
like a man  something nondescript  and all at once there came over
zarathustra a great shame  because he had gazed on such a thing 
blushing up to the very roots of his white hair  he turned aside his
glance  and raised his foot that he might leave this ill starred place 
then  however  became the dead wilderness vocal  for from the ground a
noise welled up  gurgling and rattling  as water gurgleth and rattleth
at night through stopped up water pipes  and at last it turned into
human voice and human speech   it sounded thus 

 zarathustra  zarathustra  read my riddle  say  say  what is the revenge
on the witness 

i entice thee back  here is smooth ice  see to it  see to it  that thy
pride doth not here break its legs 

thou thinkest thyself wise  thou proud zarathustra  read then the
riddle  thou hard nut cracker   the riddle that i am  say then  who am
 i   

  when however zarathustra had heard these words   what think ye then
took place in his soul  pity overcame him  and he sank down all at
once  like an oak that hath long withstood many tree fellers   heavily 
suddenly  to the terror even of those who meant to fell it  but
immediately he got up again from the ground  and his countenance became
stern 

 i know thee well   said he  with a brazen voice   thou art the murderer
of god  let me go 

thou couldst not endure him who beheld thee   who ever beheld thee
through and through  thou ugliest man  thou tookest revenge on this
witness  

thus spake zarathustra and was about to go  but the nondescript grasped
at a corner of his garment and began anew to gurgle and seek for words 
 stay   said he at last  

   stay  do not pass by  i have divined what axe it was that struck thee
to the ground  hail to thee  o zarathustra  that thou art again upon thy
feet 

thou hast divined  i know it well  how the man feeleth who killed
him   the murderer of god  stay  sit down here beside me  it is not to
no purpose 

to whom would i go but unto thee  stay  sit down  do not however look at
me  honour thus  mine ugliness 

they persecute me  now art thou my last refuge  not with their hatred 
not with their bailiffs   oh  such persecution would i mock at  and be
proud and cheerful 

hath not all success hitherto been with the well persecuted ones  and
he who persecuteth well learneth readily to be obsequent  when once he
is  put behind  but it is their pity  

  their pity is it from which i flee away and flee to thee  o
zarathustra  protect me  thou  my last refuge  thou sole one who
divinedst me 

  thou hast divined how the man feeleth who killed him  stay  and if
thou wilt go  thou impatient one  go not the way that i came  that way
is bad 

art thou angry with me because i have already racked language too long 
because i have already counselled thee  but know that it is i  the
ugliest man 

  who have also the largest  heaviest feet  where  i  have gone  the way
is bad  i tread all paths to death and destruction 

but that thou passedst me by in silence  that thou blushedst  i saw it
well  thereby did i know thee as zarathustra 

every one else would have thrown to me his alms  his pity  in look and
speech  but for that  i am not beggar enough  that didst thou divine 

for that i am too rich  rich in what is great  frightful  ugliest  most
unutterable  thy shame  o zarathustra  honoured me 

with difficulty did i get out of the crowd of the pitiful   that i might
find the only one who at present teacheth that  pity is obtrusive   
thyself  o zarathustra 

  whether it be the pity of a god  or whether it be human pity  it is
offensive to modesty  and unwillingness to help may be nobler than the
virtue that rusheth to do so 

that however  namely  pity  is called virtue itself at present by
all petty people   they have no reverence for great misfortune  great
ugliness  great failure 

beyond all these do i look  as a dog looketh over the backs of thronging
flocks of sheep  they are petty  good wooled  good willed  grey people 

as the heron looketh contemptuously at shallow pools  with backward bent
head  so do i look at the throng of grey little waves and wills and
souls 

too long have we acknowledged them to be right  those petty people  so
we have at last given them power as well   and now do they teach that
 good is only what petty people call good  

and  truth  is at present what the preacher spake who himself sprang
from them  that singular saint and advocate of the petty people  who
testified of himself   i  am the truth  

that immodest one hath long made the petty people greatly puffed up   he
who taught no small error when he taught   i  am the truth  

hath an immodest one ever been answered more courteously   thou 
however  o zarathustra  passedst him by  and saidst   nay  nay  three
times nay  

thou warnedst against his error  thou warnedst  the first to do
so  against pity   not every one  not none  but thyself and thy type 

thou art ashamed of the shame of the great sufferer  and verily when
thou sayest   from pity there cometh a heavy cloud  take heed  ye men  

  when thou teachest   all creators are hard  all great love is beyond
their pity   o zarathustra  how well versed dost thou seem to me in
weather signs 

thou thyself  however   warn thyself also against thy pity  for many are
on their way to thee  many suffering  doubting  despairing  drowning 
freezing ones  

i warn thee also against myself  thou hast read my best  my worst
riddle  myself  and what i have done  i know the axe that felleth thee 

but he  had to die  he looked with eyes which beheld everything   he
beheld men s depths and dregs  all his hidden ignominy and ugliness 

his pity knew no modesty  he crept into my dirtiest corners  this most
prying  over intrusive  over pitiful one had to die 

he ever beheld me  on such a witness i would have revenge  or not live
myself 

the god who beheld everything  and also man  that god had to die  man
cannot endure it that such a witness should live  

thus spake the ugliest man  zarathustra however got up  and prepared to
go on  for he felt frozen to the very bowels 

 thou nondescript   said he   thou warnedst me against thy path  as
thanks for it i praise mine to thee  behold  up thither is the cave of
zarathustra 

my cave is large and deep and hath many corners  there findeth he
that is most hidden his hiding place  and close beside it  there are
a hundred lurking places and by places for creeping  fluttering  and
hopping creatures 

thou outcast  who hast cast thyself out  thou wilt not live amongst men
and men s pity  well then  do like me  thus wilt thou learn also from
me  only the doer learneth 

and talk first and foremost to mine animals  the proudest animal and the
wisest animal  they might well be the right counsellors for us both    

thus spake zarathustra and went his way  more thoughtfully and slowly
even than before  for he asked himself many things  and hardly knew what
to answer 

 how poor indeed is man   thought he in his heart   how ugly  how
wheezy  how full of hidden shame 

they tell me that man loveth himself  ah  how great must that self love
be  how much contempt is opposed to it 

even this man hath loved himself  as he hath despised himself   a great
lover methinketh he is  and a great despiser 

no one have i yet found who more thoroughly despised himself  even that
is elevation  alas  was this perhaps the higher man whose cry i heard 

i love the great despisers  man is something that hath to be
surpassed    




lxviii  the voluntary beggar 

when zarathustra had left the ugliest man  he was chilled and felt
lonesome  for much coldness and lonesomeness came over his spirit  so
that even his limbs became colder thereby  when  however  he wandered
on and on  uphill and down  at times past green meadows  though also
sometimes over wild stony couches where formerly perhaps an impatient
brook had made its bed  then he turned all at once warmer and heartier
again 

 what hath happened unto me   he asked himself   something warm and
living quickeneth me  it must be in the neighbourhood 

already am i less alone  unconscious companions and brethren rove around
me  their warm breath toucheth my soul  

when  however  he spied about and sought for the comforters of his
lonesomeness  behold  there were kine there standing together on an
eminence  whose proximity and smell had warmed his heart  the kine 
however  seemed to listen eagerly to a speaker  and took no heed of him
who approached  when  however  zarathustra was quite nigh unto them 
then did he hear plainly that a human voice spake in the midst of the
kine  and apparently all of them had turned their heads towards the
speaker 

then ran zarathustra up speedily and drove the animals aside  for he
feared that some one had here met with harm  which the pity of the
kine would hardly be able to relieve  but in this he was deceived  for
behold  there sat a man on the ground who seemed to be persuading
the animals to have no fear of him  a peaceable man and
preacher on the mount  out of whose eyes kindness itself preached   what
dost thou seek here   called out zarathustra in astonishment 

 what do i here seek   answered he   the same that thou seekest  thou
mischief maker  that is to say  happiness upon earth 

to that end  however  i would fain learn of these kine  for i tell thee
that i have already talked half a morning unto them  and just now were
they about to give me their answer  why dost thou disturb them 

except we be converted and become as kine  we shall in no wise enter
into the kingdom of heaven  for we ought to learn from them one thing 
ruminating 

and verily  although a man should gain the whole world  and yet not
learn one thing  ruminating  what would it profit him  he would not be
rid of his affliction 

  his great affliction  that  however  is at present called disgust  who
hath not at present his heart  his mouth and his eyes full of disgust 
thou also  thou also  but behold these kine    

thus spake the preacher on the mount  and turned then his own look
towards zarathustra  for hitherto it had rested lovingly on the kine   
then  however  he put on a different expression   who is this with whom
i talk   he exclaimed frightened  and sprang up from the ground 

 this is the man without disgust  this is zarathustra himself  the
surmounter of the great disgust  this is the eye  this is the mouth 
this is the heart of zarathustra himself  

and whilst he thus spake he kissed with o erflowing eyes the hands
of him with whom he spake  and behaved altogether like one to whom a
precious gift and jewel hath fallen unawares from heaven  the kine 
however  gazed at it all and wondered 

 speak not of me  thou strange one  thou amiable one   said zarathustra 
and restrained his affection   speak to me firstly of thyself  art thou
not the voluntary beggar who once cast away great riches   

  who was ashamed of his riches and of the rich  and fled to the poorest
to bestow upon them his abundance and his heart  but they received him
not  

 but they received me not   said the voluntary beggar   thou knowest it 
forsooth  so i went at last to the animals and to those kine  

 then learnedst thou   interrupted zarathustra   how much harder it is
to give properly than to take properly  and that bestowing well is an
art  the last  subtlest master art of kindness  

 especially nowadays   answered the voluntary beggar   at present  that
is to say  when everything low hath become rebellious and exclusive and
haughty in its manner  in the manner of the populace 

for the hour hath come  thou knowest it forsooth  for the great  evil 
long  slow mob and slave insurrection  it extendeth and extendeth 

now doth it provoke the lower classes  all benevolence and petty giving 
and the overrich may be on their guard 

whoever at present drip  like bulgy bottles out of all too small
necks   of such bottles at present one willingly breaketh the necks 

wanton avidity  bilious envy  careworn revenge  populace pride  all
these struck mine eye  it is no longer true that the poor are blessed 
the kingdom of heaven  however  is with the kine  

 and why is it not with the rich   asked zarathustra temptingly  while
he kept back the kine which sniffed familiarly at the peaceful one 

 why dost thou tempt me   answered the other   thou knowest it thyself
better even than i  what was it drove me to the poorest  o zarathustra 
was it not my disgust at the richest 

  at the culprits of riches  with cold eyes and rank thoughts  who pick
up profit out of all kinds of rubbish  at this rabble that stinketh to
heaven 

  at this gilded  falsified populace  whose fathers were pickpockets 
or carrion crows  or rag pickers  with wives compliant  lewd and
forgetful   for they are all of them not far different from harlots  

populace above  populace below  what are  poor  and  rich  at present 
that distinction did i unlearn   then did i flee away further and ever
further  until i came to those kine  

thus spake the peaceful one  and puffed himself and perspired with
his words  so that the kine wondered anew  zarathustra  however  kept
looking into his face with a smile  all the time the man talked so
severely  and shook silently his head 

 thou doest violence to thyself  thou preacher on the mount  when thou
usest such severe words  for such severity neither thy mouth nor thine
eye have been given thee 

nor  methinketh  hath thy stomach either  unto it all such rage and
hatred and foaming over is repugnant  thy stomach wanteth softer things 
thou art not a butcher 

rather seemest thou to me a plant eater and a root man  perhaps thou
grindest corn  certainly  however  thou art averse to fleshly joys  and
thou lovest honey  

 thou hast divined me well   answered the voluntary beggar  with
lightened heart   i love honey  i also grind corn  for i have sought out
what tasteth sweetly and maketh pure breath 

  also what requireth a long time  a day s work and a mouth s work for
gentle idlers and sluggards 

furthest  to be sure  have those kine carried it  they have devised
ruminating and lying in the sun  they also abstain from all heavy
thoughts which inflate the heart  

   well   said zarathustra   thou shouldst also see mine animals  mine
eagle and my serpent   their like do not at present exist on earth 

behold  thither leadeth the way to my cave  be to night its guest  and
talk to mine animals of the happiness of animals   

  until i myself come home  for now a cry of distress calleth me hastily
away from thee  also  shouldst thou find new honey with me  ice cold 
golden comb honey  eat it 

now  however  take leave at once of thy kine  thou strange one  thou
amiable one  though it be hard for thee  for they are thy warmest
friends and preceptors    

   one excepted  whom i hold still dearer   answered the voluntary
beggar   thou thyself art good  o zarathustra  and better even than a
cow  

 away  away with thee  thou evil flatterer   cried zarathustra
mischievously   why dost thou spoil me with such praise and
flattery honey 

 away  away from me   cried he once more  and heaved his stick at the
fond beggar  who  however  ran nimbly away 




lxix  the shadow 

scarcely however was the voluntary beggar gone in haste  and zarathustra
again alone  when he heard behind him a new voice which called out 
 stay  zarathustra  do wait  it is myself  forsooth  o zarathustra 
myself  thy shadow   but zarathustra did not wait  for a sudden
irritation came over him on account of the crowd and the crowding in his
mountains   whither hath my lonesomeness gone   spake he 

 it is verily becoming too much for me  these mountains swarm  my
kingdom is no longer of this world  i require new mountains 

my shadow calleth me  what matter about my shadow  let it run after me 
i  run away from it  

thus spake zarathustra to his heart and ran away  but the one behind
followed after him  so that immediately there were three runners 
one after the other  namely  foremost the voluntary beggar  then
zarathustra  and thirdly  and hindmost  his shadow  but not long had
they run thus when zarathustra became conscious of his folly  and shook
off with one jerk all his irritation and detestation 

 what   said he   have not the most ludicrous things always happened to
us old anchorites and saints 

verily  my folly hath grown big in the mountains  now do i hear six old
fools  legs rattling behind one another 

but doth zarathustra need to be frightened by his shadow  also 
methinketh that after all it hath longer legs than mine  

thus spake zarathustra  and  laughing with eyes and entrails  he stood
still and turned round quickly  and behold  he almost thereby threw his
shadow and follower to the ground  so closely had the latter followed at
his heels  and so weak was he  for when zarathustra scrutinised him
with his glance he was frightened as by a sudden apparition  so slender 
swarthy  hollow and worn out did this follower appear 

 who art thou   asked zarathustra vehemently   what doest thou here  and
why callest thou thyself my shadow  thou art not pleasing unto me  

 forgive me   answered the shadow   that it is i  and if i please thee
not  well  o zarathustra  therein do i admire thee and thy good taste 

a wanderer am i  who have walked long at thy heels  always on the way 
but without a goal  also without a home  so that verily  i lack little
of being the eternally wandering jew  except that i am not eternal and
not a jew 

what  must i ever be on the way  whirled by every wind  unsettled 
driven about  o earth  thou hast become too round for me 

on every surface have i already sat  like tired dust have i fallen
asleep on mirrors and window panes  everything taketh from me  nothing
giveth  i become thin  i am almost equal to a shadow 

after thee  however  o zarathustra  did i fly and hie longest  and
though i hid myself from thee  i was nevertheless thy best shadow 
wherever thou hast sat  there sat i also 

with thee have i wandered about in the remotest  coldest worlds  like a
phantom that voluntarily haunteth winter roofs and snows 

with thee have i pushed into all the forbidden  all the worst and the
furthest  and if there be anything of virtue in me  it is that i have
had no fear of any prohibition 

with thee have i broken up whatever my heart revered  all
boundary stones and statues have i o erthrown  the most dangerous wishes
did i pursue   verily  beyond every crime did i once go 

with thee did i unlearn the belief in words and worths and in great
names  when the devil casteth his skin  doth not his name also fall
away  it is also skin  the devil himself is perhaps  skin 

 nothing is true  all is permitted   so said i to myself  into the
coldest water did i plunge with head and heart  ah  how oft did i stand
there naked on that account  like a red crab 

ah  where have gone all my goodness and all my shame and all my belief
in the good  ah  where is the lying innocence which i once possessed 
the innocence of the good and of their noble lies 

too oft  verily  did i follow close to the heels of truth  then did it
kick me on the face  sometimes i meant to lie  and behold  then only did
i hit  the truth 

too much hath become clear unto me  now it doth not concern me any more 
nothing liveth any longer that i love   how should i still love myself 

 to live as i incline  or not to live at all   so do i wish  so wisheth
also the holiest  but alas  how have  i  still  inclination 

have  i   still a goal  a haven towards which my sail is set 

a good wind  ah  he only who knoweth whither he saileth  knoweth what
wind is good  and a fair wind for him 

what still remaineth to me  a heart weary and flippant  an unstable
will  fluttering wings  a broken backbone 

this seeking for my home  o zarathustra  dost thou know that this
seeking hath been my home sickening  it eateth me up 

 where is  my home   for it do i ask and seek  and have sought  but
have not found it  o eternal everywhere  o eternal nowhere  o
eternal  in vain  

thus spake the shadow  and zarathustra s countenance lengthened at his
words   thou art my shadow   said he at last sadly 

 thy danger is not small  thou free spirit and wanderer  thou hast had a
bad day  see that a still worse evening doth not overtake thee 

to such unsettled ones as thou  seemeth at last even a prisoner blessed 
didst thou ever see how captured criminals sleep  they sleep quietly 
they enjoy their new security 

beware lest in the end a narrow faith capture thee  a hard  rigorous
delusion  for now everything that is narrow and fixed seduceth and
tempteth thee 

thou hast lost thy goal  alas  how wilt thou forego and forget that
loss  thereby  hast thou also lost thy way 

thou poor rover and rambler  thou tired butterfly  wilt thou have a rest
and a home this evening  then go up to my cave 

thither leadeth the way to my cave  and now will i run quickly away from
thee again  already lieth as it were a shadow upon me 

i will run alone  so that it may again become bright around me 
therefore must i still be a long time merrily upon my legs  in the
evening  however  there will be  dancing with me    

thus spake zarathustra 




lxx  noontide 

  and zarathustra ran and ran  but he found no one else  and was alone
and ever found himself again  he enjoyed and quaffed his solitude  and
thought of good things  for hours  about the hour of noontide  however 
when the sun stood exactly over zarathustra s head  he passed an old 
bent and gnarled tree  which was encircled round by the ardent love of
a vine  and hidden from itself  from this there hung yellow grapes in
abundance  confronting the wanderer  then he felt inclined to quench a
little thirst  and to break off for himself a cluster of grapes  when 
however  he had already his arm out stretched for that purpose  he felt
still more inclined for something else  namely  to lie down beside the
tree at the hour of perfect noontide and sleep 

this zarathustra did  and no sooner had he laid himself on the ground in
the stillness and secrecy of the variegated grass  than he had forgotten
his little thirst  and fell asleep  for as the proverb of zarathustra
saith   one thing is more necessary than the other   only that his eyes
remained open   for they never grew weary of viewing and admiring the
tree and the love of the vine  in falling asleep  however  zarathustra
spake thus to his heart 

 hush  hush  hath not the world now become perfect  what hath happened
unto me 

as a delicate wind danceth invisibly upon parqueted seas  light 
feather light  so  danceth sleep upon me 

no eye doth it close to me  it leaveth my soul awake  light is it 
verily  feather light 

it persuadeth me  i know not how  it toucheth me inwardly with a
caressing hand  it constraineth me  yea  it constraineth me  so that my
soul stretcheth itself out   

  how long and weary it becometh  my strange soul  hath a seventh day
evening come to it precisely at noontide  hath it already wandered too
long  blissfully  among good and ripe things 

it stretcheth itself out  long  longer  it lieth still  my strange
soul  too many good things hath it already tasted  this golden sadness
oppresseth it  it distorteth its mouth 

  as a ship that putteth into the calmest cove   it now draweth up to
the land  weary of long voyages and uncertain seas  is not the land more
faithful 

as such a ship huggeth the shore  tuggeth the shore   then it sufficeth
for a spider to spin its thread from the ship to the land  no stronger
ropes are required there 

as such a weary ship in the calmest cove  so do i also now repose  nigh
to the earth  faithful  trusting  waiting  bound to it with the lightest
threads 

o happiness  o happiness  wilt thou perhaps sing  o my soul  thou liest
in the grass  but this is the secret  solemn hour  when no shepherd
playeth his pipe 

take care  hot noontide sleepeth on the fields  do not sing  hush  the
world is perfect 

do not sing  thou prairie bird  my soul  do not even whisper  lo  hush 
the old noontide sleepeth  it moveth its mouth  doth it not just now
drink a drop of happiness  

  an old brown drop of golden happiness  golden wine  something whisketh
over it  its happiness laugheth  thus  laugheth a god  hush   

   for happiness  how little sufficeth for happiness   thus spake i
once and thought myself wise  but it was a blasphemy  that have i now
learned  wise fools speak better 

the least thing precisely  the gentlest thing  the lightest thing  a
lizard s rustling  a breath  a whisk  an eye glance  little maketh up
the best happiness  hush 

  what hath befallen me  hark  hath time flown away  do i not fall  have
i not fallen  hark  into the well of eternity 

  what happeneth to me  hush  it stingeth me  alas  to the heart  to
the heart  oh  break up  break up  my heart  after such happiness  after
such a sting 

  what  hath not the world just now become perfect  round and ripe  oh 
for the golden round ring  whither doth it fly  let me run after it 
quick 

hush     and here zarathustra stretched himself  and felt that he was
asleep  

 up   said he to himself   thou sleeper  thou noontide sleeper  well
then  up  ye old legs  it is time and more than time  many a good
stretch of road is still awaiting you  

now have ye slept your fill  for how long a time  a half eternity  well
then  up now  mine old heart  for how long after such a sleep mayest
thou  remain awake  

 but then did he fall asleep anew  and his soul spake against him and
defended itself  and lay down again    leave me alone  hush  hath not
the world just now become perfect  oh  for the golden round ball   

 get up   said zarathustra   thou little thief  thou sluggard  what 
still stretching thyself  yawning  sighing  falling into deep wells 

who art thou then  o my soul    and here he became frightened  for a
sunbeam shot down from heaven upon his face  

 o heaven above me   said he sighing  and sat upright   thou gazest at
me  thou hearkenest unto my strange soul 

when wilt thou drink this drop of dew that fell down upon all earthly
things   when wilt thou drink this strange soul  

  when  thou well of eternity  thou joyous  awful  noontide abyss  when
wilt thou drink my soul back into thee  

thus spake zarathustra  and rose from his couch beside the tree  as if
awakening from a strange drunkenness  and behold  there stood the
sun still exactly above his head  one might  however  rightly infer
therefrom that zarathustra had not then slept long 




lxxi  the greeting 

it was late in the afternoon only when zarathustra  after long useless
searching and strolling about  again came home to his cave  when 
however  he stood over against it  not more than twenty paces therefrom 
the thing happened which he now least of all expected  he heard anew the
great cry of distress  and extraordinary  this time the cry came out
of his own cave  it was a long  manifold  peculiar cry  and zarathustra
plainly distinguished that it was composed of many voices  although
heard at a distance it might sound like the cry out of a single mouth 

thereupon zarathustra rushed forward to his cave  and behold  what a
spectacle awaited him after that concert  for there did they all sit
together whom he had passed during the day  the king on the right and
the king on the left  the old magician  the pope  the voluntary
beggar  the shadow  the intellectually conscientious one  the sorrowful
soothsayer  and the ass  the ugliest man  however  had set a crown on
his head  and had put round him two purple girdles   for he liked  like
all ugly ones  to disguise himself and play the handsome person  in the
midst  however  of that sorrowful company stood zarathustra s eagle 
ruffled and disquieted  for it had been called upon to answer too much
for which its pride had not any answer  the wise serpent however hung
round its neck 

all this did zarathustra behold with great astonishment  then however he
scrutinised each individual guest with courteous curiosity  read their
souls and wondered anew  in the meantime the assembled ones had risen
from their seats  and waited with reverence for zarathustra to speak 
zarathustra however spake thus 

 ye despairing ones  ye strange ones  so it was your cry of distress
that i heard  and now do i know also where he is to be sought  whom i
have sought for in vain to day  the higher man   

  in mine own cave sitteth he  the higher man  but why do i wonder  have
not i myself allured him to me by honey offerings and artful lure calls
of my happiness 

but it seemeth to me that ye are badly adapted for company  ye make
one another s hearts fretful  ye that cry for help  when ye sit here
together  there is one that must first come 

  one who will make you laugh once more  a good jovial buffoon  a
dancer  a wind  a wild romp  some old fool   what think ye 

forgive me  however  ye despairing ones  for speaking such trivial words
before you  unworthy  verily  of such guests  but ye do not divine what
maketh my heart wanton   

  ye yourselves do it  and your aspect  forgive it me  for every one
becometh courageous who beholdeth a despairing one  to encourage a
despairing one  every one thinketh himself strong enough to do so 

to myself have ye given this power   a good gift  mine honourable
guests  an excellent guest s present  well  do not then upbraid when i
also offer you something of mine 

this is mine empire and my dominion  that which is mine  however  shall
this evening and tonight be yours  mine animals shall serve you  let my
cave be your resting place 

at house and home with me shall no one despair  in my purlieus do i
protect every one from his wild beasts  and that is the first thing
which i offer you  security 

the second thing  however  is my little finger  and when ye have that 
then take the whole hand also  yea  and the heart with it  welcome here 
welcome to you  my guests  

thus spake zarathustra  and laughed with love and mischief  after this
greeting his guests bowed once more and were reverentially silent  the
king on the right  however  answered him in their name 

 o zarathustra  by the way in which thou hast given us thy hand and thy
greeting  we recognise thee as zarathustra  thou hast humbled thyself
before us  almost hast thou hurt our reverence   

  who however could have humbled himself as thou hast done  with such
pride  that uplifteth us ourselves  a refreshment is it  to our eyes and
hearts 

to behold this  merely  gladly would we ascend higher mountains than
this  for as eager beholders have we come  we wanted to see what
brighteneth dim eyes 

and lo  now is it all over with our cries of distress  now are our minds
and hearts open and enraptured  little is lacking for our spirits to
become wanton 

there is nothing  o zarathustra  that groweth more pleasingly on earth
than a lofty  strong will  it is the finest growth  an entire landscape
refresheth itself at one such tree 

to the pine do i compare him  o zarathustra  which groweth up like
thee  tall  silent  hardy  solitary  of the best  supplest wood 
stately   

  in the end  however  grasping out for its dominion with strong  green
branches  asking weighty questions of the wind  the storm  and whatever
is at home on high places 

  answering more weightily  a commander  a victor  oh  who should not
ascend high mountains to behold such growths 

at thy tree  o zarathustra  the gloomy and ill constituted also refresh
themselves  at thy look even the wavering become steady and heal their
hearts 

and verily  towards thy mountain and thy tree do many eyes turn to day 
a great longing hath arisen  and many have learned to ask   who is
zarathustra  

and those into whose ears thou hast at any time dripped thy song and thy
honey  all the hidden ones  the lone dwellers and the twain dwellers 
have simultaneously said to their hearts 

 doth zarathustra still live  it is no longer worth while to live 
everything is indifferent  everything is useless  or else  we must live
with zarathustra  

 why doth he not come who hath so long announced himself   thus do many
people ask   hath solitude swallowed him up  or should we perhaps go to
him  

now doth it come to pass that solitude itself becometh fragile and
breaketh open  like a grave that breaketh open and can no longer hold
its dead  everywhere one seeth resurrected ones 

now do the waves rise and rise around thy mountain  o zarathustra  and
however high be thy height  many of them must rise up to thee  thy boat
shall not rest much longer on dry ground 

and that we despairing ones have now come into thy cave  and already no
longer despair   it is but a prognostic and a presage that better ones
are on the way to thee   

  for they themselves are on the way to thee  the last remnant of
god among men  that is to say  all the men of great longing  of great
loathing  of great satiety 

  all who do not want to live unless they learn again to hope  unless
they learn from thee  o zarathustra  the great hope  

thus spake the king on the right  and seized the hand of zarathustra in
order to kiss it  but zarathustra checked his veneration  and stepped
back frightened  fleeing as it were  silently and suddenly into the far
distance  after a little while  however  he was again at home with his
guests  looked at them with clear scrutinising eyes  and said 

 my guests  ye higher men  i will speak plain language and plainly with
you  it is not for you that i have waited here in these mountains  

   plain language and plainly   good god   said here the king on the
left to himself   one seeth he doth not know the good occidentals  this
sage out of the orient 

but he meaneth  blunt language and bluntly   well  that is not the worst
taste in these days   

 ye may  verily  all of you be higher men   continued zarathustra   but
for me  ye are neither high enough  nor strong enough 

for me  that is to say  for the inexorable which is now silent in me 
but will not always be silent  and if ye appertain to me  still it is
not as my right arm 

for he who himself standeth  like you  on sickly and tender legs 
wisheth above all to be treated indulgently  whether he be conscious of
it or hide it from himself 

my arms and my legs  however  i do not treat indulgently  i do not treat
my warriors indulgently  how then could ye be fit for my warfare 

with you i should spoil all my victories  and many of you would tumble
over if ye but heard the loud beating of my drums 

moreover  ye are not sufficiently beautiful and well born for me  i
require pure  smooth mirrors for my doctrines  on your surface even mine
own likeness is distorted 

on your shoulders presseth many a burden  many a recollection  many a
mischievous dwarf squatteth in your corners  there is concealed populace
also in you 

and though ye be high and of a higher type  much in you is crooked and
misshapen  there is no smith in the world that could hammer you right
and straight for me 

ye are only bridges  may higher ones pass over upon you  ye signify
steps  so do not upbraid him who ascendeth beyond you into his height 

out of your seed there may one day arise for me a genuine son and
perfect heir  but that time is distant  ye yourselves are not those unto
whom my heritage and name belong 

not for you do i wait here in these mountains  not with you may i
descend for the last time  ye have come unto me only as a presage that
higher ones are on the way to me   

  not the men of great longing  of great loathing  of great satiety  and
that which ye call the remnant of god 

  nay  nay  three times nay  for others do i wait here in these
mountains  and will not lift my foot from thence without them 

  for higher ones  stronger ones  triumphanter ones  merrier ones  for
such as are built squarely in body and soul  laughing lions must come 

o my guests  ye strange ones  have ye yet heard nothing of my children 
and that they are on the way to me 

do speak unto me of my gardens  of my happy isles  of my new beautiful
race  why do ye not speak unto me thereof 

this guests  present do i solicit of your love  that ye speak unto me of
my children  for them am i rich  for them i became poor  what have i not
surrendered 

  what would i not surrender that i might have one thing  these
children  this living plantation  these life trees of my will and of my
highest hope  

thus spake zarathustra  and stopped suddenly in his discourse  for his
longing came over him  and he closed his eyes and his mouth  because
of the agitation of his heart  and all his guests also were silent  and
stood still and confounded  except only that the old soothsayer made
signs with his hands and his gestures 




lxxii  the supper 

for at this point the soothsayer interrupted the greeting of zarathustra
and his guests  he pressed forward as one who had no time to lose 
seized zarathustra s hand and exclaimed   but zarathustra 

one thing is more necessary than the other  so sayest thou thyself 
well  one thing is now more necessary unto me than all others 

a word at the right time  didst thou not invite me to table  and here
are many who have made long journeys  thou dost not mean to feed us
merely with discourses 

besides  all of you have thought too much about freezing  drowning 
suffocating  and other bodily dangers  none of you  however  have
thought of my danger  namely  perishing of hunger  

 thus spake the soothsayer  when zarathustra s animals  however  heard
these words  they ran away in terror  for they saw that all they
had brought home during the day would not be enough to fill the one
soothsayer  

 likewise perishing of thirst   continued the soothsayer   and although
i hear water splashing here like words of wisdom  that is to say 
plenteously and unweariedly  i  want wine 

not every one is a born water drinker like zarathustra  neither doth
water suit weary and withered ones  we deserve wine  it alone giveth
immediate vigour and improvised health  

on this occasion  when the soothsayer was longing for wine  it happened
that the king on the left  the silent one  also found expression for
once   we took care   said he   about wine  i  along with my brother the
king on the right  we have enough of wine   a whole ass load of it  so
there is nothing lacking but bread  

 bread   replied zarathustra  laughing when he spake   it is precisely
bread that anchorites have not  but man doth not live by bread alone 
but also by the flesh of good lambs  of which i have two 

  these shall we slaughter quickly  and cook spicily with sage  it is
so that i like them  and there is also no lack of roots and fruits 
good enough even for the fastidious and dainty   nor of nuts and other
riddles for cracking 

thus will we have a good repast in a little while  but whoever wish to
eat with us must also give a hand to the work  even the kings  for with
zarathustra even a king may be a cook  

this proposal appealed to the hearts of all of them  save that the
voluntary beggar objected to the flesh and wine and spices 

 just hear this glutton zarathustra   said he jokingly   doth one go
into caves and high mountains to make such repasts 

now indeed do i understand what he once taught us  blessed be moderate
poverty   and why he wisheth to do away with beggars  

 be of good cheer   replied zarathustra   as i am  abide by thy
customs  thou excellent one  grind thy corn  drink thy water  praise thy
cooking   if only it make thee glad 

i am a law only for mine own  i am not a law for all  he  however  who
belongeth unto me must be strong of bone and light of foot   

  joyous in fight and feast  no sulker  no john o  dreams  ready for the
hardest task as for the feast  healthy and hale 

the best belongeth unto mine and me  and if it be not given us  then do
we take it   the best food  the purest sky  the strongest thoughts  the
fairest women    

thus spake zarathustra  the king on the right however answered and said 
 strange  did one ever hear such sensible things out of the mouth of a
wise man 

and verily  it is the strangest thing in a wise man  if over and above 
he be still sensible  and not an ass  

thus spake the king on the right and wondered  the ass however  with
ill will  said ye a to his remark  this however was the beginning of
that long repast which is called  the supper  in the history books  at
this there was nothing else spoken of but the higher man 




lxxiii  the higher man 

1 

when i came unto men for the first time  then did i commit the anchorite
folly  the great folly  i appeared on the market place 

and when i spake unto all  i spake unto none  in the evening  however 
rope dancers were my companions  and corpses  and i myself almost a
corpse 

with the new morning  however  there came unto me a new truth  then did
i learn to say   of what account to me are market place and populace and
populace noise and long populace ears  

ye higher men  learn this from me  on the market place no one believeth
in higher men  but if ye will speak there  very well  the populace 
however  blinketh   we are all equal  

 ye higher men    so blinketh the populace   there are no higher men  we
are all equal  man is man  before god  we are all equal  

before god   now  however  this god hath died  before the populace 
however  we will not be equal  ye higher men  away from the
market place 

2 

before god   now however this god hath died  ye higher men  this god was
your greatest danger 

only since he lay in the grave have ye again arisen  now only cometh the
great noontide  now only doth the higher man become  master 

have ye understood this word  o my brethren  ye are frightened  do your
hearts turn giddy  doth the abyss here yawn for you  doth the hell hound
here yelp at you 

well  take heart  ye higher men  now only travaileth the mountain of the
human future  god hath died  now do we desire  the superman to live 

3 

the most careful ask to day   how is man to be maintained   zarathustra
however asketh  as the first and only one   how is man to be surpassed  

the superman  i have at heart  that is the first and only thing to
me  and not man  not the neighbour  not the poorest  not the sorriest 
not the best   

o my brethren  what i can love in man is that he is an over going and a
down going  and also in you there is much that maketh me love and hope 

in that ye have despised  ye higher men  that maketh me hope  for the
great despisers are the great reverers 

in that ye have despaired  there is much to honour  for ye have not
learned to submit yourselves  ye have not learned petty policy 

for to day have the petty people become master  they all preach
submission and humility and policy and diligence and consideration and
the long et cetera of petty virtues 

whatever is of the effeminate type  whatever originateth from the
servile type  and especially the populace mishmash   that wisheth now to
be master of all human destiny  o disgust  disgust  disgust 

that asketh and asketh and never tireth   how is man to maintain himself
best  longest  most pleasantly   thereby  are they the masters of
to day 

these masters of to day  surpass them  o my brethren  these petty
people  they are the superman s greatest danger 

surpass  ye higher men  the petty virtues  the petty policy  the
sand grain considerateness  the ant hill trumpery  the pitiable
comfortableness  the  happiness of the greatest number    

and rather despair than submit yourselves  and verily  i love you 
because ye know not to day how to live  ye higher men  for thus do ye
live  best 

4 

have ye courage  o my brethren  are ye stout hearted  not the courage
before witnesses  but anchorite and eagle courage  which not even a god
any longer beholdeth 

cold souls  mules  the blind and the drunken  i do not call
stout hearted  he hath heart who knoweth fear  but vanquisheth it  who
seeth the abyss  but with pride 

he who seeth the abyss  but with eagle s eyes   he who with eagle s
talons graspeth the abyss  he hath courage   

5 

 man is evil   so said to me for consolation  all the wisest ones  ah 
if only it be still true to day  for the evil is man s best force 

 man must become better and eviler   so do  i  teach  the evilest is
necessary for the superman s best 

it may have been well for the preacher of the petty people to suffer and
be burdened by men s sin  i  however  rejoice in great sin as my great
consolation   

such things  however  are not said for long ears  every word  also 
is not suited for every mouth  these are fine far away things  at them
sheep s claws shall not grasp 

6 

ye higher men  think ye that i am here to put right what ye have put
wrong 

or that i wished henceforth to make snugger couches for you sufferers 
or show you restless  miswandering  misclimbing ones  new and easier
footpaths 

nay  nay  three times nay  always more  always better ones of your
type shall succumb   for ye shall always have it worse and harder  thus
only  

  thus only groweth man aloft to the height where the lightning striketh
and shattereth him  high enough for the lightning 

towards the few  the long  the remote go forth my soul and my seeking 
of what account to me are your many little  short miseries 

ye do not yet suffer enough for me  for ye suffer from yourselves  ye
have not yet suffered from man  ye would lie if ye spake otherwise  none
of you suffereth from what  i  have suffered   

7 

it is not enough for me that the lightning no longer doeth harm  i do
not wish to conduct it away  it shall learn  to work for me   

my wisdom hath accumulated long like a cloud  it becometh stiller and
darker  so doeth all wisdom which shall one day bear lightnings   

unto these men of to day will i not be light  nor be called light 
them  will i blind  lightning of my wisdom  put out their eyes 

8 

do not will anything beyond your power  there is a bad falseness in
those who will beyond their power 

especially when they will great things  for they awaken distrust in
great things  these subtle false coiners and stage players   

  until at last they are false towards themselves  squint eyed  whited
cankers  glossed over with strong words  parade virtues and brilliant
false deeds 

take good care there  ye higher men  for nothing is more precious to me 
and rarer  than honesty 

is this to day not that of the populace  the populace however knoweth
not what is great and what is small  what is straight and what is
honest  it is innocently crooked  it ever lieth 

9 

have a good distrust to day ye  higher men  ye enheartened ones  ye
open hearted ones  and keep your reasons secret  for this to day is that
of the populace 

what the populace once learned to believe without reasons  who could  
refute it to them by means of reasons 

and on the market place one convinceth with gestures  but reasons make
the populace distrustful 

and when truth hath once triumphed there  then ask yourselves with good
distrust   what strong error hath fought for it  

be on your guard also against the learned  they hate you  because they
are unproductive  they have cold  withered eyes before which every bird
is unplumed 

such persons vaunt about not lying  but inability to lie is still far
from being love to truth  be on your guard 

freedom from fever is still far from being knowledge  refrigerated
spirits i do not believe in  he who cannot lie  doth not know what truth
is 

10 

if ye would go up high  then use your own legs  do not get yourselves
carried aloft  do not seat yourselves on other people s backs and heads 

thou hast mounted  however  on horseback  thou now ridest briskly up
to thy goal  well  my friend  but thy lame foot is also with thee on
horseback 

when thou reachest thy goal  when thou alightest from thy horse 
precisely on thy height  thou higher man   then wilt thou stumble 

11 

ye creating ones  ye higher men  one is only pregnant with one s own
child 

do not let yourselves be imposed upon or put upon  who then is your
neighbour  even if ye act  for your neighbour   ye still do not create
for him 

unlearn  i pray you  this  for   ye creating ones  your very virtue
wisheth you to have naught to do with  for  and  on account of  and
 because   against these false little words shall ye stop your ears 

 for one s neighbour   is the virtue only of the petty people  there it
is said  like and like   and  hand washeth hand    they have neither the
right nor the power for your self seeking 

in your self seeking  ye creating ones  there is the foresight and
foreseeing of the pregnant  what no one s eye hath yet seen  namely  the
fruit  this  sheltereth and saveth and nourisheth your entire love 

where your entire love is  namely  with your child  there is also your
entire virtue  your work  your will is your  neighbour   let no false
values impose upon you 

12 

ye creating ones  ye higher men  whoever hath to give birth is sick 
whoever hath given birth  however  is unclean 

ask women  one giveth birth  not because it giveth pleasure  the pain
maketh hens and poets cackle 

ye creating ones  in you there is much uncleanliness  that is because ye
have had to be mothers 

a new child  oh  how much new filth hath also come into the world  go
apart  he who hath given birth shall wash his soul 

13 

be not virtuous beyond your powers  and seek nothing from yourselves
opposed to probability 

walk in the footsteps in which your fathers  virtue hath already walked 
how would ye rise high  if your fathers  will should not rise with you 

he  however  who would be a firstling  let him take care lest he also
become a lastling  and where the vices of your fathers are  there should
ye not set up as saints 

he whose fathers were inclined for women  and for strong wine and flesh
of wildboar swine  what would it be if he demanded chastity of himself 

a folly would it be  much  verily  doth it seem to me for such a one  if
he should be the husband of one or of two or of three women 

and if he founded monasteries  and inscribed over their portals   the
way to holiness    i should still say  what good is it  it is a new
folly 

he hath founded for himself a penance house and refuge house  much good
may it do  but i do not believe in it 

in solitude there groweth what any one bringeth into it  also the brute
in one s nature  thus is solitude inadvisable unto many 

hath there ever been anything filthier on earth than the saints of
the wilderness  around them was not only the devil loose  but also the
swine 

14 

shy  ashamed  awkward  like the tiger whose spring hath failed  thus  ye
higher men  have i often seen you slink aside  a cast which ye made had
failed 

but what doth it matter  ye dice players  ye had not learned to play and
mock  as one must play and mock  do we not ever sit at a great table of
mocking and playing 

and if great things have been a failure with you  have ye yourselves
therefore  been a failure  and if ye yourselves have been a failure 
hath man therefore  been a failure  if man  however  hath been a
failure  well then  never mind 

15 

the higher its type  always the seldomer doth a thing succeed  ye higher
men here  have ye not all  been failures 

be of good cheer  what doth it matter  how much is still possible  learn
to laugh at yourselves  as ye ought to laugh 

what wonder even that ye have failed and only half succeeded  ye
half shattered ones  doth not  man s future strive and struggle in you 

man s furthest  profoundest  star highest issues  his prodigious
powers  do not all these foam through one another in your vessel 

what wonder that many a vessel shattereth  learn to laugh at yourselves 
as ye ought to laugh  ye higher men  o  how much is still possible 

and verily  how much hath already succeeded  how rich is this earth in
small  good  perfect things  in well constituted things 

set around you small  good  perfect things  ye higher men  their golden
maturity healeth the heart  the perfect teacheth one to hope 

16 

what hath hitherto been the greatest sin here on earth  was it not the
word of him who said   woe unto them that laugh now  

did he himself find no cause for laughter on the earth  then he sought
badly  a child even findeth cause for it 

he  did not love sufficiently  otherwise would he also have loved
us  the laughing ones  but he hated and hooted us  wailing and
teeth gnashing did he promise us 

must one then curse immediately  when one doth not love  that  seemeth
to me bad taste  thus did he  however  this absolute one  he sprang from
the populace 

and he himself just did not love sufficiently  otherwise would he have
raged less because people did not love him  all great love doth not seek
love   it seeketh more 

go out of the way of all such absolute ones  they are a poor sickly
type  a populace type  they look at this life with ill will  they have
an evil eye for this earth 

go out of the way of all such absolute ones  they have heavy feet and
sultry hearts   they do not know how to dance  how could the earth be
light to such ones 

17 

tortuously do all good things come nigh to their goal  like cats
they curve their backs  they purr inwardly with their approaching
happiness   all good things laugh 

his step betrayeth whether a person already walketh on his own path 
just see me walk  he  however  who cometh nigh to his goal  danceth 

and verily  a statue have i not become  not yet do i stand there stiff 
stupid and stony  like a pillar  i love fast racing 

and though there be on earth fens and dense afflictions  he who hath
light feet runneth even across the mud  and danceth  as upon well swept
ice 

lift up your hearts  my brethren  high  higher  and do not forget your
legs  lift up also your legs  ye good dancers  and better still  if ye
stand upon your heads 

18 

this crown of the laughter  this rose garland crown  i myself have put
on this crown  i myself have consecrated my laughter  no one else have i
found to day potent enough for this 

zarathustra the dancer  zarathustra the light one  who beckoneth with
his pinions  one ready for flight  beckoning unto all birds  ready and
prepared  a blissfully light spirited one   

zarathustra the soothsayer  zarathustra the sooth laugher  no impatient
one  no absolute one  one who loveth leaps and side leaps  i myself have
put on this crown 

19 

lift up your hearts  my brethren  high  higher  and do not forget your
legs  lift up also your legs  ye good dancers  and better still if ye
stand upon your heads 

there are also heavy animals in a state of happiness  there are
club footed ones from the beginning  curiously do they exert themselves 
like an elephant which endeavoureth to stand upon its head 

better  however  to be foolish with happiness than foolish with
misfortune  better to dance awkwardly than walk lamely  so learn  i
pray you  my wisdom  ye higher men  even the worst thing hath two good
reverse sides   

  even the worst thing hath good dancing legs  so learn  i pray you  ye
higher men  to put yourselves on your proper legs 

so unlearn  i pray you  the sorrow sighing  and all the
populace sadness  oh  how sad the buffoons of the populace seem to me
to day  this to day  however  is that of the populace 

20 

do like unto the wind when it rusheth forth from its mountain caves 
unto its own piping will it dance  the seas tremble and leap under its
footsteps 

that which giveth wings to asses  that which milketh the lionesses   
praised be that good  unruly spirit  which cometh like a hurricane unto
all the present and unto all the populace   

  which is hostile to thistle heads and puzzle heads  and to all
withered leaves and weeds   praised be this wild  good  free spirit of
the storm  which danceth upon fens and afflictions  as upon meadows 

which hateth the consumptive populace dogs  and all the ill constituted 
sullen brood   praised be this spirit of all free spirits  the laughing
storm  which bloweth dust into the eyes of all the melanopic and
melancholic 

ye higher men  the worst thing in you is that ye have none of you
learned to dance as ye ought to dance  to dance beyond yourselves  what
doth it matter that ye have failed 

how many things are still possible  so learn to laugh beyond yourselves 
lift up your hearts  ye good dancers  high  higher  and do not forget
the good laughter 

this crown of the laughter  this rose garland crown  to you my brethren
do i cast this crown  laughing have i consecrated  ye higher men  learn 
i pray you  to laugh 




lxxiv  the song of melancholy 

1 

when zarathustra spake these sayings  he stood nigh to the entrance of
his cave  with the last words  however  he slipped away from his guests 
and fled for a little while into the open air 

 o pure odours around me   cried he   o blessed stillness around me  but
where are mine animals  hither  hither  mine eagle and my serpent 

tell me  mine animals  these higher men  all of them  do they perhaps
not smell well  o pure odours around me  now only do i know and feel how
i love you  mine animals  

  and zarathustra said once more   i love you  mine animals   the eagle 
however  and the serpent pressed close to him when he spake these
words  and looked up to him  in this attitude were they all three silent
together  and sniffed and sipped the good air with one another  for the
air here outside was better than with the higher men 

2 

hardly  however  had zarathustra left the cave when the old magician got
up  looked cunningly about him  and said   he is gone 

and already  ye higher men  let me tickle you with this complimentary
and flattering name  as he himself doeth  already doth mine evil spirit
of deceit and magic attack me  my melancholy devil 

  which is an adversary to this zarathustra from the very heart  forgive
it for this  now doth it wish to conjure before you  it hath just its
hour  in vain do i struggle with this evil spirit 

unto all of you  whatever honours ye like to assume in your names 
whether ye call yourselves  the free spirits  or  the conscientious  
or  the penitents of the spirit   or  the unfettered   or  the great
longers    

  unto all of you  who like me suffer from the great loathing  to
whom the old god hath died  and as yet no new god lieth in cradles and
swaddling clothes  unto all of you is mine evil spirit and magic devil
favourable 

i know you  ye higher men  i know him   i know also this fiend whom i
love in spite of me  this zarathustra  he himself often seemeth to me
like the beautiful mask of a saint 

  like a new strange mummery in which mine evil spirit  the melancholy
devil  delighteth   i love zarathustra  so doth it often seem to me  for
the sake of mine evil spirit   

but already doth it attack me and constrain me  this spirit of
melancholy  this evening twilight devil  and verily  ye higher men  it
hath a longing  

  open your eyes   it hath a longing to come naked  whether male or
female  i do not yet know  but it cometh  it constraineth me  alas  open
your wits 

the day dieth out  unto all things cometh now the evening  also unto
the best things  hear now  and see  ye higher men  what devil  man or
woman  this spirit of evening melancholy is  

thus spake the old magician  looked cunningly about him  and then seized
his harp 

3 

     in evening s limpid air 
     what time the dew s soothings
     unto the earth downpour 
     invisibly and unheard  
     for tender shoe gear wear
     the soothing dews  like all that s kind gentle   
     bethinkst thou then  bethinkst thou  burning heart 
     how once thou thirstedest
     for heaven s kindly teardrops and dew s down droppings 
     all singed and weary thirstedest 
     what time on yellow grass pathways
     wicked  occidental sunny glances
     through sombre trees about thee sported 
     blindingly sunny glow glances  gladly hurting 

      of truth the wooer   thou    so taunted they  
      nay   merely poet 
     a brute insidious  plundering  grovelling 
     that aye must lie 
     that wittingly  wilfully  aye must lie 
     for booty lusting 
     motley masked 
     self hidden  shrouded 
     himself his booty  
     he  of truth the wooer 
     nay   mere fool   mere poet 
     just motley speaking 
     from mask of fool confusedly shouting 
     circumambling on fabricated word bridges 
     on motley rainbow arches 
      twixt the spurious heavenly 
     and spurious earthly 
     round us roving  round us soaring   
     mere fool   mere poet 

     he  of truth the wooer 
     not still  stiff  smooth and cold 
     become an image 
     a godlike statue 
     set up in front of temples 
     as a god s own door guard 
     nay  hostile to all such truthfulness statues 
     in every desert homelier than at temples 
     with cattish wantonness 
     through every window leaping
     quickly into chances 
     every wild forest a sniffing 
     greedily longingly  sniffing 
     that thou  in wild forests 
      mong the motley speckled fierce creatures 
     shouldest rove  sinful sound and fine coloured 
     with longing lips smacking 
     blessedly mocking  blessedly hellish  blessedly bloodthirsty 
     robbing  skulking  lying  roving   

     or unto eagles like which fixedly 
     long adown the precipice look 
     adown their precipice   
     oh  how they whirl down now 
     thereunder  therein 
     to ever deeper profoundness whirling   
     then 
     sudden 
     with aim aright 
     with quivering flight 
     on lambkins pouncing 
     headlong down  sore hungry 
     for lambkins longing 
     fierce  gainst all lamb spirits 
     furious fierce all that look
     sheeplike  or lambeyed  or crisp woolly 
       grey  with lambsheep kindliness 

     even thus 
     eaglelike  pantherlike 
     are the poet s desires 
     are thine own desires  neath a thousand guises 
     thou fool   thou poet 
     thou who all mankind viewedst  
     so god  as sheep   
     the god to rend within mankind 
     as the sheep in mankind 
     and in rending laughing  

     that  that is thine own blessedness 
     of a panther and eagle  blessedness 
     of a poet and fool  the blessedness   

     in evening s limpid air 
     what time the moon s sickle 
     green   twixt the purple glowings 
     and jealous  steal th forth 
       of day the foe 
     with every step in secret 
     the rosy garland hammocks
     downsickling  till they ve sunken
     down nightwards  faded  downsunken   

     thus had i sunken one day
     from mine own truth insanity 
     from mine own fervid day longings 
     of day aweary  sick of sunshine 
       sunk downwards  evenwards  shadowwards 
     by one sole trueness
     all scorched and thirsty 
       bethinkst thou still  bethinkst thou  burning heart 
     how then thou thirstedest   
     that i should banned be
     from all the trueness 
     mere fool   mere poet 




lxxv  science 

thus sang the magician  and all who were present went like birds
unawares into the net of his artful and melancholy voluptuousness 
only the spiritually conscientious one had not been caught  he at once
snatched the harp from the magician and called out   air  let in good
air  let in zarathustra  thou makest this cave sultry and poisonous 
thou bad old magician 

thou seducest  thou false one  thou subtle one  to unknown desires and
deserts  and alas  that such as thou should talk and make ado about the
truth 

alas  to all free spirits who are not on their guard against such
magicians  it is all over with their freedom  thou teachest and temptest
back into prisons   

  thou old melancholy devil  out of thy lament soundeth a lurement  thou
resemblest those who with their praise of chastity secretly invite to
voluptuousness  

thus spake the conscientious one  the old magician  however  looked
about him  enjoying his triumph  and on that account put up with the
annoyance which the conscientious one caused him   be still   said he
with modest voice   good songs want to re echo well  after good songs
one should be long silent 

thus do all those present  the higher men  thou  however  hast perhaps
understood but little of my song  in thee there is little of the magic
spirit 

 thou praisest me   replied the conscientious one   in that thou
separatest me from thyself  very well  but  ye others  what do i see  ye
still sit there  all of you  with lusting eyes   

ye free spirits  whither hath your freedom gone  ye almost seem to me
to resemble those who have long looked at bad girls dancing naked  your
souls themselves dance 

in you  ye higher men  there must be more of that which the magician
calleth his evil spirit of magic and deceit   we must indeed be
different 

and verily  we spake and thought long enough together ere zarathustra
came home to his cave  for me not to be unaware that we are different 

we seek different things even here aloft  ye and i  for i seek more
security  on that account have i come to zarathustra  for he is still
the most steadfast tower and will  

  to day  when everything tottereth  when all the earth quaketh  ye 
however  when i see what eyes ye make  it almost seemeth to me that ye
seek more insecurity 

  more horror  more danger  more earthquake  ye long  it almost seemeth
so to me  forgive my presumption  ye higher men   

  ye long for the worst and dangerousest life  which frighteneth me
most   for the life of wild beasts  for forests  caves  steep mountains
and labyrinthine gorges 

and it is not those who lead out of danger that please you best  but
those who lead you away from all paths  the misleaders  but if
such longing in you be actual  it seemeth to me nevertheless to be
impossible 

for fear  that is man s original and fundamental feeling  through fear
everything is explained  original sin and original virtue  through fear
there grew also my virtue  that is to say  science 

for fear of wild animals  that hath been longest fostered in
man  inclusive of the animal which he concealeth and feareth in
himself   zarathustra calleth it  the beast inside  

such prolonged ancient fear  at last become subtle  spiritual and
intellectual  at present  me thinketh  it is called science    

thus spake the conscientious one  but zarathustra  who had just come
back into his cave and had heard and divined the last discourse  threw a
handful of roses to the conscientious one  and laughed on account of
his  truths    why   he exclaimed   what did i hear just now  verily  it
seemeth to me  thou art a fool  or else i myself am one  and quietly and
quickly will i put thy  truth  upside down 

for fear  is an exception with us  courage  however  and adventure  and
delight in the uncertain  in the unattempted  courage seemeth to me the
entire primitive history of man 

the wildest and most courageous animals hath he envied and robbed of all
their virtues  thus only did he become  man 

this courage  at last become subtle  spiritual and intellectual  this
human courage  with eagle s pinions and serpent s wisdom  this  it
seemeth to me  is called at present   

 zarathustra   cried all of them there assembled  as if with one voice 
and burst out at the same time into a great laughter  there arose 
however  from them as it were a heavy cloud  even the magician laughed 
and said wisely   well  it is gone  mine evil spirit 

and did i not myself warn you against it when i said that it was a
deceiver  a lying and deceiving spirit 

especially when it showeth itself naked  but what can  i  do with regard
to its tricks  have  i  created it and the world 

well  let us be good again  and of good cheer  and although zarathustra
looketh with evil eye  just see him  he disliketh me   

  ere night cometh will he again learn to love and laud me  he cannot
live long without committing such follies 

he  loveth his enemies  this art knoweth he better than any one i have
seen  but he taketh revenge for it  on his friends  

thus spake the old magician  and the higher men applauded him  so that
zarathustra went round  and mischievously and lovingly shook hands with
his friends   like one who hath to make amends and apologise to every
one for something  when however he had thereby come to the door of his
cave  lo  then had he again a longing for the good air outside  and for
his animals   and wished to steal out 




lxxvi  among daughters of the desert 

1 

 go not away   said then the wanderer who called himself zarathustra s
shadow   abide with us  otherwise the old gloomy affliction might again
fall upon us 

now hath that old magician given us of his worst for our good  and
lo  the good  pious pope there hath tears in his eyes  and hath quite
embarked again upon the sea of melancholy 

those kings may well put on a good air before us still  for that have
they learned best of us all at present  had they however no one to see
them  i wager that with them also the bad game would again commence   

  the bad game of drifting clouds  of damp melancholy  of curtained
heavens  of stolen suns  of howling autumn winds 

  the bad game of our howling and crying for help  abide with us  o
zarathustra  here there is much concealed misery that wisheth to speak 
much evening  much cloud  much damp air 

thou hast nourished us with strong food for men  and powerful proverbs 
do not let the weakly  womanly spirits attack us anew at dessert 

thou alone makest the air around thee strong and clear  did i ever find
anywhere on earth such good air as with thee in thy cave 

many lands have i seen  my nose hath learned to test and estimate many
kinds of air  but with thee do my nostrils taste their greatest delight 

unless it be   unless it be    do forgive an old recollection  forgive
me an old after dinner song  which i once composed amongst daughters of
the desert   

for with them was there equally good  clear  oriental air  there was i
furthest from cloudy  damp  melancholy old europe 

then did i love such oriental maidens and other blue kingdoms of heaven 
over which hang no clouds and no thoughts 

ye would not believe how charmingly they sat there  when they did
not dance  profound  but without thoughts  like little secrets  like
beribboned riddles  like dessert nuts  

many hued and foreign  forsooth  but without clouds  riddles which
can be guessed  to please such maidens i then composed an after dinner
psalm  

thus spake the wanderer who called himself zarathustra s shadow  and
before any one answered him  he had seized the harp of the old magician 
crossed his legs  and looked calmly and sagely around him   with his
nostrils  however  he inhaled the air slowly and questioningly  like one
who in new countries tasteth new foreign air  afterward he began to sing
with a kind of roaring

the deserts grow  woe him who doth them hide 

       ha 
     solemnly 
     in effect solemnly 
     a worthy beginning 
     afric manner  solemnly 
     of a lion worthy 
     or perhaps of a virtuous howl monkey  
       but it s naught to you 
     ye friendly damsels dearly loved 
     at whose own feet to me 
     the first occasion 
     to a european under palm trees 
     a seat is now granted   selah 

     wonderful  truly 
     here do i sit now 
     the desert nigh  and yet i am
     so far still from the desert 
     even in naught yet deserted 
     that is  i m swallowed down
     by this the smallest oasis   
       it opened up just yawning 
     its loveliest mouth agape 
     most sweet odoured of all mouthlets 
     then fell i right in 
     right down  right through  in  mong you

     if it had e er
     a such loveliest oasis belly

     that doubt th more eagerly than doth any
     elderly married woman

     amen 

     here do i sit now 
     in this the smallest oasis 
     like a date indeed 
     brown  quite sweet  gold suppurating 
     for rounded mouth of maiden longing 
     but yet still more for youthful  maidlike 
     ice cold and snow white and incisory

     paradisal air  truly 
     bright and buoyant air  golden mottled 
     as goodly air as ever
     from lunar orb downfell  
     be it by hazard 
     or supervened it by arrogancy 
     as the ancient poets relate it 
     but doubter  i m now calling it
     in question   with this do i come indeed
     out of europe 
     that doubt th more eagerly than doth any
     elderly married woman 
     may the lord improve it 
     amen 

     this the finest air drinking 
     with nostrils out swelled like goblets 
     lacking future  lacking remembrances
     thus do i sit here  ye
     friendly damsels dearly loved 
     and look at the palm tree there 
     how it  to a dance girl  like 
     doth bow and bend and on its haunches bob 
       one doth it too  when one view th it long   
     to a dance girl like  who as it seem th to me 
     too long  and dangerously persistent 
     always  always  just on single leg hath stood 
       then forgot she thereby  as it seem th to me 
     the other leg 
     for vainly i  at least 
     did search for the amissing
     fellow jewel
       namely  the other leg  
     in the sanctified precincts 
     nigh her very dearest  very tenderest 
     flapping and fluttering and flickering skirting 
     yea  if ye should  ye beauteous friendly ones 
     quite take my word 
     she hath  alas  lost it 
     hu   hu   hu   hu   hu 
     it is away 
     for ever away 
     the other leg 
     oh  pity for that loveliest other leg 
     where may it now tarry  all forsaken weeping 
     the lonesomest leg 
     in fear perhaps before a
     furious  yellow  blond and curled
     leonine monster   or perhaps even
     gnawed away  nibbled badly

lxxvii  the awakening 

1 

after the song of the wanderer and shadow  the cave became all at once
full of noise and laughter  and since the assembled guests all spake
simultaneously  and even the ass  encouraged thereby  no longer
remained silent  a little aversion and scorn for his visitors came over
zarathustra  although he rejoiced at their gladness  for it seemed to
him a sign of convalescence  so he slipped out into the open air and
spake to his animals 

 whither hath their distress now gone   said he  and already did he
himself feel relieved of his petty disgust   with me  it seemeth that
they have unlearned their cries of distress 

  though  alas  not yet their crying   and zarathustra stopped his
ears  for just then did the ye a of the ass mix strangely with the noisy
jubilation of those higher men 

 they are merry   he began again   and who knoweth  perhaps at their
host s expense  and if they have learned of me to laugh  still it is not
my laughter they have learned 

but what matter about that  they are old people  they recover in their
own way  they laugh in their own way  mine ears have already endured
worse and have not become peevish 

this day is a victory  he already yieldeth  he fleeth  the spirit of
gravity  mine old arch enemy  how well this day is about to end  which
began so badly and gloomily 

and it is about to end  already cometh the evening  over the sea
rideth it hither  the good rider  how it bobbeth  the blessed one  the
home returning one  in its purple saddles 

the sky gazeth brightly thereon  the world lieth deep  oh  all ye
strange ones who have come to me  it is already worth while to have
lived with me  

thus spake zarathustra  and again came the cries and laughter of the
higher men out of the cave  then began he anew 

 they bite at it  my bait taketh  there departeth also from them their
enemy  the spirit of gravity  now do they learn to laugh at themselves 
do i hear rightly 

my virile food taketh effect  my strong and savoury sayings  and verily 
i did not nourish them with flatulent vegetables  but with warrior food 
with conqueror food  new desires did i awaken 

new hopes are in their arms and legs  their hearts expand  they find new
words  soon will their spirits breathe wantonness 

such food may sure enough not be proper for children  nor even for
longing girls old and young  one persuadeth their bowels otherwise  i am
not their physician and teacher 

the disgust departeth from these higher men  well  that is my victory 
in my domain they become assured  all stupid shame fleeth away  they
empty themselves 

they empty their hearts  good times return unto them  they keep holiday
and ruminate   they become thankful 

that do i take as the best sign  they become thankful  not long will it
be ere they devise festivals  and put up memorials to their old joys 

they are convalescents   thus spake zarathustra joyfully to his heart
and gazed outward  his animals  however  pressed up to him  and honoured
his happiness and his silence 

2 

all on a sudden however  zarathustra s ear was frightened  for the cave
which had hitherto been full of noise and laughter  became all at once
still as death   his nose  however  smelt a sweet scented vapour and
incense odour  as if from burning pine cones 

 what happeneth  what are they about   he asked himself  and stole up
to the entrance  that he might be able unobserved to see his guests 
but wonder upon wonder  what was he then obliged to behold with his own
eyes 

 they have all of them become pious again  they pray  they are
mad    said he  and was astonished beyond measure  and forsooth  all
these higher men  the two kings  the pope out of service  the evil
magician  the voluntary beggar  the wanderer and shadow  the old
soothsayer  the spiritually conscientious one  and the ugliest man  they
all lay on their knees like children and credulous old women  and
worshipped the ass  and just then began the ugliest man to gurgle and
snort  as if something unutterable in him tried to find expression 
when  however  he had actually found words  behold  it was a pious 
strange litany in praise of the adored and censed ass  and the litany
sounded thus 

amen  and glory and honour and wisdom and thanks and praise and strength
be to our god  from everlasting to everlasting 

  the ass  however  here brayed ye a 

he carrieth our burdens  he hath taken upon him the form of a servant 
he is patient of heart and never saith nay  and he who loveth his god
chastiseth him 

  the ass  however  here brayed ye a 

he speaketh not  except that he ever saith yea to the world which
he created  thus doth he extol his world  it is his artfulness that
speaketh not  thus is he rarely found wrong 

  the ass  however  here brayed ye a 

uncomely goeth he through the world  grey is the favourite colour in
which he wrappeth his virtue  hath he spirit  then doth he conceal it 
every one  however  believeth in his long ears 

  the ass  however  here brayed ye a 

what hidden wisdom it is to wear long ears  and only to say yea and
never nay  hath he not created the world in his own image  namely  as
stupid as possible 

  the ass  however  here brayed ye a 

thou goest straight and crooked ways  it concerneth thee little what
seemeth straight or crooked unto us men  beyond good and evil is thy
domain  it is thine innocence not to know what innocence is 

  the ass  however  here brayed ye a 

lo  how thou spurnest none from thee  neither beggars nor kings  thou
sufferest little children to come unto thee  and when the bad boys decoy
thee  then sayest thou simply  ye a 

  the ass  however  here brayed ye a 

thou lovest she asses and fresh figs  thou art no food despiser  a
thistle tickleth thy heart when thou chancest to be hungry  there is the
wisdom of a god therein 

  the ass  however  here brayed ye a 




lxxviii  the ass festival 

1 

at this place in the litany  however  zarathustra could no longer
control himself  he himself cried out ye a  louder even than the ass 
and sprang into the midst of his maddened guests   whatever are you
about  ye grown up children   he exclaimed  pulling up the praying ones
from the ground   alas  if any one else  except zarathustra  had seen
you 

every one would think you the worst blasphemers  or the very foolishest
old women  with your new belief 

and thou thyself  thou old pope  how is it in accordance with thee  to
adore an ass in such a manner as god    

 o zarathustra   answered the pope   forgive me  but in divine matters
i am more enlightened even than thou  and it is right that it should be
so 

better to adore god so  in this form  than in no form at all  think over
this saying  mine exalted friend  thou wilt readily divine that in such
a saying there is wisdom 

he who said  god is a spirit   made the greatest stride and slide
hitherto made on earth towards unbelief  such a dictum is not easily
amended again on earth 

mine old heart leapeth and boundeth because there is still something
to adore on earth  forgive it  o zarathustra  to an old  pious
pontiff heart    

   and thou   said zarathustra to the wanderer and shadow   thou callest
and thinkest thyself a free spirit  and thou here practisest such
idolatry and hierolatry 

worse verily  doest thou here than with thy bad brown girls  thou bad 
new believer  

 it is sad enough   answered the wanderer and shadow   thou art right 
but how can i help it  the old god liveth again  o zarathustra  thou
mayst say what thou wilt 

the ugliest man is to blame for it all  he hath reawakened him  and
if he say that he once killed him  with gods death is always just a
prejudice  

   and thou   said zarathustra   thou bad old magician  what didst thou
do  who ought to believe any longer in thee in this free age  when thou
believest in such divine donkeyism 

it was a stupid thing that thou didst  how couldst thou  a shrewd man 
do such a stupid thing  

 o zarathustra   answered the shrewd magician   thou art right  it was a
stupid thing   it was also repugnant to me  

   and thou even   said zarathustra to the spiritually conscientious
one   consider  and put thy finger to thy nose  doth nothing go against
thy conscience here  is thy spirit not too cleanly for this praying and
the fumes of those devotees  

 there is something therein   said the spiritually conscientious one 
and put his finger to his nose   there is something in this spectacle
which even doeth good to my conscience 

perhaps i dare not believe in god  certain it is however  that god
seemeth to me most worthy of belief in this form 

god is said to be eternal  according to the testimony of the most pious 
he who hath so much time taketh his time  as slow and as stupid as
possible  thereby can such a one nevertheless go very far 

and he who hath too much spirit might well become infatuated with
stupidity and folly  think of thyself  o zarathustra 

thou thyself  verily  even thou couldst well become an ass through
superabundance of wisdom 

doth not the true sage willingly walk on the crookedest paths  the
evidence teacheth it  o zarathustra   thine own evidence  

   and thou thyself  finally   said zarathustra  and turned towards the
ugliest man  who still lay on the ground stretching up his arm to the
ass  for he gave it wine to drink    say  thou nondescript  what hast
thou been about 

thou seemest to me transformed  thine eyes glow  the mantle of the
sublime covereth thine ugliness  what didst thou do 

is it then true what they say  that thou hast again awakened him  and
why  was he not for good reasons killed and made away with 

thou thyself seemest to me awakened  what didst thou do  why didst thou
turn round  why didst thou get converted  speak  thou nondescript  

 o zarathustra   answered the ugliest man   thou art a rogue 

whether he yet liveth  or again liveth  or is thoroughly dead  which of
us both knoweth that best  i ask thee 

one thing however do i know   from thyself did i learn it once  o
zarathustra  he who wanteth to kill most thoroughly  laugheth 

 not by wrath but by laughter doth one kill   thus spakest thou once 
o zarathustra  thou hidden one  thou destroyer without wrath  thou
dangerous saint   thou art a rogue  

2 

then  however  did it come to pass that zarathustra  astonished at such
merely roguish answers  jumped back to the door of his cave  and turning
towards all his guests  cried out with a strong voice 

 o ye wags  all of you  ye buffoons  why do ye dissemble and disguise
yourselves before me 

how the hearts of all of you convulsed with delight and wickedness 
because ye had at last become again like little children  namely 
pious   

  because ye at last did again as children do  namely  prayed  folded
your hands and said  good god  

but now leave  i pray you  this nursery  mine own cave  where to day
all childishness is carried on  cool down  here outside  your hot
child wantonness and heart tumult 

to be sure  except ye become as little children ye shall not enter into
that kingdom of heaven    and zarathustra pointed aloft with his hands  

 but we do not at all want to enter into the kingdom of heaven  we have
become men   so we want the kingdom of earth  

3 

and once more began zarathustra to speak   o my new friends   said he   
 ye strange ones  ye higher men  how well do ye now please me   

  since ye have again become joyful  ye have  verily  all blossomed
forth  it seemeth to me that for such flowers as you  new festivals are
required 

  a little valiant nonsense  some divine service and ass festival  some
old joyful zarathustra fool  some blusterer to blow your souls bright 

forget not this night and this ass festival  ye higher men  that did ye
devise when with me  that do i take as a good omen   such things only
the convalescents devise 

and should ye celebrate it again  this ass festival  do it from love to
yourselves  do it also from love to me  and in remembrance of me  

thus spake zarathustra 




lxxix  the drunken song 

1 

meanwhile one after another had gone out into the open air  and into the
cool  thoughtful night  zarathustra himself  however  led the ugliest
man by the hand  that he might show him his night world  and the great
round moon  and the silvery water falls near his cave  there they at
last stood still beside one another  all of them old people  but with
comforted  brave hearts  and astonished in themselves that it was so
well with them on earth  the mystery of the night  however  came nigher
and nigher to their hearts  and anew zarathustra thought to himself 
 oh  how well do they now please me  these higher men    but he did not
say it aloud  for he respected their happiness and their silence   

then  however  there happened that which in this astonishing long day
was most astonishing  the ugliest man began once more and for the last
time to gurgle and snort  and when he had at length found expression 
behold  there sprang a question plump and plain out of his mouth  a
good  deep  clear question  which moved the hearts of all who listened
to him 

 my friends  all of you   said the ugliest man   what think ye  for the
sake of this day   i  am for the first time content to have lived mine
entire life 

and that i testify so much is still not enough for me  it is worth while
living on the earth  one day  one festival with zarathustra  hath taught
me to love the earth 

 was that  life   will i say unto death   well  once more  

my friends  what think ye  will ye not  like me  say unto death   was
that  life  for the sake of zarathustra  well  once more     

thus spake the ugliest man  it was not  however  far from midnight 
and what took place then  think ye  as soon as the higher men heard his
question  they became all at once conscious of their transformation and
convalescence  and of him who was the cause thereof  then did they rush
up to zarathustra  thanking  honouring  caressing him  and kissing his
hands  each in his own peculiar way  so that some laughed and some wept 
the old soothsayer  however  danced with delight  and though he was
then  as some narrators suppose  full of sweet wine  he was certainly
still fuller of sweet life  and had renounced all weariness  there are
even those who narrate that the ass then danced  for not in vain had the
ugliest man previously given it wine to drink  that may be the case  or
it may be otherwise  and if in truth the ass did not dance that evening 
there nevertheless happened then greater and rarer wonders than
the dancing of an ass would have been  in short  as the proverb of
zarathustra saith   what doth it matter  

2 

when  however  this took place with the ugliest man  zarathustra stood
there like one drunken  his glance dulled  his tongue faltered and his
feet staggered  and who could divine what thoughts then passed through
zarathustra s soul  apparently  however  his spirit retreated and fled
in advance and was in remote distances  and as it were  wandering on
high mountain ridges   as it standeth written    twixt two seas 

  wandering  twixt the past and the future as a heavy cloud   gradually 
however  while the higher men held him in their arms  he came back to
himself a little  and resisted with his hands the crowd of the honouring
and caring ones  but he did not speak  all at once  however  he turned
his head quickly  for he seemed to hear something  then laid he his
finger on his mouth and said   come  

and immediately it became still and mysterious round about  from
the depth however there came up slowly the sound of a clock bell 
zarathustra listened thereto  like the higher men  then  however  laid
he his finger on his mouth the second time  and said again   come  come 
it is getting on to midnight    and his voice had changed  but still
he had not moved from the spot  then it became yet stiller and more
mysterious  and everything hearkened  even the ass  and zarathustra s
noble animals  the eagle and the serpent   likewise the cave of
zarathustra and the big cool moon  and the night itself  zarathustra 
however  laid his hand upon his mouth for the third time  and said 

come  come  come  let us now wander  it is the hour  let us wander into
the night 

3 

ye higher men  it is getting on to midnight  then will i say something
into your ears  as that old clock bell saith it into mine ear   

  as mysteriously  as frightfully  and as cordially as that midnight
clock bell speaketh it to me  which hath experienced more than one man 

  which hath already counted the smarting throbbings of your fathers 
hearts  ah  ah  how it sigheth  how it laugheth in its dream  the old 
deep  deep midnight 

hush  hush  then is there many a thing heard which may not be heard
by day  now however  in the cool air  when even all the tumult of your
hearts hath become still   

  now doth it speak  now is it heard  now doth it steal into
overwakeful  nocturnal souls  ah  ah  how the midnight sigheth  how it
laugheth in its dream 

  hearest thou not how it mysteriously  frightfully  and cordially
speaketh unto thee  the old deep  deep midnight 

o man  take heed 

4 

woe to me  whither hath time gone  have i not sunk into deep wells  the
world sleepeth  

ah  ah  the dog howleth  the moon shineth  rather will i die  rather
will i die  than say unto you what my midnight heart now thinketh 

already have i died  it is all over  spider  why spinnest thou around
me  wilt thou have blood  ah  ah  the dew falleth  the hour cometh  

  the hour in which i frost and freeze  which asketh and asketh and
asketh   who hath sufficient courage for it 

  who is to be master of the world  who is going to say  thus shall ye
flow  ye great and small streams  

  the hour approacheth  o man  thou higher man  take heed  this talk is
for fine ears  for thine ears  what saith deep midnight s voice indeed 

5 

it carrieth me away  my soul danceth  day s work  day s work  who is to
be master of the world 

the moon is cool  the wind is still  ah  ah  have ye already flown high
enough  ye have danced  a leg  nevertheless  is not a wing 

ye good dancers  now is all delight over  wine hath become lees  every
cup hath become brittle  the sepulchres mutter 

ye have not flown high enough  now do the sepulchres mutter   free the
dead  why is it so long night  doth not the moon make us drunken  

ye higher men  free the sepulchres  awaken the corpses  ah  why doth the
worm still burrow  there approacheth  there approacheth  the hour   

  there boometh the clock bell  there thrilleth still the heart  there
burroweth still the wood worm  the heart worm  ah  ah  the world is
deep 

6 

sweet lyre  sweet lyre  i love thy tone  thy drunken  ranunculine
tone   how long  how far hath come unto me thy tone  from the distance 
from the ponds of love 

thou old clock bell  thou sweet lyre  every pain hath torn thy heart 
father pain  fathers  pain  forefathers  pain  thy speech hath become
ripe   

  ripe like the golden autumn and the afternoon  like mine anchorite
heart  now sayest thou  the world itself hath become ripe  the grape
turneth brown 

  now doth it wish to die  to die of happiness  ye higher men  do ye not
feel it  there welleth up mysteriously an odour 

  a perfume and odour of eternity  a rosy blessed  brown 
gold wine odour of old happiness 

  of drunken midnight death happiness  which singeth  the world is deep 
and deeper than the day could read 

7 

leave me alone  leave me alone  i am too pure for thee  touch me not 
hath not my world just now become perfect 

my skin is too pure for thy hands  leave me alone  thou dull  doltish 
stupid day  is not the midnight brighter 

the purest are to be masters of the world  the least known  the
strongest  the midnight souls  who are brighter and deeper than any day 

o day  thou gropest for me  thou feelest for my happiness  for thee am i
rich  lonesome  a treasure pit  a gold chamber 

o world  thou wantest me  am i worldly for thee  am i spiritual for
thee  am i divine for thee  but day and world  ye are too coarse   

  have cleverer hands  grasp after deeper happiness  after deeper
unhappiness  grasp after some god  grasp not after me 

  mine unhappiness  my happiness is deep  thou strange day  but yet am i
no god  no god s hell  deep is its woe 

8 

god s woe is deeper  thou strange world  grasp at god s woe  not at me 
what am i  a drunken sweet lyre   

  a midnight lyre  a bell frog  which no one understandeth  but which
must speak before deaf ones  ye higher men  for ye do not understand me 

gone  gone  o youth  o noontide  o afternoon  now have come evening and
night and midnight   the dog howleth  the wind 

  is the wind not a dog  it whineth  it barketh  it howleth  ah  ah 
how she sigheth  how she laugheth  how she wheezeth and panteth  the
midnight 

how she just now speaketh soberly  this drunken poetess  hath she
perhaps overdrunk her drunkenness  hath she become overawake  doth she
ruminate 

  her woe doth she ruminate over  in a dream  the old  deep
midnight  and still more her joy  for joy  although woe be deep  joy is
deeper still than grief can be 

9 

thou grape vine  why dost thou praise me  have i not cut thee  i am
cruel  thou bleedest    what meaneth thy praise of my drunken cruelty 

 whatever hath become perfect  everything mature  wanteth to die   so
sayest thou  blessed  blessed be the vintner s knife  but everything
immature wanteth to live  alas 

woe saith   hence  go  away  thou woe   but everything that suffereth
wanteth to live  that it may become mature and lively and longing 

  longing for the further  the higher  the brighter   i want heirs  
 so saith everything that suffereth   i want children  i do not want
myself    

joy  however  doth not want heirs  it doth not want children   joy
wanteth itself  it wanteth eternity  it wanteth recurrence  it wanteth
everything eternally like itself 

woe saith   break  bleed  thou heart  wander  thou leg  thou wing  fly 
onward  upward  thou pain   well  cheer up  o mine old heart  woe saith 
 hence  go  

10 

ye higher men  what think ye  am i a soothsayer  or a dreamer  or a
drunkard  or a dream reader  or a midnight bell 

or a drop of dew  or a fume and fragrance of eternity  hear ye it not 
smell ye it not  just now hath my world become perfect  midnight is also
mid day   

pain is also a joy  curse is also a blessing  night is also a sun   go
away  or ye will learn that a sage is also a fool 

said ye ever yea to one joy  o my friends  then said ye yea also unto
all woe  all things are enlinked  enlaced and enamoured   

  wanted ye ever once to come twice  said ye ever   thou pleasest me 
happiness  instant  moment   then wanted ye all to come back again 

  all anew  all eternal  all enlinked  enlaced and enamoured  oh  then
did ye love the world   

  ye eternal ones  ye love it eternally and for all time  and also unto
woe do ye say  hence  go  but come back  for joys all want  eternity 

11 

all joy wanteth the eternity of all things  it wanteth honey  it
wanteth lees  it wanteth drunken midnight  it wanteth graves  it wanteth
grave tears  consolation  it wanteth gilded evening red  

  what doth not joy want  it is thirstier  heartier  hungrier  more
frightful  more mysterious  than all woe  it wanteth itself  it biteth
into itself  the ring s will writheth in it   

  it wanteth love  it wanteth hate  it is over rich  it bestoweth  it
throweth away  it beggeth for some one to take from it  it thanketh the
taker  it would fain be hated   

  so rich is joy that it thirsteth for woe  for hell  for hate  for
shame  for the lame  for the world   for this world  oh  ye know it
indeed 

ye higher men  for you doth it long  this joy  this irrepressible 
blessed joy  for your woe  ye failures  for failures  longeth all
eternal joy 

for joys all want themselves  therefore do they also want grief  o
happiness  o pain  oh break  thou heart  ye higher men  do learn it 
that joys want eternity 

  joys want the eternity of all things  they want deep  profound
eternity 

12 

have ye now learned my song  have ye divined what it would say  well 
cheer up  ye higher men  sing now my roundelay 

sing now yourselves the song  the name of which is  once more   the
signification of which is  unto all eternity    sing  ye higher men 
zarathustra s roundelay 

     o man   take heed 
     what saith deep midnight s voice indeed 
      i slept my sleep   
      from deepest dream i ve woke  and plead   
      the world is deep 
      and deeper than the day could read 
      deep is its woe   
      joy  deeper still than grief can be 
      woe saith   hence   go 
      but joys all want eternity  
       want deep  profound eternity  




lxxx  the sign 

in the morning  however  after this night  zarathustra jumped up from
his couch  and  having girded his loins  he came out of his cave glowing
and strong  like a morning sun coming out of gloomy mountains 

 thou great star   spake he  as he had spoken once before   thou deep
eye of happiness  what would be all thy happiness if thou hadst not
those for whom thou shinest 

and if they remained in their chambers whilst thou art already awake 
and comest and bestowest and distributest  how would thy proud modesty
upbraid for it 

well  they still sleep  these higher men  whilst  i  am awake  they are
not my proper companions  not for them do i wait here in my mountains 

at my work i want to be  at my day  but they understand not what are the
signs of my morning  my step  is not for them the awakening call 

they still sleep in my cave  their dream still drinketh at my drunken
songs  the audient ear for me  the obedient ear  is yet lacking in their
limbs  

  this had zarathustra spoken to his heart when the sun arose  then
looked he inquiringly aloft  for he heard above him the sharp call of
his eagle   well   called he upwards   thus is it pleasing and proper to
me  mine animals are awake  for i am awake 

mine eagle is awake  and like me honoureth the sun  with eagle talons
doth it grasp at the new light  ye are my proper animals  i love you 

but still do i lack my proper men    

thus spake zarathustra  then  however  it happened that all on a sudden
he became aware that he was flocked around and fluttered around  as if
by innumerable birds   the whizzing of so many wings  however  and the
crowding around his head was so great that he shut his eyes  and verily 
there came down upon him as it were a cloud  like a cloud of arrows
which poureth upon a new enemy  but behold  here it was a cloud of love 
and showered upon a new friend 

 what happeneth unto me   thought zarathustra in his astonished heart 
and slowly seated himself on the big stone which lay close to the exit
from his cave  but while he grasped about with his hands  around him 
above him and below him  and repelled the tender birds  behold  there
then happened to him something still stranger  for he grasped thereby
unawares into a mass of thick  warm  shaggy hair  at the same time 
however  there sounded before him a roar   a long  soft lion roar 

 the sign cometh   said zarathustra  and a change came over his heart 
and in truth  when it turned clear before him  there lay a yellow 
powerful animal at his feet  resting its head on his knee   unwilling to
leave him out of love  and doing like a dog which again findeth its old
master  the doves  however  were no less eager with their love than the
lion  and whenever a dove whisked over its nose  the lion shook its head
and wondered and laughed 

when all this went on zarathustra spake only a word   my children are
nigh  my children     then he became quite mute  his heart  however 
was loosed  and from his eyes there dropped down tears and fell upon
his hands  and he took no further notice of anything  but sat there
motionless  without repelling the animals further  then flew the doves
to and fro  and perched on his shoulder  and caressed his white hair 
and did not tire of their tenderness and joyousness  the strong lion 
however  licked always the tears that fell on zarathustra s hands  and
roared and growled shyly  thus did these animals do   

all this went on for a long time  or a short time  for properly
speaking  there is no time on earth for such things    meanwhile 
however  the higher men had awakened in zarathustra s cave  and
marshalled themselves for a procession to go to meet zarathustra  and
give him their morning greeting  for they had found when they awakened
that he no longer tarried with them  when  however  they reached the
door of the cave and the noise of their steps had preceded them  the
lion started violently  it turned away all at once from zarathustra  and
roaring wildly  sprang towards the cave  the higher men  however  when
they heard the lion roaring  cried all aloud as with one voice  fled
back and vanished in an instant 

zarathustra himself  however  stunned and strange  rose from his seat 
looked around him  stood there astonished  inquired of his heart 
bethought himself  and remained alone   what did i hear   said he at
last  slowly   what happened unto me just now  

but soon there came to him his recollection  and he took in at a glance
all that had taken place between yesterday and to day   here is indeed
the stone   said he  and stroked his beard   on it sat i yester morn 
and here came the soothsayer unto me  and here heard i first the cry
which i heard just now  the great cry of distress 

o ye higher men  your distress was it that the old soothsayer foretold
to me yester morn   

  unto your distress did he want to seduce and tempt me   o
zarathustra   said he to me   i come to seduce thee to thy last sin  

to my last sin   cried zarathustra  and laughed angrily at his own
words   what hath been reserved for me as my last sin  

  and once more zarathustra became absorbed in himself  and sat down
again on the big stone and meditated  suddenly he sprang up   

 fellow suffering  fellow suffering with the higher men   he cried out 
and his countenance changed into brass   well  that  hath had its time 

my suffering and my fellow suffering  what matter about them  do i then
strive after happiness  i strive after my work 

well  the lion hath come  my children are nigh  zarathustra hath grown
ripe  mine hour hath come   

this is my morning  my day beginneth  arise now  arise  thou great
noontide    

thus spake zarathustra and left his cave  glowing and strong  like a
morning sun coming out of gloomy mountains 




appendix 

notes on  thus spake zarathustra  by anthony m  ludovici 

i have had some opportunities of studying the conditions under which
nietzsche is read in germany  france  and england  and i have found
that  in each of these countries  students of his philosophy  as if
actuated by precisely similar motives and desires  and misled by the
same mistaken tactics on the part of most publishers  all proceed in the
same happy go lucky style when  taking him up   they have had it said to
them that he wrote without any system  and they very naturally conclude
that it does not matter in the least whether they begin with his first 
third  or last book  provided they can obtain a few vague ideas as to
what his leading and most sensational principles were 

now  it is clear that the book with the most mysterious  startling  or
suggestive title  will always stand the best chance of being purchased
by those who have no other criteria to guide them in their choice
than the aspect of a title page  and this explains why  thus spake
zarathustra  is almost always the first and often the only one of
nietzsche s books that falls into the hands of the uninitiated 

the title suggests all kinds of mysteries  a glance at the
chapter headings quickly confirms the suspicions already aroused 
and the sub title   a book for all and none   generally succeeds in
dissipating the last doubts the prospective purchaser may entertain
concerning his fitness for the book or its fitness for him  and what
happens 

 thus spake zarathustra  is taken home  the reader  who perchance may
know no more concerning nietzsche than a magazine article has told him 
tries to read it and  understanding less than half he reads  probably
never gets further than the second or third part   and then only to feel
convinced that nietzsche himself was  rather hazy  as to what he was
talking about  such chapters as  the child with the mirror    in the
happy isles    the grave song    immaculate perception    the stillest
hour    the seven seals   and many others  are almost utterly devoid of
meaning to all those who do not know something of nietzsche s life  his
aims and his friendships 

as a matter of fact   thus spake zarathustra   though it is
unquestionably nietzsche s opus magnum  is by no means the first of
nietzsche s works that the beginner ought to undertake to read  the
author himself refers to it as the deepest work ever offered to the
german public  and elsewhere speaks of his other writings as being
necessary for the understanding of it  but when it is remembered that
in zarathustra we not only have the history of his most intimate
experiences  friendships  feuds  disappointments  triumphs and the like 
but that the very form in which they are narrated is one which tends
rather to obscure than to throw light upon them  the difficulties which
meet the reader who starts quite unprepared will be seen to be really
formidable 

zarathustra  then   this shadowy  allegorical personality  speaking in
allegories and parables  and at times not even refraining from relating
his own dreams  is a figure we can understand but very imperfectly if we
have no knowledge of his creator and counterpart  friedrich nietzsche 
and it were therefore well  previous to our study of the more abstruse
parts of this book  if we were to turn to some authoritative book on
nietzsche s life and works and to read all that is there said on the
subject  those who can read german will find an excellent guide  in this
respect  in frau foerster nietzsche s exhaustive and highly interesting
biography of her brother   das leben friedrich nietzsche s   published
by naumann   while the works of deussen  raoul richter  and baroness
isabelle von unger sternberg  will be found to throw useful and
necessary light upon many questions which it would be difficult for a
sister to touch upon 

in regard to the actual philosophical views expounded in this work 
there is an excellent way of clearing up any difficulties they may
present  and that is by an appeal to nietzsche s other works  again and
again  of course  he will be found to express himself so clearly that
all reference to his other writings may be dispensed with  but where
this is not the case  the advice he himself gives is after all the best
to be followed here  viz    to regard such works as   joyful science  
 beyond good and evil    the genealogy of morals    the twilight of
the idols    the antichrist    the will to power   etc   etc   as the
necessary preparation for  thus spake zarathustra  

these directions  though they are by no means simple to carry out  seem
at least to possess the quality of definiteness and straightforwardness 
 follow them and all will be clear   i seem to imply  but i regret to
say that this is not really the case  for my experience tells me that
even after the above directions have been followed with the greatest
possible zeal  the student will still halt in perplexity before certain
passages in the book before us  and wonder what they mean  now  it is
with the view of giving a little additional help to all those who find
themselves in this position that i proceed to put forth my own personal
interpretation of the more abstruse passages in this work 

in offering this little commentary to the nietzsche student  i should
like it to be understood that i make no claim as to its infallibility or
indispensability  it represents but an attempt on my part  a very feeble
one perhaps  to give the reader what little help i can in surmounting
difficulties which a long study of nietzsche s life and works has
enabled me  partially i hope  to overcome 

   

perhaps it would be as well to start out with a broad and rapid sketch
of nietzsche as a writer on morals  evolution  and sociology  so that
the reader may be prepared to pick out for himself  so to speak  all
passages in this work bearing in any way upon nietzsche s views in those
three important branches of knowledge 

 a   nietzsche and morality 

in morality  nietzsche starts out by adopting the position of the
relativist  he says there are no absolute values  good  and  evil  
these are mere means adopted by all in order to acquire power to
maintain their place in the world  or to become supreme  it is the
lion s good to devour an antelope  it is the dead leaf butterfly s
good to tell a foe a falsehood  for when the dead leaf butterfly is in
danger  it clings to the side of a twig  and what it says to its foe is
practically this   i am not a butterfly  i am a dead leaf  and can be
of no use to thee   this is a lie which is good to the butterfly  for
it preserves it  in nature every species of organic being instinctively
adopts and practises those acts which most conduce to the prevalence
or supremacy of its kind  once the most favourable order of conduct is
found  proved efficient and established  it becomes the ruling morality
of the species that adopts it and bears them along to victory  all
species must not and cannot value alike  for what is the lion s good is
the antelope s evil and vice versa 

concepts of good and evil are therefore  in their origin  merely a means
to an end  they are expedients for acquiring power 

applying this principle to mankind  nietzsche attacked christian
moral values  he declared them to be  like all other morals  merely
an expedient for protecting a certain type of man  in the case of
christianity this type was  according to nietzsche  a low one 

conflicting moral codes have been no more than the conflicting weapons
of different classes of men  for in mankind there is a continual war
between the powerful  the noble  the strong  and the well constituted
on the one side  and the impotent  the mean  the weak  and the
ill constituted on the other  the war is a war of moral principles 
the morality of the powerful class  nietzsche calls noble  or
master morality  that of the weak and subordinate class he calls
slave morality  in the first morality it is the eagle which  looking
down upon a browsing lamb  contends that  eating lamb is good   in the
second  the slave morality  it is the lamb which  looking up from the
sward  bleats dissentingly   eating lamb is evil  

 b   the master  and slave morality compared 

the first morality is active  creative  dionysian  the second is
passive  defensive   to it belongs the  struggle for existence  

where attempts have not been made to reconcile the two moralities  they
may be described as follows   all is good in the noble morality which
proceeds from strength  power  health  well constitutedness  happiness 
and awfulness  for  the motive force behind the people practising it is
 the struggle for power   the antithesis  good and bad  to this
first class means the same as  noble  and  despicable    bad  in the
master morality must be applied to the coward  to all acts that spring
from weakness  to the man with  an eye to the main chance   who would
forsake everything in order to live 

with the second  the slave morality  the case is different  there 
inasmuch as the community is an oppressed  suffering  unemancipated  and
weary one  all that will be held to be good which alleviates the
state of suffering  pity  the obliging hand  the warm heart  patience 
industry  and humility  these are unquestionably the qualities we shall
here find flooded with the light of approval and admiration  because
they are the most useful qualities    they make life endurable  they are
of assistance in the  struggle for existence  which is the motive force
behind the people practising this morality  to this class  all that is
awful is bad  in fact it is the evil par excellence  strength  health 
superabundance of animal spirits and power  are regarded with hate 
suspicion  and fear by the subordinate class 

now nietzsche believed that the first or the noble morality conduced to
an ascent in the line of life  because it was creative and active  on
the other hand  he believed that the second or slave morality  where
it became paramount  led to degeneration  because it was passive and
defensive  wanting merely to keep those who practised it alive  hence
his earnest advocacy of noble morality 

 c   nietzsche and evolution 

nietzsche as an evolutionist i shall have occasion to define and discuss
in the course of these notes  see notes on chapter lvi   par 10  and on
chapter lvii    for the present let it suffice for us to know that he
accepted the  development hypothesis  as an explanation of the origin of
species  but he did not halt where most naturalists have halted  he
by no means regarded man as the highest possible being which evolution
could arrive at  for though his physical development may have reached
its limit  this is not the case with his mental or spiritual attributes 
if the process be a fact  if things have become what they are  then  he
contends  we may describe no limit to man s aspirations  if he struggled
up from barbarism  and still more remotely from the lower primates 
his ideal should be to surpass man himself and reach superman  see
especially the prologue  

 d   nietzsche and sociology 

nietzsche as a sociologist aims at an aristocratic arrangement of
society  he would have us rear an ideal race  honest and truthful in
intellectual matters  he could not even think that men are equal   with
these preachers of equality will i not be mixed up and confounded  for
thus speaketh justice unto me   men are not equal    he sees precisely
in this inequality a purpose to be served  a condition to be exploited 
 every elevation of the type  man    he writes in  beyond good and
evil    has hitherto been the work of an aristocratic society  and so
will it always be  a society believing in a long scale of gradations of
rank and differences of worth among human beings  

those who are sufficiently interested to desire to read his own detailed
account of the society he would fain establish  will find an excellent
passage in aphorism 57 of  the antichrist  

   

part i  the prologue 

in part i  including the prologue  no very great difficulties will
appear  zarathustra s habit of designating a whole class of men or a
whole school of thought by a single fitting nickname may perhaps lead to
a little confusion at first  but  as a rule  when the general drift
of his arguments is grasped  it requires but a slight effort of the
imagination to discover whom he is referring to  in the ninth paragraph
of the prologue  for instance  it is quite obvious that  herdsmen  in
the verse  herdsmen  i say  etc   etc    stands for all those to day
who are the advocates of gregariousness  of the ant hill  and when our
author says   a robber shall zarathustra be called by the herdsmen   it
is clear that these words may be taken almost literally from one whose
ideal was the rearing of a higher aristocracy  again   the good and
just   throughout the book  is the expression used in referring to the
self righteous of modern times   those who are quite sure that they
know all that is to be known concerning good and evil  and are satisfied
that the values their little world of tradition has handed down to them 
are destined to rule mankind as long as it lasts 

in the last paragraph of the prologue  verse 7  zarathustra gives us a
foretaste of his teaching concerning the big and the little sagacities 
expounded subsequently  he says he would he were as wise as his serpent 
this desire will be found explained in the discourse entitled  the
despisers of the body   which i shall have occasion to refer to later 

   

the discourses 

chapter i  the three metamorphoses 

this opening discourse is a parable in which zarathustra discloses the
mental development of all creators of new values  it is the story of
a life which reaches its consummation in attaining to a second
ingenuousness or in returning to childhood  nietzsche  the supposed
anarchist  here plainly disclaims all relationship whatever to anarchy 
for he shows us that only by bearing the burdens of the existing law and
submitting to it patiently  as the camel submits to being laden  does
the free spirit acquire that ascendancy over tradition which enables him
to meet and master the dragon  thou shalt    the dragon with the values
of a thousand years glittering on its scales  there are two lessons in
this discourse  first  that in order to create one must be as a little
child  secondly  that it is only through existing law and order that
one attains to that height from which new law and new order may be
promulgated 

chapter ii  the academic chairs of virtue 

almost the whole of this is quite comprehensible  it is a discourse
against all those who confound virtue with tameness and smug ease  and
who regard as virtuous only that which promotes security and tends to
deepen sleep 

chapter iv  the despisers of the body 

here zarathustra gives names to the intellect and the instincts  he
calls the one  the little sagacity  and the latter  the big sagacity  
 schopenhauer s teaching concerning the intellect is fully endorsed here 
 an instrument of thy body is also thy little sagacity  my brother 
which thou callest  spirit    says zarathustra  from beginning to end it
is a warning to those who would think too lightly of the instincts
and unduly exalt the intellect and its derivatives  reason and
understanding 

chapter ix  the preachers of death 

this is an analysis of the psychology of all those who have the  evil
eye  and are pessimists by virtue of their constitutions 

chapter xv  the thousand and one goals 

in this discourse zarathustra opens his exposition of the doctrine of
relativity in morality  and declares all morality to be a mere means
to power  needless to say that verses 9  10  11  and 12 refer to the
greeks  the persians  the jews  and the germans respectively  in the
penultimate verse he makes known his discovery concerning the root of
modern nihilism and indifference   i e   that modern man has no goal  no
aim  no ideals  see note a  

chapter xviii  old and young women 

nietzsche s views on women have either to be loved at first sight
or they become perhaps the greatest obstacle in the way of those who
otherwise would be inclined to accept his philosophy  women especially 
of course  have been taught to dislike them  because it has been
rumoured that his views are unfriendly to themselves  now  to my mind 
all this is pure misunderstanding and error 

german philosophers  thanks to schopenhauer  have earned rather a bad
name for their views on women  it is almost impossible for one of them
to write a line on the subject  however kindly he may do so  without
being suspected of wishing to open a crusade against the fair sex 
despite the fact  therefore  that all nietzsche s views in this respect
were dictated to him by the profoundest love  despite zarathustra s
reservation in this discourse  that  with women nothing  that can be
said  is impossible   and in the face of other overwhelming evidence
to the contrary  nietzsche is universally reported to have mis son
pied dans le plat  where the female sex is concerned  and what is the
fundamental doctrine which has given rise to so much bitterness and
aversion   merely this  that the sexes are at bottom antagonistic  that
is to say  as different as blue is from yellow  and that the best
possible means of rearing anything approaching a desirable race is to
preserve and to foster this profound hostility  what nietzsche strives
to combat and to overthrow is the modern democratic tendency which is
slowly labouring to level all things  even the sexes  his quarrel is not
with women  what indeed could be more undignified   it is with those who
would destroy the natural relationship between the sexes  by modifying
either the one or the other with a view to making them more alike  the
human world is just as dependent upon women s powers as upon men s  it
is women s strongest and most valuable instincts which help to determine
who are to be the fathers of the next generation  by destroying these
particular instincts  that is to say by attempting to masculinise woman 
and to feminise men  we jeopardise the future of our people  the general
democratic movement of modern times  in its frantic struggle to mitigate
all differences  is now invading even the world of sex  it is against
this movement that nietzsche raises his voice  he would have woman
become ever more woman and man become ever more man  only thus  and
he is undoubtedly right  can their combined instincts lead to the
excellence of humanity  regarded in this light  all his views on woman
appear not only necessary but just  see note on chapter lvi   par  21  

it is interesting to observe that the last line of the discourse  which
has so frequently been used by women as a weapon against nietzsche s
views concerning them  was suggested to nietzsche by a woman  see  das
leben f  nietzsche s   

chapter xxi  voluntary death 

in regard to this discourse  i should only like to point out that
nietzsche had a particular aversion to the word  suicide   self murder 
he disliked the evil it suggested  and in rechristening the act
voluntary death  i e   the death that comes from no other hand than
one s own  he was desirous of elevating it to the position it held in
classical antiquity  see aphorism 36 in  the twilight of the idols   

chapter xxii  the bestowing virtue 

an important aspect of nietzsche s philosophy is brought to light in
this discourse  his teaching  as is well known  places the aristotelian
man of spirit  above all others in the natural divisions of man  the
man with overflowing strength  both of mind and body  who must discharge
this strength or perish  is the nietzschean ideal  to such a man  giving
from his overflow becomes a necessity  bestowing develops into a means
of existence  and this is the only giving  the only charity  that
nietzsche recognises  in paragraph 3 of the discourse  we read
zarathustra s healthy exhortation to his disciples to become independent
thinkers and to find themselves before they learn any more from him  see
notes on chapters lvi   par  5  and lxxiii   pars  10  11  

   

part ii 

chapter xxiii  the child with the mirror 

nietzsche tells us here  in a poetical form  how deeply grieved he was
by the manifold misinterpretations and misunderstandings which were
becoming rife concerning his publications  he does not recognise
himself in the mirror of public opinion  and recoils terrified from the
distorted reflection of his features  in verse 20 he gives us a
hint which it were well not to pass over too lightly  for  in the
introduction to  the genealogy of morals   written in 1887  he finds it
necessary to refer to the matter again and with greater precision  the
point is this  that a creator of new values meets with his surest and
strongest obstacles in the very spirit of the language which is at his
disposal  words  like all other manifestations of an evolving race  are
stamped with the values that have long been paramount in that race 
now  the original thinker who finds himself compelled to use the current
speech of his country in order to impart new and hitherto untried views
to his fellows  imposes a task upon the natural means of communication
which it is totally unfitted to perform   hence the obscurities and
prolixities which are so frequently met with in the writings of original
thinkers  in the  dawn of day   nietzsche actually cautions young
writers against the danger of allowing their thoughts to be moulded by
the words at their disposal 

chapter xxiv  in the happy isles 

while writing this  nietzsche is supposed to have been thinking of the
island of ischia which was ultimately destroyed by an earthquake  his
teaching here is quite clear  he was among the first thinkers of europe
to overcome the pessimism which godlessness generally brings in its
wake  he points to creating as the surest salvation from the suffering
which is a concomitant of all higher life   what would there be to
create   he asks   if there were  gods   his ideal  the superman  lends
him the cheerfulness necessary to the overcoming of that despair usually
attendant upon godlessness and upon the apparent aimlessness of a world
without a god 

chapter xxix  the tarantulas 

the tarantulas are the socialists and democrats  this discourse offers
us an analysis of their mental attitude  nietzsche refuses to be
confounded with those resentful and revengeful ones who condemn society
from below  and whose criticism is only suppressed envy   there are
those who preach my doctrine of life   he says of the nietzschean
socialists   and are at the same time preachers of equality and
tarantulas   see notes on chapter xl  and chapter li   

chapter xxx  the famous wise ones 

this refers to all those philosophers hitherto  who have run in the
harness of established values and have not risked their reputation with
the people in pursuit of truth  the philosopher  however  as nietzsche
understood him  is a man who creates new values  and thus leads mankind
in a new direction 

chapter xxxiii  the grave song 

here zarathustra sings about the ideals and friendships of his youth 
verses 27 to 31 undoubtedly refer to richard wagner  see note on chapter
lxv   

chapter xxxiv  self surpassing 

in this discourse we get the best exposition in the whole book of
nietzsche s doctrine of the will to power  i go into this question
thoroughly in the note on chapter lvii 

nietzsche was not an iconoclast from choice  those who hastily class him
with the anarchists  or the progressivists of the last century  fail
to understand the high esteem in which he always held both law and
discipline  in verse 41 of this most decisive discourse he truly
explains his position when he says      he who hath to be a creator in
good and evil  verily he hath first to be a destroyer  and break values
in pieces   this teaching in regard to self control is evidence enough
of his reverence for law 

chapter xxxv  the sublime ones 

these belong to a type which nietzsche did not altogether dislike  but
which he would fain have rendered more subtle and plastic  it is the
type that takes life and itself too seriously  that never surmounts the
camel stage mentioned in the first discourse  and that is obdurately
sublime and earnest  to be able to smile while speaking of lofty things
and not to be oppressed by them  is the secret of real greatness  he
whose hand trembles when it lays hold of a beautiful thing  has the
quality of reverence  without the artist s unembarrassed friendship
with the beautiful  hence the mistakes which have arisen in regard to
confounding nietzsche with his extreme opposites the anarchists and
agitators  for what they dare to touch and break with the impudence
and irreverence of the unappreciative  he seems likewise to touch and
break   but with other fingers  with the fingers of the loving and
unembarrassed artist who is on good terms with the beautiful and who
feels able to create it and to enhance it with his touch  the question
of taste plays an important part in nietzsche s philosophy  and verses
9  10 of this discourse exactly state nietzsche s ultimate views on the
subject  in the  spirit of gravity   he actually cries    neither a good
nor a bad taste  but my taste  of which i have no longer either shame or
secrecy  

chapter xxxvi  the land of culture 

this is a poetical epitome of some of the scathing criticism of
scholars which appears in the first of the  thoughts out of season   the
polemical pamphlet  written in 1873  against david strauss and his
school  he reproaches his former colleagues with being sterile and
shows them that their sterility is the result of their not believing
in anything   he who had to create  had always his presaging dreams and
astral premonitions  and believed in believing    see note on chapter
lxxvii   in the last two verses he reveals the nature of his altruism 
how far it differs from that of christianity we have already read in the
discourse  neighbour love   but here he tells us definitely the nature
of his love to mankind  he explains why he was compelled to assail the
christian values of pity and excessive love of the neighbour  not only
because they are slave values and therefore tend to promote degeneration
 see note b    but because he could only love his children s land  the
undiscovered land in a remote sea  because he would fain retrieve the
errors of his fathers in his children 

chapter xxxvii  immaculate perception 

an important feature of nietzsche s interpretation of life is disclosed
in this discourse  as buckle suggests in his  influence of women on the
progress of knowledge   the scientific spirit of the investigator is
both helped and supplemented by the latter s emotions and personality 
and the divorce of all emotionalism and individual temperament from
science is a fatal step towards sterility  zarathustra abjures all those
who would fain turn an impersonal eye upon nature and contemplate her
phenomena with that pure objectivity to which the scientific idealists
of to day would so much like to attain  he accuses such idealists of
hypocrisy and guile  he says they lack innocence in their desires and
therefore slander all desiring 

chapter xxxviii  scholars 

this is a record of nietzsche s final breach with his former
colleagues  the scholars of germany  already after the publication of
the  birth of tragedy   numbers of german philologists and professional
philosophers had denounced him as one who had strayed too far from
their flock  and his lectures at the university of bale were deserted
in consequence  but it was not until 1879  when he finally severed all
connection with university work  that he may be said to have attained to
the freedom and independence which stamp this discourse 

chapter xxxix  poets 

people have sometimes said that nietzsche had no sense of humour  i
have no intention of defending him here against such foolish critics  i
should only like to point out to the reader that we have him here at
his best  poking fun at himself  and at his fellow poets  see note on
chapter lxiii   pars  16  17  18  19  20  

chapter xl  great events 

here we seem to have a puzzle  zarathustra himself  while relating
his experience with the fire dog to his disciples  fails to get them
interested in his narrative  and we also may be only too ready to turn
over these pages under the impression that they are little more than
a mere phantasy or poetical flight  zarathustra s interview with the
fire dog is  however  of great importance  in it we find nietzsche
face to face with the creature he most sincerely loathes  the spirit
of revolution  and we obtain fresh hints concerning his hatred of the
anarchist and rebel    freedom  ye all roar most eagerly   he says to
the fire dog   but i have unlearned the belief in  great events  when
there is much roaring and smoke about them  not around the inventors
of new noise  but around the inventors of new values  doth the world
revolve  inaudibly it revolveth  

chapter xli  the soothsayer 

this refers  of course  to schopenhauer  nietzsche  as is well known 
was at one time an ardent follower of schopenhauer  he overcame
pessimism by discovering an object in existence  he saw the possibility
of raising society to a higher level and preached the profoundest
optimism in consequence 

chapter xlii  redemption 

zarathustra here addresses cripples  he tells them of other
cripples  the great men in this world who have one organ or faculty
inordinately developed at the cost of their other faculties  this is
doubtless a reference to a fact which is too often noticeable in the
case of so many of the world s giants in art  science  or religion  in
verse 19 we are told what nietzsche called redemption  that is to say 
the ability to say of all that is past   thus would i have it   the
in ability to say this  and the resentment which results therefrom 
he regards as the source of all our feelings of revenge  and all our
desires to punish  punishment meaning to him merely a euphemism for the
word revenge  invented in order to still our consciences  he who can be
proud of his enemies  who can be grateful to them for the obstacles they
have put in his way  he who can regard his worst calamity as but the
extra strain on the bow of his life  which is to send the arrow of
his longing even further than he could have hoped   this man knows no
revenge  neither does he know despair  he truly has found redemption and
can turn on the worst in his life and even in himself  and call it his
best  see notes on chapter lvii   

chapter xliii  manly prudence 

this discourse is very important  in  beyond good and evil  we hear
often enough that the select and superior man must wear a mask  and
here we find this injunction explained   and he who would not languish
amongst men  must learn to drink out of all glasses  and he who would
keep clean amongst men  must know how to wash himself even with dirty
water   this  i venture to suggest  requires some explanation  at a time
when individuality is supposed to be shown most tellingly by putting
boots on one s hands and gloves on one s feet  it is somewhat refreshing
to come across a true individualist who feels the chasm between himself
and others so deeply  that he must perforce adapt himself to them
outwardly  at least  in all respects  so that the inner difference
should be overlooked  nietzsche practically tells us here that it is not
he who intentionally wears eccentric clothes or does eccentric things
who is truly the individualist  the profound man  who is by nature
differentiated from his fellows  feels this difference too keenly to
call attention to it by any outward show  he is shamefast and bashful
with those who surround him and wishes not to be discovered by them 
just as one instinctively avoids all lavish display of comfort or wealth
in the presence of a poor friend 

chapter xliv  the stillest hour 

this seems to me to give an account of the great struggle which must
have taken place in nietzsche s soul before he finally resolved to make
known the more esoteric portions of his teaching  our deepest feelings
crave silence  there is a certain self respect in the serious man which
makes him hold his profoundest feelings sacred  before they are uttered
they are full of the modesty of a virgin  and often the oldest sage will
blush like a girl when this virginity is violated by an indiscretion
which forces him to reveal his deepest thoughts 

   

part iii 

this is perhaps the most important of all the four parts  if it
contained only  the vision and the enigma  and  the old and new tables 
 i should still be of this opinion  for in the former of these discourses
we meet with what nietzsche regarded as the crowning doctrine of his
philosophy and in  the old and new tables  we have a valuable epitome of
practically all his leading principles 

chapter xlvi  the vision and the enigma 

 the vision and the enigma  is perhaps an example of nietzsche in his
most obscure vein  we must know how persistently he inveighed against
the oppressing and depressing influence of man s sense of guilt and
consciousness of sin in order fully to grasp the significance of this
discourse  slowly but surely  he thought the values of christianity and
judaic traditions had done their work in the minds of men  what were
once but expedients devised for the discipline of a certain portion of
humanity  had now passed into man s blood and had become instincts  this
oppressive and paralysing sense of guilt and of sin is what nietzsche
refers to when he speaks of  the spirit of gravity   this creature
half dwarf  half mole  whom he bears with him a certain distance on his
climb and finally defies  and whom he calls his devil and arch enemy  is
nothing more than the heavy millstone  guilty conscience   together with
the concept of sin which at present hangs round the neck of men  to rise
above it  to soar  is the most difficult of all things to day  nietzsche
is able to think cheerfully and optimistically of the possibility of
life in this world recurring again and again  when he has once cast the
dwarf from his shoulders  and he announces his doctrine of the eternal
recurrence of all things great and small to his arch enemy and in
defiance of him 

that there is much to be said for nietzsche s hypothesis of the eternal
recurrence of all things great and small  nobody who has read the
literature on the subject will doubt for an instant  but it remains a
very daring conjecture notwithstanding and even in its ultimate effect 
as a dogma  on the minds of men  i venture to doubt whether nietzsche
ever properly estimated its worth  see note on chapter lvii   

what follows is clear enough  zarathustra sees a young shepherd
struggling on the ground with a snake holding fast to the back of his
throat  the sage  assuming that the snake must have crawled into the
young man s mouth while he lay sleeping  runs to his help and pulls
at the loathsome reptile with all his might  but in vain  at last  in
despair  zarathustra appeals to the young man s will  knowing full well
what a ghastly operation he is recommending  he nevertheless cries 
 bite  bite  its head off  bite   as the only possible solution of the
difficulty  the young shepherd bites  and far away he spits the
snake s head  whereupon he rises   no longer shepherd  no longer man  a
transfigured being  a light surrounded being  that laughed  never on
earth laughed a man as he laughed  

in this parable the young shepherd is obviously the man of to day  the
snake that chokes him represents the stultifying and paralysing social
values that threaten to shatter humanity  and the advice  bite  bite  
 is but nietzsche s exasperated cry to mankind to alter their values
before it is too late 

chapter xlvii  involuntary bliss 

this  like  the wanderer   is one of the many introspective passages
in the work  and is full of innuendos and hints as to the nietzschean
outlook on life 

chapter xlviii  before sunrise 

here we have a record of zarathustra s avowal of optimism  as also the
important statement concerning  chance  or  accident   verse 27   those
who are familiar with nietzsche s philosophy will not require to be told
what an important role his doctrine of chance plays in his teaching 
the giant chance has hitherto played with the puppet  man    this is
the fact he cannot contemplate with equanimity  man shall now exploit
chance  he says again and again  and make it fall on its knees before
him   see verse 33 in  on the olive mount   and verses 9 10 in  the
bedwarfing virtue   

chapter xlix  the bedwarfing virtue 

this requires scarcely any comment  it is a satire on modern man and
his belittling virtues  in verses 23 and 24 of the second part of the
discourse we are reminded of nietzsche s powerful indictment of the
great of to day  in the antichrist  aphorism 43     at present
nobody has any longer the courage for separate rights  for rights of
domination  for a feeling of reverence for himself and his equals   for
pathos of distance   our politics are morbid from this want of
courage   the aristocracy of character has been undermined most craftily
by the lie of the equality of souls  and if the belief in the  privilege
of the many   makes revolutions and will continue to make them  it is
christianity  let us not doubt it  it is christian valuations  which
translate every revolution merely into blood and crime    see also
 beyond good and evil   pages 120  121   nietzsche thought it was a
bad sign of the times that even rulers have lost the courage of
their positions  and that a man of frederick the great s power and
distinguished gifts should have been able to say   ich bin der erste
diener des staates   i am the first servant of the state   to this
utterance of the great sovereign  verse 24 undoubtedly refers 
 cowardice  and  mediocrity   are the names with which he labels modern
notions of virtue and moderation 

in part iii   we get the sentiments of the discourse  in the happy
isles   but perhaps in stronger terms  once again we find nietzsche
thoroughly at ease  if not cheerful  as an atheist  and speaking with
vertiginous daring of making chance go on its knees to him  in verse
20  zarathustra makes yet another attempt at defining his entirely
anti anarchical attitude  and unless such passages have been completely
overlooked or deliberately ignored hitherto by those who will persist in
laying anarchy at his door  it is impossible to understand how he ever
became associated with that foul political party 

the last verse introduces the expression   the great noontide   in the
poem to be found at the end of  beyond good and evil   we meet with
the expression again  and we shall find it occurring time and again in
nietzsche s works  it will be found fully elucidated in the fifth part
of  the twilight of the idols   but for those who cannot refer to
this book  it were well to point out that nietzsche called the present
period  our period  the noon of man s history  dawn is behind us  the
childhood of mankind is over  now we know  there is now no longer any
excuse for mistakes which will tend to botch and disfigure the type man 
 with respect to what is past   he says   i have  like all discerning
ones  great toleration  that is to say  generous self control   but my
feeling changes suddenly  and breaks out as soon as i enter the modern
period  our period  our age knows      see note on chapter lxx   

chapter li  on passing by 

here we find nietzsche confronted with his extreme opposite  with
him therefore for whom he is most frequently mistaken by the unwary 
 zarathustra s ape  he is called in the discourse  he is one of those
at whose hands nietzsche had to suffer most during his life time  and
at whose hands his philosophy has suffered most since his death  in this
respect it may seem a little trivial to speak of extremes meeting  but
it is wonderfully apt  many have adopted nietzsche s mannerisms and
word coinages  who had nothing in common with him beyond the ideas and
 business  they plagiarised  but the superficial observer and a large
portion of the public  not knowing of these things   not knowing perhaps
that there are iconoclasts who destroy out of love and are therefore
creators  and that there are others who destroy out of resentment and
revengefulness and who are therefore revolutionists and anarchists   are
prone to confound the two  to the detriment of the nobler type 

if we now read what the fool says to zarathustra  and note the tricks of
speech he has borrowed from him  if we carefully follow the attitude
he assumes  we shall understand why zarathustra finally interrupts him 
 stop this at once   zarathustra cries   long have thy speech and
thy species disgusted me   out of love alone shall my contempt and my
warning bird take wing  but not out of the swamp   it were well if
this discourse were taken to heart by all those who are too ready to
associate nietzsche with lesser and noiser men   with mountebanks and
mummers 

chapter lii  the apostates 

it is clear that this applies to all those breathless and hasty  tasters
of everything   who plunge too rashly into the sea of independent
thought and  heresy   and who  having miscalculated their strength  find
it impossible to keep their head above water   a little older  a little
colder   says nietzsche  they soon clamber back to the conventions of
the age they intended reforming  the french then say  le diable se fait
hermite   but these men  as a rule  have never been devils  neither
do they become angels  for  in order to be really good or evil  some
strength and deep breathing is required  those who are more interested
in supporting orthodoxy than in being over nice concerning the kind of
support they give it  often refer to these people as evidence in favour
of the true faith 

chapter liii  the return home 

this is an example of a class of writing which may be passed over too
lightly by those whom poetasters have made distrustful of poetry  from
first to last it is extremely valuable as an autobiographical note  the
inevitable superficiality of the rabble is contrasted with the peaceful
and profound depths of the anchorite  here we first get a direct hint
concerning nietzsche s fundamental passion  the main force behind all
his new values and scathing criticism of existing values  in verse 30
we are told that pity was his greatest danger  the broad altruism of the
law giver  thinking over vast eras of time  was continually being pitted
by nietzsche  in himself  against that transient and meaner sympathy for
the neighbour which he more perhaps than any of his contemporaries had
suffered from  but which he was certain involved enormous dangers not
only for himself but also to the next and subsequent generations  see
note b   where  pity  is mentioned among the degenerate virtues   later
in the book we shall see how his profound compassion leads him into
temptation  and how frantically he struggles against it  in verses 31
and 32  he tells us to what extent he had to modify himself in order
to be endured by his fellows whom he loved  see also verse 12 in  manly
prudence    nietzsche s great love for his fellows  which he confesses
in the prologue  and which is at the root of all his teaching  seems
rather to elude the discerning powers of the average philanthropist and
modern man  he cannot see the wood for the trees  a philanthropy that
sacrifices the minority of the present day for the majority constituting
posterity  completely evades his mental grasp  and nietzsche s
philosophy  because it declares christian values to be a danger to the
future of our kind  is therefore shelved as brutal  cold  and hard  see
note on chapter xxxvi    nietzsche tried to be all things to all men 
he was sufficiently fond of his fellows for that  in the return home he
describes how he ultimately returns to loneliness in order to recover
from the effects of his experiment 

chapter liv  the three evil things 

nietzsche is here completely in his element  three things hitherto
best cursed and most calumniated on earth  are brought forward to be
weighed  voluptuousness  thirst of power  and selfishness   the three
forces in humanity which christianity has done most to garble and
besmirch   nietzsche endeavours to reinstate in their former places of
honour  voluptuousness  or sensual pleasure  is a dangerous thing to
discuss nowadays  if we mention it with favour we may be regarded 
however unjustly  as the advocate of savages  satyrs  and pure
sensuality  if we condemn it  we either go over to the puritans or we
join those who are wont to come to table with no edge to their appetites
and who therefore grumble at all good fare  there can be no doubt that
the value of healthy innocent voluptuousness  like the value of health
itself  must have been greatly discounted by all those who  resenting
their inability to partake of this world s goods  cried like st paul 
 i would that all men were even as i myself   now nietzsche s philosophy
might be called an attempt at giving back to healthy and normal men
innocence and a clean conscience in their desires  not to applaud the
vulgar sensualists who respond to every stimulus and whose passions are
out of hand  not to tell the mean  selfish individual  whose selfishness
is a pollution  see aphorism 33   twilight of the idols    that he is
right  nor to assure the weak  the sick  and the crippled  that the
thirst of power  which they gratify by exploiting the happier and
healthier individuals  is justified   but to save the clean healthy man
from the values of those around him  who look at everything through the
mud that is in their own bodies   to give him  and him alone  a clean
conscience in his manhood and the desires of his manhood   do i counsel
you to slay your instincts  i counsel to innocence in your instincts  
 in verse 7 of the second paragraph  as in verse i of paragraph 19 in
 the old and new tables   nietzsche gives us a reason for his occasional
obscurity  see also verses 3 to 7 of  poets    as i have already pointed
out  his philosophy is quite esoteric  it can serve no purpose with the
ordinary  mediocre type of man  i  personally  can no longer have any
doubt that nietzsche s only object  in that part of his philosophy where
he bids his friends stand  beyond good and evil  with him  was to save
higher men  whose growth and scope might be limited by the too
strict observance of modern values from foundering on the rocks of a
 compromise  between their own genius and traditional conventions  the
only possible way in which the great man can achieve greatness is
by means of exceptional freedom  the freedom which assists him in
experiencing himself  verses 20 to 30 afford an excellent supplement to
nietzsche s description of the attitude of the noble type towards the
slaves in aphorism 260 of the work  beyond good and evil   see also note
b  

chapter lv  the spirit of gravity 

 see note on chapter xlvi   in part ii  of this discourse we meet with
a doctrine not touched upon hitherto  save indirectly   i refer to the
doctrine of self love  we should try to understand this perfectly before
proceeding  for it is precisely views of this sort which  after having
been cut out of the original context  are repeated far and wide as
internal evidence proving the general unsoundness of nietzsche s
philosophy  already in the last of the  thoughts out of season 
 nietzsche speaks as follows about modern men      these modern creatures
wish rather to be hunted down  wounded and torn to shreds  than to
live alone with themselves in solitary calm  alone with oneself   this
thought terrifies the modern soul  it is his one anxiety  his one
ghastly fear   english edition  page 141   in his feverish scurry to
find entertainment and diversion  whether in a novel  a newspaper  or a
play  the modern man condemns his own age utterly  for he shows that in
his heart of hearts he despises himself  one cannot change a condition
of this sort in a day  to become endurable to oneself an inner
transformation is necessary  too long have we lost ourselves in our
friends and entertainments to be able to find ourselves so soon at
another s bidding   and verily  it is no commandment for to day and
to morrow to learn to love oneself  rather is it of all arts the finest 
subtlest  last  and patientest  

in the last verse nietzsche challenges us to show that our way is
the right way  in his teaching he does not coerce us  nor does he
overpersuade  he simply says   i am a law only for mine own  i am not a
law for all  this  is now my way   where is yours  

chapter lvi  old and new tables  par  2 

nietzsche himself declares this to be the most decisive portion of
the whole of  thus spake zarathustra   it is a sort of epitome of his
leading doctrines  in verse 12 of the second paragraph  we learn how he
himself would fain have abandoned the poetical method of expression had
he not known only too well that the only chance a new doctrine has of
surviving  nowadays  depends upon its being given to the world in some
kind of art form  just as prophets  centuries ago  often had to have
recourse to the mask of madness in order to mitigate the hatred of those
who did not and could not see as they did  so  to day  the struggle for
existence among opinions and values is so great  that an art form
is practically the only garb in which a new philosophy can dare to
introduce itself to us 

pars  3 and 4 

many of the paragraphs will be found to be merely reminiscent of former
discourses  for instance  par  3 recalls  redemption   the last verse
of par  4 is important  freedom which  as i have pointed out before 
nietzsche considered a dangerous acquisition in inexperienced or
unworthy hands  here receives its death blow as a general desideratum 
in the first part we read under  the way of the creating one   that
freedom as an end in itself does not concern zarathustra at all  he says
there   free from what  what doth that matter to zarathustra  clearly 
however  shall thine eye answer me  free for what   and in  the
bedwarfing virtue    ah that ye understood my word   do ever what ye
will  but first be such as can will   

par  5 

here we have a description of the kind of altruism nietzsche exacted
from higher men  it is really a comment upon  the bestowing virtue   see
note on chapter xxii   

par  6 

this refers  of course  to the reception pioneers of nietzsche s stamp
meet with at the hands of their contemporaries 

par  8 

nietzsche teaches that nothing is stable   not even values   not
even the concepts good and evil  he likens life unto a stream  but
foot bridges and railings span the stream  and they seem to stand
firm  many will be reminded of good and evil when they look upon these
structures  for thus these same values stand over the stream of life 
and life flows on beneath them and leaves them standing  when  however 
winter comes and the stream gets frozen  many inquire   should not
everything  stand still  fundamentally everything standeth still   but
soon the spring cometh and with it the thaw wind  it breaks the ice  and
the ice breaks down the foot bridges and railings  whereupon everything
is swept away  this state of affairs  according to nietzsche  has now
been reached   oh  my brethren  is not everything at present in flux 
have not all railings and foot bridges fallen into the water  who would
still hold on to  good  and  evil   

par  9 

this is complementary to the first three verses of par  2 

par  10 

so far  this is perhaps the most important paragraph  it is a protest
against reading a moral order of things in life   life is something
essentially immoral   nietzsche tells us in the introduction to the
 birth of tragedy   even to call life  activity   or to define it
further as  the continuous adjustment of internal relations to external
relations   as spencer has it  nietzsche characterises as a  democratic
idiosyncracy   he says to define it in this way   is to mistake the
true nature and function of life  which is will to power   life is
essentially appropriation  injury  conquest of the strange and weak 
suppression  severity  obtrusion of its own forms  incorporation and
at least  putting it mildest  exploitation   adaptation is merely a
secondary activity  a mere re activity  see note on chapter lvii   

pars  11  12 

these deal with nietzsche s principle of the desirability of rearing a
select race  the biological and historical grounds for his insistence
upon this principle are  of course  manifold  gobineau in his great
work   l inegalite des races humaines   lays strong emphasis upon the
evils which arise from promiscuous and inter social marriages  he alone
would suffice to carry nietzsche s point against all those who are
opposed to the other conditions  to the conditions which would have
saved rome  which have maintained the strength of the jewish race  and
which are strictly maintained by every breeder of animals throughout the
world  darwin in his remarks relative to the degeneration of cultivated
types of animals through the action of promiscuous breeding  brings
gobineau support from the realm of biology 

the last two verses of par  12 were discussed in the notes on chapters
xxxvi  and liii 

par  13 

this  like the first part of  the soothsayer   is obviously a reference
to the schopenhauerian pessimism 

pars  14  15  16  17 

these are supplementary to the discourse  backworld s men  

par  18 

we must be careful to separate this paragraph  in sense  from the
previous four paragraphs  nietzsche is still dealing with pessimism
here  but it is the pessimism of the hero  the man most susceptible of
all to desperate views of life  owing to the obstacles that are arrayed
against him in a world where men of his kind are very rare and are
continually being sacrificed  it was to save this man that nietzsche
wrote  heroism foiled  thwarted  and wrecked  hoping and fighting until
the last  is at length overtaken by despair  and renounces all struggle
for sleep  this is not the natural or constitutional pessimism which
proceeds from an unhealthy body  the dyspeptic s lack of appetite  it
is rather the desperation of the netted lion that ultimately stops all
movement  because the more it moves the more involved it becomes 

par  20 

 all that increases power is good  all that springs from weakness is
bad  the weak and ill constituted shall perish  first principle of our
charity  and one shall also help them thereto   nietzsche partly divined
the kind of reception moral values of this stamp would meet with at
the hands of the effeminate manhood of europe  here we see that he had
anticipated the most likely form their criticism would take  see also
the last two verses of par  17  

par  21 

the first ten verses  here  are reminiscent of  war and warriors  and
of  the flies in the market place   verses 11 and 12  however  are
particularly important  there is a strong argument in favour of the
sharp differentiation of castes and of races  and even of sexes  see
note on chapter xviii   running all through nietzsche s writings 
but sharp differentiation also implies antagonism in some form or
other  hence nietzsche s fears for modern men  what modern men desire
above all  is peace and the cessation of pain  but neither great races
nor great castes have ever been built up in this way   who still wanteth
to rule   zarathustra asks in the  prologue    who still wanteth to
obey  both are too burdensome   this is rapidly becoming everybody s
attitude to day  the tame moral reading of the face of nature  together
with such democratic interpretations of life as those suggested by
herbert spencer  are signs of a physiological condition which is the
reverse of that bounding and irresponsible healthiness in which harder
and more tragic values rule 

par  24 

this should be read in conjunction with  child and marriage   in the
fifth verse we shall recognise our old friend  marriage on the ten years
system   which george meredith suggested some years ago  this  however 
must not be taken too literally  i do not think nietzsche s profoundest
views on marriage were ever intended to be given over to the public at
all  at least not for the present  they appear in the biography by his
sister  and although their wisdom is unquestionable  the nature of the
reforms he suggests render it impossible for them to become popular just
now 

pars  26  27 

see note on  the prologue  

par  28 

nietzsche was not an iconoclast from predilection  no bitterness or
empty hate dictated his vituperations against existing values and
against the dogmas of his parents and forefathers  he knew too well what
these things meant to the millions who profess them  to approach the
task of uprooting them with levity or even with haste  he saw what
modern anarchists and revolutionists do not see  namely  that man is in
danger of actual destruction when his customs and values are broken 
i need hardly point out  therefore  how deeply he was conscious of
the responsibility he threw upon our shoulders when he invited us to
reconsider our position  the lines in this paragraph are evidence enough
of his earnestness 

chapter lvii  the convalescent 

we meet with several puzzles here  zarathustra calls himself the
advocate of the circle  the eternal recurrence of all things   and he
calls this doctrine his abysmal thought  in the last verse of the
first paragraph  however  after hailing his deepest thought  he cries 
 disgust  disgust  disgust   we know nietzsche s ideal man was that
 world approving  exuberant  and vivacious creature  who has not only
learnt to compromise and arrange with that which was and is  but wishes
to have it again  as it was and is  for all eternity insatiably calling
out da capo  not only to himself  but to the whole piece and play   see
note on chapter xlii    but if one ask oneself what the conditions to
such an attitude are  one will realise immediately how utterly different
nietzsche was from his ideal  the man who insatiably cries da capo to
himself and to the whole of his mise en scene  must be in a position to
desire every incident in his life to be repeated  not once  but
again and again eternally  now  nietzsche s life had been too full of
disappointments  illness  unsuccessful struggles  and snubs  to allow of
his thinking of the eternal recurrence without loathing  hence probably
the words of the last verse 

in verses 15 and 16  we have nietzsche declaring himself an evolutionist
in the broadest sense  that is to say  that he believes in the
development hypothesis as the description of the process by which
species have originated  now  to understand his position correctly
we must show his relationship to the two greatest of modern
evolutionists  darwin and spencer  as a philosopher  however  nietzsche
does not stand or fall by his objections to the darwinian or spencerian
cosmogony  he never laid claim to a very profound knowledge of biology 
and his criticism is far more valuable as the attitude of a fresh mind
than as that of a specialist towards the question  moreover  in his
objections many difficulties are raised which are not settled by an
appeal to either of the men above mentioned  we have given nietzsche s
definition of life in the note on chapter lvi   par  10  still  there
remains a hope that darwin and nietzsche may some day become reconciled
by a new description of the processes by which varieties occur  the
appearance of varieties among animals and of  sporting plants  in
the vegetable kingdom  is still shrouded in mystery  and the question
whether this is not precisely the ground on which darwin and nietzsche
will meet  is an interesting one  the former says in his  origin of
species   concerning the causes of variability      there are two
factors  namely  the nature of the organism  and the nature of the
conditions  the former seems to be much the more important  the italics
are mine    for nearly similar variations sometimes arise under  as
far as we can judge  dissimilar conditions  and on the other hand 
dissimilar variations arise under conditions which appear to be
nearly uniform   nietzsche  recognising this same truth  would ascribe
practically all the importance to the  highest functionaries in the
organism  in which the life will appears as an active and formative
principle   and except in certain cases  where passive organisms alone
are concerned  would not give such a prominent place to the influence
of environment  adaptation  according to him  is merely a secondary
activity  a mere re activity  and he is therefore quite opposed to
spencer s definition   life is the continuous adjustment of internal
relations to external relations   again in the motive force behind
animal and plant life  nietzsche disagrees with darwin  he
transforms the  struggle for existence   the passive and involuntary
condition  into the  struggle for power   which is active and creative 
and much more in harmony with darwin s own view  given above  concerning
the importance of the organism itself  the change is one of such
far reaching importance that we cannot dispose of it in a breath  as a
mere play upon words   much is reckoned higher than life itself by the
living one   nietzsche says that to speak of the activity of life as a
 struggle for existence   is to state the case inadequately  he warns us
not to confound malthus with nature  there is something more than
this struggle between the organic beings on this earth  want  which is
supposed to bring this struggle about  is not so common as is supposed 
some other force must be operative  the will to power is this force 
 the instinct of self preservation is only one of the indirect and most
frequent results thereof   a certain lack of acumen in psychological
questions and the condition of affairs in england at the time darwin
wrote  may both  according to nietzsche  have induced the renowned
naturalist to describe the forces of nature as he did in his  origin of
species  

in verses 28  29  and 30 of the second portion of this discourse we meet
with a doctrine which  at first sight  seems to be merely  le manoir
a l envers   indeed one english critic has actually said of nietzsche 
that  thus spake zarathustra  is no more than a compendium of modern
views and maxims turned upside down  examining these heterodox
pronouncements a little more closely  however  we may possibly perceive
their truth  regarding good and evil as purely relative values  it
stands to reason that what may be bad or evil in a given man  relative
to a certain environment  may actually be good if not highly virtuous
in him relative to a certain other environment  if this hypothetical man
represent the ascending line of life  that is to say  if he promise all
that which is highest in a graeco roman sense  then it is likely that
he will be condemned as wicked if introduced into the society of men
representing the opposite and descending line of life 

by depriving a man of his wickedness  more particularly nowadays  
therefore  one may unwittingly be doing violence to the greatest in him 
it may be an outrage against his wholeness  just as the lopping off of a
leg would be  fortunately  the natural so called  wickedness  of higher
men has in a certain measure been able to resist this lopping process
which successive slave moralities have practised  but signs are not
wanting which show that the noblest wickedness is fast vanishing from
society  the wickedness of courage and determination  and that nietzsche
had good reasons for crying   ah  that  man s  baddest is so very small 
ah  that his best is so very small  what is good  to be brave is good 
it is the good war which halloweth every cause    see also par  5 
 higher man   

chapter lx  the seven seals 

this is a final paean which zarathustra sings to eternity and the
marriage ring of rings  the ring of the eternal recurrence 

   

part iv 

in my opinion this part is nietzsche s open avowal that all his
philosophy  together with all his hopes  enthusiastic outbursts 
blasphemies  prolixities  and obscurities  were merely so many gifts
laid at the feet of higher men  he had no desire to save the world  what
he wished to determine was  who is to be master of the world  this is
a very different thing  he came to save higher men   to give them that
freedom by which  alone  they can develop and reach their zenith  see
note on chapter liv   end   it has been argued  and with considerable
force  that no such philosophy is required by higher men  that  as a
matter of fact  higher men  by virtue of their constitutions always  do
stand beyond good and evil  and never allow anything to stand in the
way of their complete growth  nietzsche  however  was evidently not so
confident about this  he would probably have argued that we only see the
successful cases  being a great man himself  he was well aware of the
dangers threatening greatness in our age  in  beyond good and evil  he
writes   there are few pains so grievous as to have seen  divined 
or experienced how an exceptional man has missed his way and
deteriorated     he knew  from his painfullest recollections on what
wretched obstacles promising developments of the highest rank have
hitherto usually gone to pieces  broken down  sunk  and become
contemptible   now in part iv  we shall find that his strongest
temptation to descend to the feeling of  pity  for his contemporaries 
is the  cry for help  which he hears from the lips of the higher men
exposed to the dreadful danger of their modern environment 

chapter lxi  the honey sacrifice 

in the fourteenth verse of this discourse nietzsche defines the solemn
duty he imposed upon himself   become what thou art   surely the
criticism which has been directed against this maxim must all fall to
the ground when it is remembered  once and for all  that nietzsche s
teaching was never intended to be other than an esoteric one   i am a
law only for mine own   he says emphatically   i am not a law for
all   it is of the greatest importance to humanity that its highest
individuals should be allowed to attain to their full development  for 
only by means of its heroes can the human race be led forward step by
step to higher and yet higher levels   become what thou art  applied
to all  of course  becomes a vicious maxim  it is to be hoped  however 
that we may learn in time that the same action performed by a given
number of men  loses its identity precisely that same number of
times    quod licet jovi  non licet bovi  

at the last eight verses many readers may be tempted to laugh  in
england we almost always laugh when a man takes himself seriously at
anything save sport  and there is of course no reason why the reader
should not be hilarious   a certain greatness is requisite  both in
order to be sublime and to have reverence for the sublime  nietzsche
earnestly believed that the zarathustra kingdom  his dynasty of a
thousand years  would one day come  if he had not believed it so
earnestly  if every artist in fact had not believed so earnestly in
his hazar  whether of ten  fifteen  a hundred  or a thousand years  we
should have lost all our higher men  they would have become pessimists 
suicides  or merchants  if the minor poet and philosopher has made us
shy of the prophetic seriousness which characterized an isaiah or a
jeremiah  it is surely our loss and the minor poet s gain 

chapter lxii  the cry of distress 

we now meet with zarathustra in extraordinary circumstances  he is
confronted with schopenhauer and tempted by the old soothsayer to commit
the sin of pity   i have come that i may seduce thee to thy last sin  
 says the soothsayer to zarathustra  it will be remembered that in
schopenhauer s ethics  pity is elevated to the highest place among the
virtues  and very consistently too  seeing that the weltanschauung is
a pessimistic one  schopenhauer appeals to nietzsche s deepest and
strongest sentiment  his sympathy for higher men   why dost thou conceal
thyself   he cries   it is the higher man that calleth for thee  
 zarathustra is almost overcome by the soothsayer s pleading  as he
had been once already in the past  but he resists him step by step  at
length he can withstand him no longer  and  on the plea that the higher
man is on his ground and therefore under his protection  zarathustra
departs in search of him  leaving schopenhauer  a higher man in
nietzsche s opinion  in the cave as a guest 

chapter lxiii  talk with the kings 

on his way zarathustra meets two more higher men of his time  two
kings cross his path  they are above the average modern type  for their
instincts tell them what real ruling is  and they despise the mockery
which they have been taught to call  reigning    we are not the first
men   they say   and have nevertheless to stand for them  of this
imposture have we at last become weary and disgusted   it is the kings
who tell zarathustra   there is no sorer misfortune in all human destiny
than when the mighty of the earth are not also the first men  there
everything becometh false and distorted and monstrous   the kings are
also asked by zarathustra to accept the shelter of his cave  whereupon
he proceeds on his way 

chapter lxiv  the leech 

among the higher men whom zarathustra wishes to save  is also the
scientific specialist  the man who honestly and scrupulously pursues his
investigations  as darwin did  in one department of knowledge   i love
him who liveth in order to know  and seeketh to know in order that the
superman may hereafter live  thus seeketh he his own down going  
  the spiritually conscientious one   he is called in this discourse 
zarathustra steps on him unawares  and the slave of science  bleeding
from the violence he has done to himself by his self imposed task 
speaks proudly of his little sphere of knowledge  his little hand s
breadth of ground on zarathustra s territory  philosophy   where mine
honesty ceaseth   says the true scientific specialist   there am i blind
and want also to be blind  where i want to know  however  there want
i also to be honest  namely  severe  rigorous  restricted  cruel  and
inexorable   zarathustra greatly respecting this man  invites him too to
the cave  and then vanishes in answer to another cry for help 

chapter lxv  the magician 

the magician is of course an artist  and nietzsche s intimate knowledge
of perhaps the greatest artist of his age rendered the selection of
wagner  as the type in this discourse  almost inevitable  most readers
will be acquainted with the facts relating to nietzsche s and wagner s
friendship and ultimate separation  as a boy and a youth nietzsche had
shown such a remarkable gift for music that it had been a question at
one time whether he should not perhaps give up everything else in order
to develop this gift  but he became a scholar notwithstanding  although
he never entirely gave up composing  and playing the piano  while
still in his teens  he became acquainted with wagner s music and
grew passionately fond of it  long before he met wagner he must have
idealised him in his mind to an extent which only a profoundly artistic
nature could have been capable of  nietzsche always had high ideals for
humanity  if one were asked whether  throughout his many changes  there
was yet one aim  one direction  and one hope to which he held fast 
one would be forced to reply in the affirmative and declare that aim 
direction  and hope to have been  the elevation of the type man  
 now  when nietzsche met wagner he was actually casting about for an
incarnation of his dreams for the german people  and we have only to
remember his youth  he was twenty one when he was introduced to wagner  
his love of wagner s music  and the undoubted power of the great
musician s personality  in order to realise how very uncritical his
attitude must have been in the first flood of his enthusiasm  again 
when the friendship ripened  we cannot well imagine nietzsche  the
younger man  being anything less than intoxicated by his senior s
attention and love  and we are therefore not surprised to find him
pressing wagner forward as the great reformer and saviour of mankind 
 wagner in bayreuth   english edition  1909  gives us the best proof
of nietzsche s infatuation  and although signs are not wanting in this
essay which show how clearly and even cruelly he was sub consciously
 taking stock  of his friend  even then  the work is a record of what
great love and admiration can do in the way of endowing the object
of one s affection with all the qualities and ideals that a fertile
imagination can conceive 

when the blow came it was therefore all the more severe  nietzsche
at length realised that the friend of his fancy and the real richard
wagner  the composer of parsifal  were not one  the fact dawned
upon him slowly  disappointment upon disappointment  revelation after
revelation  ultimately brought it home to him  and though his best
instincts were naturally opposed to it at first  the revulsion of
feeling at last became too strong to be ignored  and nietzsche was
plunged into the blackest despair  years after his break with wagner 
he wrote  the case of wagner   and  nietzsche contra wagner   and these
works are with us to prove the sincerity and depth of his views on the
man who was the greatest event of his life 

the poem in this discourse is  of course  reminiscent of wagner s own
poetical manner  and it must be remembered that the whole was written
subsequent to nietzsche s final break with his friend  the dialogue
between zarathustra and the magician reveals pretty fully what it
was that nietzsche grew to loathe so intensely in wagner   viz   his
pronounced histrionic tendencies  his dissembling powers  his inordinate
vanity  his equivocalness  his falseness   it honoureth thee   says
zarathustra   that thou soughtest for greatness  but it betrayeth thee
also  thou art not great   the magician is nevertheless sent as a guest
to zarathustra s cave  for  in his heart  zarathustra believed until the
end that the magician was a higher man broken by modern values 

chapter lxvi  out of service 

zarathustra now meets the last pope  and  in a poetical form  we get
nietzsche s description of the course judaism and christianity pursued
before they reached their final break up in atheism  agnosticism  and
the like  the god of a strong  warlike race  the god of israel  is a
jealous  revengeful god  he is a power that can be pictured and endured
only by a hardy and courageous race  a race rich enough to sacrifice and
to lose in sacrifice  the image of this god degenerates with the people
that appropriate it  and gradually he becomes a god of love   soft and
mellow   a lower middle class deity  who is  pitiful   he can no longer
be a god who requires sacrifice  for we ourselves are no longer rich
enough for that  the tables are therefore turned upon him  he must
sacrifice to us  his pity becomes so great that he actually does
sacrifice something to us  his only begotten son  such a process
carried to its logical conclusions must ultimately end in his own
destruction  and thus we find the pope declaring that god was one day
suffocated by his all too great pity  what follows is clear enough 
zarathustra recognises another higher man in the ex pope and sends him
too as a guest to the cave 

chapter lxvii  the ugliest man 

this discourse contains perhaps the boldest of nietzsche s suggestions
concerning atheism  as well as some extremely penetrating remarks upon
the sentiment of pity  zarathustra comes across the repulsive creature
sitting on the wayside  and what does he do  he manifests the only
correct feelings that can be manifested in the presence of any great
misery  that is to say  shame  reverence  embarrassment  nietzsche
detested the obtrusive and gushing pity that goes up to misery without
a blush either on its cheek or in its heart  the pity which is only
another form of self glorification   thank god that i am not like
thee    only this self glorifying sentiment can lend a well constituted
man the impudence to show his pity for the cripple and the
ill constituted  in the presence of the ugliest man nietzsche
blushes   he blushes for his race  his own particular kind of
altruism  the altruism that might have prevented the existence of this
man  strikes him with all its force  he will have the world otherwise 
he will have a world where one need not blush for one s fellows  hence
his appeal to us to love only our children s land  the land undiscovered
in the remotest sea 

zarathustra calls the ugliest man the murderer of god  certainly  this
is one aspect of a certain kind of atheism  the atheism of the man who
reveres beauty to such an extent that his own ugliness  which outrages
him  must be concealed from every eye lest it should not be respected as
zarathustra respected it  if there be a god  he too must be evaded  his
pity must be foiled  but god is ubiquitous and omniscient  therefore 
for the really great ugly man  he must not exist   their pity is it from
which i flee away   he says  that is to say   it is from their want of
reverence and lack of shame in presence of my great misery   the ugliest
man despises himself  but zarathustra said in his prologue   i love
the great despisers because they are the great adorers  and arrows of
longing for the other shore   he therefore honours the ugliest man  sees
height in his self contempt  and invites him to join the other higher
men in the cave 

chapter lxviii  the voluntary beggar 

in this discourse  we undoubtedly have the ideal buddhist  if not
gautama buddha himself  nietzsche had the greatest respect for buddhism 
and almost wherever he refers to it in his works  it is in terms of
praise  he recognised that though buddhism is undoubtedly a religion for
decadents  its decadent values emanate from the higher and not  as in
christianity  from the lower grades of society  in aphorism 20 of  the
antichrist   he compares it exhaustively with christianity  and
the result of his investigation is very much in favour of the older
religion  still  he recognised a most decided buddhistic influence
in christ s teaching  and the words in verses 29  30  and 31 are very
reminiscent of his views in regard to the christian savior 

the figure of christ has been introduced often enough into fiction  and
many scholars have undertaken to write his life according to their own
lights  but few perhaps have ever attempted to present him to us bereft
of all those characteristics which a lack of the sense of harmony has
attached to his person through the ages in which his doctrines have been
taught  now nietzsche disagreed entirely with renan s view  that christ
was  le grand maitre en ironie   in aphorism 31 of  the antichrist  
he says that he  nietzsche  always purged his picture of the humble
nazarene of all those bitter and spiteful outbursts which  in view of
the struggle the first christians went through  may very well have been
added to the original character by apologists and sectarians who  at
that time  could ill afford to consider nice psychological points 
seeing that what they needed  above all  was a wrangling and abusive
deity  these two conflicting halves in the character of the christ of
the gospels  which no sound psychology can ever reconcile  nietzsche
always kept distinct in his own mind  he could not credit the same man
with sentiments sometimes so noble and at other times so vulgar  and
in presenting us with this new portrait of the saviour  purged of all
impurities  nietzsche rendered military honours to a foe  which far
exceed in worth all that his most ardent disciples have ever claimed for
him  in verse 26 we are vividly reminded of herbert spencer s words   le
mariage de convenance  is legalised prostitution  

chapter lxix  the shadow 

here we have a description of that courageous and wayward spirit that
literally haunts the footsteps of every great thinker and every great
leader  sometimes with the result that it loses all aims  all hopes 
and all trust in a definite goal  it is the case of the bravest and
most broad minded men of to day  these literally shadow the most daring
movements in the science and art of their generation  they completely
lose their bearings and actually find themselves  in the end  without a
way  a goal  or a home   on every surface have i already sat    i become
thin  i am almost equal to a shadow   at last  in despair  such men
do indeed cry out   nothing is true  all is permitted   and then they
become mere wreckage   too much hath become clear unto me  now nothing
mattereth to me any more  nothing liveth any longer that i love   how
should i still love myself  have i still a goal  where is my home  
 zarathustra realises the danger threatening such a man   thy danger is
not small  thou free spirit and wanderer   he says   thou hast had a bad
day  see that a still worse evening doth not overtake thee   the danger
zarathustra refers to is precisely this  that even a prison may seem a
blessing to such a man  at least the bars keep him in a place of rest 
a place of confinement  at its worst  is real   beware lest in the end
a narrow faith capture thee   says zarathustra   for now everything that
is narrow and fixed seduceth and tempteth thee  

chapter lxx  noontide 

at the noon of life nietzsche said he entered the world  with him
man came of age  we are now held responsible for our actions  our old
guardians  the gods and demi gods of our youth  the superstitions and
fears of our childhood  withdraw  the field lies open before us  we
lived through our morning with but one master  chance    let us see to
it that we make our afternoon our own  see note xlix   part iii   

chapter lxxi  the greeting 

here i think i may claim that my contention in regard to the purpose and
aim of the whole of nietzsche s philosophy  as stated at the beginning
of my notes on part iv   is completely upheld  he fought for  all who
do not want to live  unless they learn again to hope  unless they learn
 from him  the great hope   zarathustra s address to his guests shows
clearly enough how he wished to help them   i do not treat my warriors
indulgently   he says   how then could ye be fit for my warfare   he
rebukes and spurns them  no word of love comes from his lips  elsewhere
he says a man should be a hard bed to his friend  thus alone can he be
of use to him  nietzsche would be a hard bed to higher men  he would
make them harder  for  in order to be a law unto himself  man must
possess the requisite hardness   i wait for higher ones  stronger ones 
more triumphant ones  merrier ones  for such as are built squarely in
body and soul   he says in par  6 of  higher man    

 ye higher men  think ye that i am here to put right what ye have put
wrong  or that i wished henceforth to make snugger couches for you
sufferers  or show you restless  miswandering  misclimbing ones new and
easier footpaths  

 nay  nay  three times nay  always more  always better ones of your type
shall succumb  for ye shall always have it worse and harder  

chapter lxxii  the supper 

in the first seven verses of this discourse  i cannot help seeing
a gentle allusion to schopenhauer s habits as a bon vivant  for a
pessimist  be it remembered  schopenhauer led quite an extraordinary
life  he ate well  loved well  played the flute well  and i believe he
smoked the best cigars  what follows is clear enough 

chapter lxxiii  the higher man  par  1 

nietzsche admits  here  that at one time he had thought of appealing to
the people  to the crowd in the market place  but that he had ultimately
to abandon the task  he bids higher men depart from the market place 

par  3 

here we are told quite plainly what class of men actually owe all their
impulses and desires to the instinct of self preservation  the struggle
for existence is indeed the only spur in the case of such people 
to them it matters not in what shape or condition man be preserved 
provided only he survive  the transcendental maxim that  life per se is
precious  is the ruling maxim here 

par  4 

in the note on chapter lvii   end  i speak of nietzsche s elevation of
the virtue  courage  to the highest place among the virtues  here he
tells higher men the class of courage he expects from them 

pars  5  6 

these have already been referred to in the notes on chapters lvii   end 
and lxxi 

par  7 

i suggest that the last verse in this paragraph strongly confirms the
view that nietzsche s teaching was always meant by him to be esoteric
and for higher man alone 

par  9 

in the last verse  here  another shaft of light is thrown upon the
immaculate perception or so called  pure objectivity  of the scientific
mind   freedom from fever is still far from being knowledge   where a
man s emotions cease to accompany him in his investigations  he is
not necessarily nearer the truth  says spencer  in the preface to his
autobiography    in the genesis of a system of thought  the emotional
nature is a large factor  perhaps as large a factor as the intellectual
nature   see pages 134  141 of vol  i    thoughts out of season   

pars  10  11 

when we approach nietzsche s philosophy we must be prepared to be
independent thinkers  in fact  the greatest virtue of his works is
perhaps the subtlety with which they impose the obligation upon one
of thinking alone  of scoring off one s own bat  and of shifting
intellectually for oneself 

par  13 

 i am a railing alongside the torrent  whoever is able to grasp me  may
grasp me  your crutch  however  i am not   these two paragraphs are an
exhortation to higher men to become independent 

par  15 

here nietzsche perhaps exaggerates the importance of heredity  as 
however  the question is by no means one on which we are all agreed 
what he says is not without value 

a very important principle in nietzsche s philosophy is enunciated in
the first verse of this paragraph   the higher its type  always the
seldomer doth a thing succeed   see page 82 of  beyond good and evil   
those who  like some political economists  talk in a business like way
about the terrific waste of human life and energy  deliberately overlook
the fact that the waste most to be deplored usually occurs among
higher individuals  economy was never precisely one of nature s leading
principles  all this sentimental wailing over the larger proportion
of failures than successes in human life  does not seem to take into
account the fact that it is the rarest thing on earth for a highly
organised being to attain to the fullest development and activity of all
its functions  simply because it is so highly organised  the blind will
to power in nature therefore stands in urgent need of direction by man 

pars  16  17  18  19  20 

these paragraphs deal with nietzsche s protest against the democratic
seriousness  pobelernst  of modern times   all good things laugh   he
says  and his final command to the higher men is   learn  i pray you  to
laugh   all that is good  in nietzsche s sense  is cheerful  to be able
to crack a joke about one s deepest feelings is the greatest test of
their value  the man who does not laugh  like the man who does not make
faces  is already a buffoon at heart 

 what hath hitherto been the greatest sin here on earth  was it not the
word of him who said   woe unto them that laugh now   did he himself
find no cause for laughter on the earth  then he sought badly  a child
even findeth cause for it  

chapter lxxiv  the song of melancholy 

after his address to the higher men  zarathustra goes out into the
open to recover himself  meanwhile the magician  wagner   seizing the
opportunity in order to draw them all into his net once more  sings the
song of melancholy 

chapter lxxv  science 

the only one to resist the  melancholy voluptuousness  of his art  is
the spiritually conscientious one  the scientific specialist of whom we
read in the discourse entitled  the leech   he takes the harp from the
magician and cries for air  while reproving the musician in the style
of  the case of wagner   when the magician retaliates by saying that the
spiritually conscientious one could have understood little of his song 
the latter replies   thou praisest me in that thou separatest me from
thyself   the speech of the scientific man to his fellow higher men is
well worth studying  by means of it  nietzsche pays a high tribute to
the honesty of the true specialist  while  in representing him as the
only one who can resist the demoniacal influence of the magician s
music  he elevates him at a stroke  above all those present  zarathustra
and the spiritually conscientious one join issue at the end on the
question of the proper place of  fear  in man s history  and nietzsche
avails himself of the opportunity in order to restate his views
concerning the relation of courage to humanity  it is precisely because
courage has played the most important part in our development that
he would not see it vanish from among our virtues to day      courage
seemeth to me the entire primitive history of man  

chapter lxxvi  among the daughters of the desert 

this tells its own tale 

chapter lxxvii  the awakening 

in this discourse  nietzsche wishes to give his followers a warning 
he thinks he has so far helped them that they have become convalescent 
that new desires are awakened in them and that new hopes are in their
arms and legs  but he mistakes the nature of the change  true  he has
helped them  he has given them back what they most need  i e   belief in
believing  the confidence in having confidence in something  but how
do they use it  this belief in faith  if one can so express it without
seeming tautological  has certainly been restored to them  and in
the first flood of their enthusiasm they use it by bowing down and
worshipping an ass  when writing this passage  nietzsche was obviously
thinking of the accusations which were levelled at the early christians
by their pagan contemporaries  it is well known that they were supposed
not only to be eaters of human flesh but also ass worshippers  and among
the roman graffiti  the most famous is the one found on the palatino 
showing a man worshipping a cross on which is suspended a figure
with the head of an ass  see minucius felix   octavius  ix   tacitus 
 historiae  v  3  tertullian   apologia   etc    nietzsche s obvious
moral  however  is that great scientists and thinkers  once they have
reached the wall encircling scepticism and have thereby learned to
recover their confidence in the act of believing  as such  usually
manifest the change in their outlook by falling victims to the narrowest
and most superstitious of creeds  so much for the introduction of the
ass as an object of worship 

now  with regard to the actual service and ass festival  no reader who
happens to be acquainted with the religious history of the middle ages
will fail to see the allusion here to the asinaria festa which were by
no means uncommon in france  germany  and elsewhere in europe during the
thirteenth  fourteenth  and fifteenth centuries 

chapter lxxviii  the ass festival 

at length  in the middle of their feast  zarathustra bursts in upon
them and rebukes them soundly  but he does not do so long  in the
ass festival  it suddenly occurs to him  that he is concerned with a
ceremony that may not be without its purpose  as something foolish but
necessary  a recreation for wise men  he is therefore highly pleased
that the higher men have all blossomed forth  they therefore require
new festivals    a little valiant nonsense  some divine service and
ass festival  some old joyful zarathustra fool  some blusterer to blow
their souls bright  

he tells them not to forget that night and the ass festival  for  such
things only the convalescent devise  and should ye celebrate it again  
 he concludes   do it from love to yourselves  do it also from love to
me  and in remembrance of me  

chapter lxxix  the drunken song 

it were the height of presumption to attempt to fix any particular
interpretation of my own to the words of this song  with what has gone
before  the reader  while reading it as poetry  should be able to seek
and find his own meaning in it  the doctrine of the eternal recurrence
appears for the last time here  in an art form  nietzsche lays stress
upon the fact that all happiness  all delight  longs for repetitions 
and just as a child cries  again  again   to the adult who happens to
be amusing him  so the man who sees a meaning  and a joyful meaning  in
existence must also cry  again   and yet  again   to all his life 

chapter lxxx  the sign 

in this discourse  nietzsche disassociates himself finally from the
higher men  and by the symbol of the lion  wishes to convey to us that
he has won over and mastered the best and the most terrible in nature 
that great power and tenderness are kin  was already his belief in
1875  eight years before he wrote this speech  and when the birds and
the lion come to him  it is because he is the embodiment of the two
qualities  all that is terrible and great in nature  the higher men are
not yet prepared for  for they retreat horror stricken into the cave
when the lion springs at them  but zarathustra makes not a move towards
them  he was tempted to them on the previous day  he says  but  that
hath had its time  my suffering and my fellow suffering   what matter
about them  do i then strive after happiness  i strive after my work 
well  the lion hath come  my children are nigh  zarathustra hath grown
ripe  my day beginneth  arise now  arise  thou great noonday  

   

the above i know to be open to much criticism  i shall be grateful to
all those who will be kind enough to show me where and how i have gone
wrong  but i should like to point out that  as they stand  i have not
given to these notes by any means their final form
