p  j  proudhon  his life and his works 

the correspondence  1  of p  j  proudhon  the first volumes of which we
publish to day  has been collected since his death by the faithful
and intelligent labors of his daughter  aided by a few friends  it was
incomplete when submitted to sainte beuve  but the portion with which
the illustrious academician became acquainted was sufficient to allow
him to estimate it as a whole with that soundness of judgment which
characterized him as a literary critic 

he would  however  caution readers against accepting the biographer s
interpretation of the author s views as in any sense authoritative 
advising them  rather  to await the publication of the remainder
of proudhon s writings  that they may form an opinion for
themselves  translator 


in an important work  which his habitual readers certainly have not
forgotten  although death did not allow him to finish it  sainte beuve
thus judges the correspondence of the great publicist   

 the letters of proudhon  even outside the circle of his particular
friends  will always be of value  we can always learn something from
them  and here is the proper place to determine the general character of
his correspondence 

 it has always been large  especially since he became so celebrated 
and  to tell the truth  i am persuaded that  in the future  the
correspondence of proudhon will be his principal  vital work  and that
most of his books will be only accessory to and corroborative of this 
at any rate  his books can be well understood only by the aid of his
letters and the continual explanations which he makes to those who
consult him in their doubt  and request him to define more clearly his
position 

 there are  among celebrated people  many methods of correspondence 
there are those to whom letter writing is a bore  and who  assailed with
questions and compliments  reply in the greatest haste  solely that the
job may be over with  and who return politeness for politeness  mingling
it with more or less wit  this kind of correspondence  though coming
from celebrated people  is insignificant and unworthy of collection and
classification 

 after those who write letters in performance of a disagreeable duty 
and almost side by side with them in point of insignificance  i should
put those who write in a manner wholly external  wholly superficial 
devoted only to flattery  lavishing praise like gold  without counting
it  and those also who weigh every word  who reply formally and
pompously  with a view to fine phrases and effects  they exchange words
only  and choose them solely for their brilliancy and show  you think
it is you  individually  to whom they speak  but they are addressing
themselves in your person to the four corners of europe  such letters
are empty  and teach as nothing but theatrical execution and the
favorite pose of their writers 

 i will not class among the latter the more prudent and sagacious
authors who  when writing to individuals  keep one eye on posterity 
we know that many who pursue this method have written long  finished 
charming  flattering  and tolerably natural letters  beranger furnishes
us with the best example of this class 

proudhon  however  is a man of entirely different nature and habits 
in writing  he thinks of nothing but his idea and the person whom he
addresses  ad rem et ad hominem  a man of conviction and doctrine  to
write does not weary him  to be questioned does not annoy him  when
approached  he cares only to know that your motive is not one of futile
curiosity  but the love of truth  he assumes you to be serious  he
replies  he examines your objections  sometimes verbally  sometimes
in writing  for  as he remarks  if there be some points which
correspondence can never settle  but which can be made clear by
conversation in two minutes  at other times just the opposite is the
case  an objection clearly stated in writing  a doubt well expressed 
which elicits a direct and positive reply  helps things along more than
ten hours of oral intercourse   in writing to you he does not hesitate
to treat the subject anew  he unfolds to you the foundation and
superstructure of his thought  rarely does he confess himself
defeated  it is not his way  he holds to his position  but admits the
breaks  the variations  in short  the evolution of his mind  the history
of his mind is in his letters  there it must be sought 

 proudhon  whoever addresses him  is always ready  he quits the page
of the book on which he is at work to answer you with the same pen  and
that without losing patience  without getting confused  without
sparing or complaining of his ink  he is a public man  devoted to the
propagation of his idea by all methods  and the best method  with him 
is always the present one  the latest one  his very handwriting  bold 
uniform  legible  even in the most tiresome passages  betrays no haste 
no hurry to finish  each line is accurate  nothing is left to chance 
the punctuation  very correct and a little emphatic and decided 
indicates with precision and delicate distinction all the links in the
chain of his argument  he is devoted entirely to you  to his business
and yours  while writing to you  and never to anything else  all the
letters of his which i have seen are serious  not one is commonplace 

 but at the same time he is not at all artistic or affected  he does
not construct his letters  he does not revise them  he spends no time in
reading them over  we have a first draught  excellent and clear  a jet
from the fountain head  but that is all  the new arguments  which he
discovers in support of his ideas and which opposition suggests to
him  are an agreeable surprise  and shed a light which we should vainly
search for even in his works  his correspondence differs essentially
from his books  in that it gives you no uneasiness  it places you in
the very heart of the man  explains him to you  and leaves you with an
impression of moral esteem and almost of intellectual security  we feel
his sincerity  i know of no one to whom he can be more fitly compared in
this respect than george sand  whose correspondence is large  and at the
same time full of sincerity  his role and his nature correspond  if
he is writing to a young man who unbosoms himself to him in sceptical
anxiety  to a young woman who asks him to decide delicate questions of
conduct for her  his letter takes the form of a short moral essay  of a
father confessor s advice  has he perchance attended the theatre  a
rare thing for him  to witness one of ponsart s comedies  or a drama of
charles edmond s  he feels bound to give an account of his impressions
to the friend to whom he is indebted for this pleasure  and his letter
becomes a literary and philosophical criticism  full of sense  and like
no other  his familiarity is suited to his correspondent  he affects no
rudeness  the terms of civility or affection which he employs towards
his correspondents are sober  measured  appropriate to each  and honest
in their simplicity and cordiality  when he speaks of morals and the
family  he seems at times like the patriarchs of the bible  his command
of language is complete  and he never fails to avail himself of it  now
and then a coarse word  a few personalities  too bitter and quite unjust
or injurious  will have to be suppressed in printing  time  however  as
it passes away  permits many things and renders them inoffensive  am i
right in saying that proudhon s correspondence  always substantial  will
one day be the most accessible and attractive portion of his works  


almost the whole of proudhon s real biography is included in his
correspondence  up to 1837  the date of the first letter which we have
been able to collect  his life  narrated by sainte beuve  from whom we
make numerous extracts  may be summed up in a few pages 

pierre joseph proudhon was born on the 15th of january  1809  in
a suburb of besancon  called mouillere  his father and mother were
employed in the great brewery belonging to m  renaud  his father  though
a cousin of the jurist proudhon  the celebrated professor in the faculty
of dijon  was a journeyman brewer  his mother  a genuine peasant  was a
common servant  she was an orderly person of great good sense  and  as
they who knew her say  a superior woman of heroic character   to use the
expression of the venerable m  weiss  the librarian at besancon  she
it was especially that proudhon resembled  she and his grandfather
tournesi  the soldier peasant of whom his mother told him  and whose
courageous deeds he has described in his work on  justice   proudhon 
who always felt a great veneration for his mother catharine  gave
her name to the elder of his daughters  in 1814  when besancon was
blockaded  mouillere  which stood in front of the walls of the town  was
destroyed in the defence of the place  and proudhon s father established
a cooper s shop in a suburb of battant  called vignerons  very honest 
but simple minded and short sighted  this cooper  the father of five
children  of whom pierre joseph was the eldest  passed his life in
poverty  at eight years of age  proudhon either made himself useful in
the house  or tended the cattle out of doors  no one should fail to read
that beautiful and precious page of his work on  justice   in which he
describes the rural sports which he enjoyed when a neatherd  at the age
of twelve  he was a cellar boy in an inn  this  however  did not prevent
him from studying 

his mother was greatly aided by m  renaud  the former owner of the
brewery  who had at that time retired from business  and was engaged in
the education of his children 

proudhon entered school as a day scholar in the sixth class  he was
necessarily irregular in his attendance  domestic cares and restraints
sometimes kept him from his classes  he succeeded nevertheless in his
studies  he showed great perseverance  his family were so poor that they
could not afford to furnish him with books  he was obliged to borrow
them from his comrades  and copy the text of his lessons  he has himself
told us that he was obliged to leave his wooden shoes outside the door 
that he might not disturb the classes with his noise  and that  having
no hat  he went to school bareheaded  one day  towards the close of his
studies  on returning from the distribution of the prizes  loaded with
crowns  he found nothing to eat in the house 


 in his eagerness for labor and his thirst for knowledge  proudhon  
says sainte beuve   was not content with the instruction of his
teachers  from his twelfth to his fourteenth year  he was a constant
frequenter of the town library  one curiosity led to another  and he
called for book after book  sometimes eight or ten at one sitting  the
learned librarian  the friend and almost the brother of charles nodier 
m  weiss  approached him one day  and said  smiling   but  my little
friend  what do you wish to do with all these books   the child raised
his head  eyed his questioner  and replied   what s that to you   and
the good m  weiss remembers it to this day  


forced to earn his living  proudhon could not continue his studies  he
entered a printing office in besancon as a proof reader  becoming 
soon after  a compositor  he made a tour of france in this capacity  at
toulon  where he found himself without money and without work  he had a
scene with the mayor  which he describes in his work on  justice  

sainte beuve says that  after his tour of france  his service book being
filled with good certificates  proudhon was promoted to the position
of foreman  but he does not tell us  for the reason that he had no
knowledge of a letter written by fallot  of which we never heard until
six months since  that the printer at that time contemplated quitting
his trade in order to become a teacher 

towards 1829  fallot  who was a little older than proudhon  and
who  after having obtained the suard pension in 1832  died in his
twenty ninth year  while filling the position of assistant librarian at
the institute  was charged  protestant though he was  with the revisal
of a  life of the saints   which was published at besancon  the book was
in latin  and fallot added some notes which also were in latin 


 but   says sainte beuve   it happened that some errors escaped his
attention  which proudhon  then proof reader in the printing office 
did not fail to point out to him  surprised at finding so good a latin
scholar in a workshop  he desired to make his acquaintance  and soon
there sprung up between them a most earnest and intimate friendship  a
friendship of the intellect and of the heart  

addressed to a printer between twenty two and twenty three years of age 
and predicting in formal terms his future fame  fallot s letter seems to
us so interesting that we do not hesitate to reproduce it entire 


 paris  december 5  1831 

 my dear proudhon   you have a right to be surprised at  and even
dissatisfied with  my long delay in replying to your kind letter  i will
tell you the cause of it  it became necessary to forward an account of
your ideas to m  j  de gray  to hear his objections  to reply to them 
and to await his definitive response  which reached me but a short time
ago  for m  j  is a sort of financial king  who takes no pains to be
punctual in dealing with poor devils like ourselves  i  too  am careless
in matters of business  i sometimes push my negligence even to disorder 
and the metaphysical musings which continually occupy my mind  added to
the amusements of paris  render me the most incapable man in the world
for conducting a negotiation with despatch 

 i have m  jobard s decision  here it is  in his judgment  you are
too learned and clever for his children  he fears that you could not
accommodate your mind and character to the childish notions common
to their age and station  in short  he is what the world calls a good
father  that is  he wants to spoil his children  and  in order to do
this easily  he thinks fit to retain his present instructor  who is not
very learned  but who takes part in their games and joyous sports with
wonderful facility  who points out the letters of the alphabet to
the little girl  who takes the little boys to mass  and who  no less
obliging than the worthy abbe p  of our acquaintance  would readily
dance for madame s amusement  such a profession would not suit you  you
who have a free  proud  and manly soul  you are refused  let us dismiss
the matter from our minds  perhaps another time my solicitude will be
less unfortunate  i can only ask your pardon for having thought of thus
disposing of you almost without consulting you  i find my excuse in the
motives which guided me  i had in view your well being and advancement
in the ways of this world 

 i see in your letter  my comrade  through its brilliant witticisms and
beneath the frank and artless gayety with which you have sprinkled it 
a tinge of sadness and despondency which pains me  you are unhappy  my
friend  your present situation does not suit you  you cannot remain in
it  it was not made for you  it is beneath you  you ought  by all
means  to leave it  before its injurious influence begins to affect your
faculties  and before you become settled  as they say  in the ways of
your profession  were it possible that such a thing could ever happen 
which i flatly deny  you are unhappy  you have not yet entered upon the
path which nature has marked out for you  but  faint hearted soul  is
that a cause for despondency  ought you to feel discouraged  struggle 
morbleu  struggle persistently  and you will triumph  j  j  rousseau
groped about for forty years before his genius was revealed to him 
you are not j  j rousseau  but listen  i know not whether i should have
divined the author of  emile  when he was twenty years of age  supposing
that i had been his contemporary  and had enjoyed the honor of his
acquaintance  but i have known you  i have loved you  i have divined
your future  if i may venture to say so  for the first time in my life 
i am going to risk a prophecy  keep this letter  read it again fifteen
or twenty years hence  perhaps twenty five  and if at that time the
prediction which i am about to make has not been fulfilled  burn it as
a piece of folly out of charity and respect for my memory  this is my
prediction  you will be  proudhon  in spite of yourself  inevitably 
by the fact of your destiny  a writer  an author  you will be a
philosopher  you will be one of the lights of the century  and your name
will occupy a place in the annals of the nineteenth century  like those
of gassendi  descartes  malebranche  and bacon in the seventeenth  and
those of diderot  montesquieu  helvetius  locke  hume  and holbach in
the eighteenth  such will be your lot  do now what you will  set type in
a printing office  bring up children  bury yourself in deep seclusion 
seek obscure and lonely villages  it is all one to me  you cannot escape
your destiny  you cannot divest yourself of your noblest feature  that
active  strong  and inquiring mind  with which you are endowed  your
place in the world has been appointed  and it cannot remain empty  go
where you please  i expect you in paris  talking philosophy and the
doctrines of plato  you will have to come  whether you want to or not 
i  who say this to you  must feel very sure of it in order to be willing
to put it upon paper  since  without reward for my prophetic skill   to
which  i assure you  i make not the slightest claim   i run the risk of
passing for a hare brained fellow  in case i prove to be mistaken  he
plays a bold game who risks his good sense upon his cards  in return
for the very trifling and insignificant merit of having divined a young
man s future 

 when i say that i expect you in paris  i use only a proverbial phrase
which you must not allow to mislead you as to my projects and plans 
to reside in paris is disagreeable to me  very much so  and when this
fine art fever which possesses me has left me  i shall abandon the place
without regret to seek a more peaceful residence in a provincial town 
provided always the town shall afford me the means of living  bread  a
bed  books  rest  and solitude  how i miss  my good proudhon  that dark 
obscure  smoky chamber in which i dwelt in besancon  and where we spent
so many pleasant hours in the discussion of philosophy  do you remember
it  but that is now far away  will that happy time ever return  shall
we one day meet again  here my life is restless  uncertain  precarious 
and  what is worse  indolent  illiterate  and vagrant  i do no work  i
live in idleness  i ramble about  i do not read  i no longer study  my
books are forsaken  now and then i glance over a few metaphysical works 
and after a days walk through dirty  filthy  crowded streets  i lie
down with empty head and tired body  to repeat the performance on the
following day  what is the object of these walks  you will ask  i make
visits  my friend  i hold interviews with stupid people  then a fit of
curiosity seizes me  the least inquisitive of beings  there are museums 
libraries  assemblies  churches  palaces  gardens  and theatres to
visit  i am fond of pictures  fond of music  fond of sculpture  all
these are beautiful and good  but they cannot appease hunger  nor take
the place of my pleasant readings of bailly  hume  and tennemann  which
i used to enjoy by my fireside when i was able to read 

 but enough of complaints  do not allow this letter to affect you too
much  and do not think that i give way to dejection or despondency  no 
i am a fatalist  and i believe in my star  i do not know yet what my
calling is  nor for what branch of polite literature i am best fitted 
i do not even know whether i am  or ever shall be  fitted for any  but
what matters it  i suffer  i labor  i dream  i enjoy  i think  and  in a
word  when my last hour strikes  i shall have lived 

 proudhon  i love you  i esteem you  and  believe me  these are not mere
phrases  what interest could i have in flattering and praising a poor
printer  are you rich  that you may pay for courtiers  have you a
sumptuous table  a dashing wife  and gold to scatter  in order to
attract them to your suite  have you the glory  honors  credit  which
would render your acquaintance pleasing to their vanity and pride  no 
you are poor  obscure  abandoned  but  poor  obscure  and abandoned 
you have a friend  and a friend who knows all the obligations which that
word imposes upon honorable people  when they venture to assume it  that
friend is myself  put me to the test 

 gustave fallot  


it appears from this letter that if  at this period  proudhon had
already exhibited to the eyes of a clairvoyant friend his genius for
research and investigation  it was in the direction of philosophical 
rather than of economical and social  questions 

having become foreman in the house of gauthier & co   who carried on
a large printing establishment at besancon  he corrected the proofs of
ecclesiastical writers  the fathers of the church  as they were printing
a bible  a vulgate  he was led to compare the latin with the original
hebrew 


 in this way   says sainte beuve   he learned hebrew by himself  and 
as everything was connected in his mind  he was led to the study of
comparative philology  as the house of gauthier published many works
on church history and theology  he came also to acquire  through this
desire of his to investigate everything  an extensive knowledge of
theology  which afterwards caused misinformed persons to think that he
had been in an ecclesiastical seminary  


towards 1836  proudhon left the house of gauthier  and  in company
with an associate  established a small printing office in besancon  his
contribution to the partnership consisted  not so much in capital  as
in his knowledge of the trade  his partner committing suicide in 1838 
proudhon was obliged to wind up the business  an operation which he did
not accomplish as quickly and as easily as he hoped  he was then urged
by his friends to enter the ranks of the competitors for the suard
pension  this pension consisted of an income of fifteen hundred francs
bequeathed to the academy of besancon by madame suard  the widow of the
academician  to be given once in three years to the young man residing
in the department of doubs  a bachelor of letters or of science  and
not possessing a fortune  whom the academy of besancon should deem best
fitted for a literary or scientific career  or for the study of law
or of medicine  the first to win the suard pension was gustave fallot 
mauvais  who was a distinguished astronomer in the academy of sciences 
was the second  proudhon aspired to be the third  to qualify himself  he
had to be received as a bachelor of letters  and was obliged to write a
letter to the academy of besancon  in a phrase of this letter  the terms
of which he had to modify  though he absolutely refused to change
its spirit  proudhon expressed his firm resolve to labor for the
amelioration of the condition of his brothers  the working men 

the only thing which he had then published was an  essay on general
grammar   which appeared without the author s signature  while
reprinting  at besancon  the  primitive elements of languages 
discovered by the comparison of hebrew roots with those of the latin and
french   by the abbe bergier  proudhon had enlarged the edition of his
 essay on general grammar  

the date of the edition  1837  proves that he did not at that time think
of competing for the suard pension  in this work  which continued and
completed that of the abbe bergier  proudhon adopted the same point
of view  that of moses and of biblical tradition  two years later  in
february  1839  being already in possession of the suard pension  he
addressed to the institute  as a competitor for the volney prize 
a memoir entitled   studies in grammatical classification and the
derivation of some french words   it was his first work  revised and
presented in another form  four memoirs only were sent to the institute 
none of which gained the prize  two honorable mentions were granted 
one of them to memoir no  4  that is  to p  j  proudhon  printer at
besancon  the judges were mm  amedde jaubert  reinaud  and burnouf 


 the committee   said the report presented at the annual meeting of the
five academies on thursday  may 2  1839   has paid especial attention to
manuscripts no  1 and no  4  still  it does not feel able to grant
the prize to either of these works  because they do not appear to
be sufficiently elaborated  the committee  which finds in no  4 some
ingenious analyses  particularly in regard to the mechanism of the
hebrew language  regrets that the author has resorted to hazardous
conjectures  and has sometimes forgotten the special recommendation of
the committee to pursue the experimental and comparative method  


proudhon remembered this  he attended the lectures of eugene burnouf 
and  as soon as he became acquainted with the labors and discoveries of
bopp and his successors  he definitively abandoned an hypothesis which
had been condemned by the academy of inscriptions and belles lettres 
he then sold  for the value of the paper  the remaining copies of the
 essay  published by him in 1837  in 1850  they were still lying in a
grocer s back shop 

a neighboring publisher then placed the edition on the market  with
the attractive name of proudhon upon it  a lawsuit ensued  in which
the author was beaten  his enemies  and at that time there were many of
them  would have been glad to have proved him a renegade and a recanter 
proudhon  in his work on  justice   gives some interesting details of
this lawsuit 

in possession of the suard pension  proudhon took part in the contest
proposed by the academy of besancon on the question of the utility
of the celebration of sunday  his memoir obtained honorable mention 
together with a medal which was awarded him  in open session  on the
24th of august  1839  the reporter of the committee  the abbe doney 
since made bishop of montauban  called attention to the unquestionable
superiority of his talent 


 but   says sainte beuve   he reproached him with having adopted
dangerous theories  and with having touched upon questions of practical
politics and social organization  where upright intentions and zeal for
the public welfare cannot justify rash solutions  


was it policy  we mean prudence  which induced proudhon to screen his
ideas of equality behind the mosaic law  sainte beuve  like many others 
seems to think so  but we remember perfectly well that  having asked
proudhon  in august  1848  if he did not consider himself indebted in
some respects to his fellow countryman  charles fourier  we received
from him the following reply   i have certainly read fourier  and have
spoken of him more than once in my works  but  upon the whole  i do not
think that i owe anything to him  my real masters  those who have caused
fertile ideas to spring up in my mind  are three in number  first  the
bible  next  adam smith  and last  hegel  

freely confessed in the  celebration of sunday   the influence of the
bible on proudhon is no less manifest in his first memoir on property 
proudhon undoubtedly brought to this work many ideas of his own  but
is not the very foundation of ancient jewish law to be found in its
condemnation of usurious interest and its denial of the right of
personal appropriation of land 

the first memoir on property appeared in 1840  under the title   what is
property  or an inquiry into the principle of right and of government  
proudhon dedicated it  in a letter which served as the preface  to the
academy of besancon  the latter  finding itself brought to trial by its
pensioner  took the affair to heart  and evoked it  says sainte beuve 
with all possible haste 

the pension narrowly escaped being immediately withdrawn from the bold
defender of the principle of equality of conditions  m  vivien  then
minister of justice  who was earnestly solicited to prosecute the
author  wished first to obtain the opinion of the economist  blanqui  a
member of the academy of moral and political sciences  proudhon having
presented to this academy a copy of his book  m  blanqui was appointed
to review it  this review  though it opposed proudhon s views  shielded
him  treated as a savant by m  blanqui  the author was not prosecuted 
he was always grateful to mm  blanqui and vivien for their handsome
conduct in the matter 

m  blanqui s review  which was partially reproduced by  le moniteur   on
the 7th of september  1840  naturally led proudhon to address to him  in
the form of a letter  his second memoir on property  which appeared
in april  1841  proudhon had endeavored  in his first memoir  to
demonstrate that the pursuit of equality of conditions is the true
principle of right and of government  in the  letter to m  blanqui   he
passes in review the numerous and varied methods by which this principle
gradually becomes realized in all societies  especially in modern
society 

in 1842  a third memoir appeared  entitled   a notice to proprietors  or
a letter to m  victor considerant  editor of  la phalange   in reply
to a defence of property   here the influence of adam smith manifested
itself  and was frankly admitted  did not adam smith find  in the
principle of equality  the first of all the laws which govern wages 
there are other laws  undoubtedly  but proudhon considers them all as
springing from the principle of property  as he defined it in his first
memoir  thus  in humanity  there are two principles   one which leads us
to equality  another which separates us from it  by the former  we
treat each other as associates  by the latter  as strangers  not to say
enemies  this distinction  which is constantly met with throughout the
three memoirs  contained already  in germ  the idea which gave birth to
the  system of economical contradictions   which appeared in 1846  the
idea of antinomy or contre loi 

the  notice to proprietors  was seized by the magistrates of besancon 
and proudhon was summoned to appear before the assizes of doubs within
a week  he read his written defence to the jurors in person  and was
acquitted  the jury  like m  blanqui  viewed him only as a philosopher 
an inquirer  a savant 

in 1843  proudhon published the  creation of order in humanity   a
large volume  which does not deal exclusively with questions of social
economy  religion  philosophy  method  certainty  logic  and dialectics
are treated at considerable length 

released from his printing office on the 1st of march of the same year 
proudhon had to look for a chance to earn his living  messrs  gauthier
bros   carriers by water between mulhouse and lyons  the eldest of whom
was proudhon s companion in childhood  conceived the happy thought
of employing him  of utilizing his ability in their business  and in
settling the numerous points of difficulty which daily arose  besides
the large number of accounts which his new duties required him to make
out  and which retarded the publication of the  system of economical
contradictions   until october  1846  we ought to mention a work  which 
before it appeared in pamphlet form  was published in the  revue des
economistes     competition between railroads and navigable ways  

 le miserere  or the repentance of a king   which he published in
march  1845  in the  revue independante   during that lenten season when
lacordaire was preaching in lyons  proves that  though devoting himself
with ardor to the study of economical problems  proudhon had not lost
his interest in questions of religious history  among his writings on
these questions  which he was unfortunately obliged to leave unfinished 
we may mention a nearly completed history of the early christian
heresies  and of the struggle of christianity against caesarism 

we have said that  in 1848  proudhon recognized three masters  having
no knowledge of the german language  he could not have read the works
of hegel  which at that time had not been translated into french  it
was charles grun  a german  who had come to france to study the various
philosophical and socialistic systems  who gave him the substance of the
hegelian ideas  during the winter of 1844 45  charles grun had some long
conversations with proudhon  which determined  very decisively  not the
ideas  which belonged exclusively to the bisontin thinker  but the form
of the important work on which he labored after 1843  and which was
published in 1846 by guillaumin 

hegel s great idea  which proudhon appropriated  and which he
demonstrates with wonderful ability in the  system of economical
contradictions   is as follows  antinomy  that is  the existence of two
laws or tendencies which are opposed to each other  is possible 
not only with two different things  but with one and the same thing 
considered in their thesis  that is  in the law or tendency which
created them  all the economical categories are rational   competition 
monopoly  the balance of trade  and property  as well as the division
of labor  machinery  taxation  and credit  but  like communism and
population  all these categories are antinomical  all are opposed  not
only to each other  but to themselves  all is opposition  and disorder
is born of this system of opposition  hence  the sub title of the
work    philosophy of misery   no category can be suppressed  the
opposition  antinomy  or contre tendance  which exists in each of them 
cannot be suppressed 

where  then  lies the solution of the social problem  influenced by the
hegelian ideas  proudhon began to look for it in a superior synthesis 
which should reconcile the thesis and antithesis  afterwards  while at
work upon his book on  justice   he saw that the antinomical terms do
not cancel each other  any more than the opposite poles of an electric
pile destroy each other  that they are the procreative cause of motion 
life  and progress  that the problem is to discover  not their fusion 
which would be death  but their equilibrium   an equilibrium for ever
unstable  varying with the development of society 

on the cover of the  system of economical contradictions   proudhon
announced  as soon to appear  his  solution of the social problem   this
work  upon which he was engaged when the revolution of 1848 broke
out  had to be cut up into pamphlets and newspaper articles  the two
pamphlets  which he published in march  1848  before he became editor
of  le representant du peuple   bear the same title    solution of the
social problem   the first  which is mainly a criticism of the early
acts of the provisional government  is notable from the fact that in
it proudhon  in advance of all others  energetically opposed the
establishment of national workshops  the second   organization of
credit and circulation   sums up in a few pages his idea of economical
progress  a gradual reduction of interest  profit  rent  taxes  and
wages  all progress hitherto has been made in this manner  in this
manner it must continue to be made  those workingmen who favor a nominal
increase of wages are  unconsciously following a back track  opposed to
all their interests 

after having published in  le representant du peuple   the statutes of
the bank of exchange   a bank which was to make no profits  since it
was to have no stockholders  and which  consequently  was to discount
commercial paper with out interest  charging only a commission
sufficient to defray its running expenses   proudhon endeavored  in
a number of articles  to explain its mechanism and necessity  these
articles have been collected in one volume  under the double title 
 resume of the social question  bank of exchange   his other articles 
those which up to december  1848  were inspired by the progress of
events  have been collected in another volume    revolutionary ideas  

almost unknown in march  1848  and struck off in april from the list of
candidates for the constituent assembly by the delegation of workingmen
which sat at the luxembourg  proudhon had but a very small number of
votes at the general elections of april  at the complementary elections 
which were held in the early days of june  he was elected in paris by
seventy seven thousand votes 

after the fatal days of june  he published an article on le terme  which
caused the first suspension of  le representant du peuple   it was at
that time that he introduced a bill into the assembly  which  being
referred to the committee on the finances  drew forth  first  the report
of m  thiers  and then the speech which proudhon delivered  on the
31st of july  in reply to this report   le representant du peuple  
reappearing a few days later  he wrote  a propos of the law requiring
journals to give bonds  his famous article on  the malthusians   august
10  1848  

ten days afterwards   le representant du peuple   again suspended 
definitively ceased to appear   le peuple   of which he was the
editor in chief  and the first number of which was issued in the early
part of september  appeared weekly at first  for want of sufficient
bonds  it afterwards appeared daily  with a double number once a week 
before  le peuple  had obtained its first bond  proudhon published a
remarkable pamphlet on the  right to labor    a right which he denied
in the form in which it was then affirmed  it was during the same
period that he proposed  at the poissonniere banquet  his toast to the
revolution 

proudhon  who had been asked to preside at the banquet  refused  and
proposed in his stead  first  ledru rollin  and then  in view of the
reluctance of the organizers of the banquet  the illustrious president
of the party of the mountain  lamennais  it was evidently his intention
to induce the representatives of the extreme left to proclaim at last
with him the democratic and social republic  lamennais being accepted by
the organizers  the mountain promised to be present at the banquet  the
night before  all seemed right  when general cavaignac replaced minister
senart by minister dufaure vivien  the mountain  questioning the
government  proposed a vote of confidence in the old minister  and 
tacitly  of want of confidence in the new  proudhon abstained from
voting on this proposition  the mountain declared that it would not
attend the banquet  if proudhon was to be present  five montagnards 
mathieu of drome at their head  went to the temporary office of  le
peuple  to notify him of this   citizen proudhon   said they to the
organizers in his presence   in abstaining from voting to day on
the proposition of the mountain  has betrayed the republican cause  
proudhon  vehemently questioned  began his defence by recalling  on
the one hand  the treatment which he had received from the dismissed
minister  and  on the other  the impartial conduct displayed towards him
in 1840 by m  vivien  the new minister  he then attacked the mountain by
telling its delegates that it sought only a pretext  and that really  in
spite of its professions of socialism in private conversation  whether
with him or with the organizers of the banquet  it had not the courage
to publicly declare itself socialist 

on the following day  in his toast to the revolution  a toast which
was filled with allusions to the exciting scene of the night before 
proudhon commenced his struggle against the mountain  his duel with
felix pyat was one of the episodes of this struggle  which became less
bitter on proudhon s side after the mountain finally decided to publicly
proclaim the democratic and social republic  the campaign for the
election of a president of the republic had just begun  proudhon made
a very sharp attack on the candidacy of louis bonaparte in a pamphlet
which is regarded as one of his literary chefs d oeuvre  the  pamphlet
on the presidency   an opponent of this institution  against which he
had voted in the constituent assembly  he at first decided to take no
part in the campaign  but soon seeing that he was thus increasing the
chances of louis bonaparte  and that if  as was not at all probable  the
latter should not obtain an absolute majority of the votes  the assembly
would not fail to elect general cavaignac  he espoused  for the sake of
form  the candidacy of raspail  who was supported by his friends in
the socialist committee  charles delescluze  the editor in chief of
 la revolution democratique et sociale   who could not forgive him for
having preferred raspail to ledru rollin  the candidate of the mountain 
attacked him on the day after the election with a violence which
overstepped all bounds  at first  proudhon had the wisdom to refrain
from answering him  at length  driven to an extremity  he became
aggressive himself  and delescluze sent him his seconds  this time 
proudhon positively refused to fight  he would not have fought with
felix pyat  had not his courage been called in question 

on the 25th of january  1849  proudhon  rising from a sick bed  saw
that the existence of the constituent assembly was endangered by the
coalition of the monarchical parties with louis bonaparte  who was
already planning his coup d etat  he did not hesitate to openly attack
the man who had just received five millions of votes  he wanted to break
the idol  he succeeded only in getting prosecuted and condemned himself 
the prosecution demanded against him was authorized by a majority of the
constituent assembly  in spite of the speech which he delivered on that
occasion  declared guilty by the jury  he was sentenced  in march  1849 
to three years  imprisonment and the payment of a fine of ten thousand
francs 

proudhon had not abandoned for a single moment his project of a bank of
exchange  which was to operate without capital with a sufficient number
of merchants and manufacturers for adherents  this bank  which he then
called the bank of the people  and around which he wished to gather the
numerous working people s associations which had been formed since
the 24th of february  1848  had already obtained a certain number of
subscribers and adherents  the latter to the number of thirty seven
thousand  it was about to commence operations  when proudhon s sentence
forced him to choose between imprisonment and exile  he did not hesitate
to abandon his project and return the money to the subscribers  he
explained the motives which led him to this decision in an article in
 le peuple  

having fled to belgium  he remained there but a few days  going thence
to paris  under an assumed name  to conceal himself in a house in the
rue de chabrol  from his hiding place he sent articles almost every
day  signed and unsigned  to  le peuple   in the evening  dressed in a
blouse  he went to some secluded spot to take the air  soon  emboldened
by habit  he risked an evening promenade upon the boulevards  and
afterwards carried his imprudence so far as to take a stroll by daylight
in the neighborhood of the gare du nord  it was not long before he was
recognized by the police  who arrested him on the 6th of june  1849  in
the rue du faubourg poissonniere 

taken to the office of the prefect of police  then to sainte pelagie 
he was in the conciergerie on the day of the 13th of june  1849  which
ended with the violent suppression of  le peuple   he then began to
write the  confessions of a revolutionist   published towards the end
of the year  he had been again transferred to sainte pelagie  when he
married  in december  1849  mlle  euphrasie piegard  a young working
girl whose hand he had requested in 1847  madame proudhon bore him four
daughters  of whom but two  catherine and stephanie  survived their
father  stephanie died in 1873 

in october  1849   le peuple  was replaced by a new journal   la voix
du peuple   which proudhon edited from his prison cell  in it were
published his discussions with pierre leroux and bastiat 

the political articles which he sent to  la voix du peuple  so
displeased the government finally  that it transferred him to doullens 
where he was secretly confined for some time  afterwards taken back
to paris  to appear before the assizes of the seine in reference to
an article in  la voix du peuple   he was defended by m  cremieux and
acquitted  from the conciergerie he went again to sainte pelagie  where
he ended his three years in prison on the 6th of june  1852 

 la voix du peuple   suppressed before the promulgation of the law of
the 31st of may  had been replaced by a weekly sheet   le peuple  of
1850  established by the aid of the principal members of the mountain 
this journal soon met with the fate of its predecessors 

in 1851  several months before the coup d etat  proudhon published the
 general idea of the revolution of the nineteenth century   in which 
after having shown the logical series of unitary governments   from
monarchy  which is the first term  to the direct government of the
people  which is the last   he opposes the ideal of an archy or
self government to the communistic or governmental ideal 

at this period  the socialist party  discouraged by the elections of
1849  which resulted in a greater conservative triumph than those of
1848  and justly angry with the national representative body which
had just passed the law of the 31st of may  1850  demanded direct
legislation and direct government  proudhon  who did not want  at any
price  the plebiscitary system which he had good reason to regard as
destructive of liberty  did not hesitate to point out  to those of his
friends who expected every thing from direct legislation  one of the
antinomies of universal suffrage  in so far as it is an institution
intended to achieve  for the benefit of the greatest number  the social
reforms to which landed suffrage is opposed  universal suffrage is
powerless  especially if it pretends to legislate or govern directly 
for  until the social reforms are accomplished  the greatest number is
of necessity the least enlightened  and consequently the least capable
of understanding and effecting reforms  in regard to the antinomy 
pointed out by him  of liberty and government   whether the latter be
monarchic  aristocratic  or democratic in form   proudhon  whose chief
desire was to preserve liberty  naturally sought the solution in the
free contract  but though the free contract may be a practical solution
of purely economical questions  it cannot be made use of in politics 
proudhon recognized this ten years later  when his beautiful study on
 war and peace  led him to find in the federative principle the exact
equilibrium of liberty and government 

 the social revolution demonstrated by the coup d  etat  appeared in
1852  a few months after his release from prison  at that time  terror
prevailed to such an extent that no one was willing to publish his
book without express permission from the government  he succeeded in
obtaining this permission by writing to louis bonaparte a letter which
he published at the same time with the work  the latter being offered
for sale  proudhon was warned that he would not be allowed to publish
any more books of the same character  at that time he entertained the
idea of writing a universal history entitled  chronos   this project was
never fulfilled 

already the father of two children  and about to be presented with a
third  proudhon was obliged to devise some immediate means of gaining a
living  he resumed his labors  and published  at first anonymously  the
 manual of a speculator in the stock exchange   later  in 1857  after
having completed the work  he did not hesitate to sign it  acknowledging
in the preface his indebtedness to his collaborator  g  duchene 

meantime  he vainly sought permission to establish a journal  or review 
this permission was steadily refused him  the imperial government
always suspected him after the publication of the  social revolution
demonstrated by the coup d etat  

towards the end of 1853  proudhon issued in belgium a pamphlet entitled
 the philosophy of progress   entirely inoffensive as it was  this
pamphlet  which he endeavored to send into france  was seized on the
frontier  proudhon s complaints were of no avail 

the empire gave grants after grants to large companies  a financial
society  having asked for the grant of a railroad in the east of france 
employed proudhon to write several memoirs in support of this demand 
the grant was given to another company  the author was offered an
indemnity as compensation  to be paid  as was customary in such cases 
by the company which received the grant  it is needless to say that
proudhon would accept nothing  then  wishing to explain to the public 
as well as to the government  the end which he had in view  he
published the work entitled  reforms to be effected in the management of
railroads  

towards the end of 1854  proudhon had already begun his book on
 justice   when he had a violent attack of cholera  from which he
recovered with great difficulty  ever afterwards his health was
delicate 

at last  on the 22d of april  1858  he published  in three large
volumes  the important work upon which he had labored since 1854  this
work had two titles  the first   justice in the revolution and in the
church   the second   new principles of practical philosophy  addressed
to his highness monseigneur mathieu  cardinal archbishop of besancon  
on the 27th of april  when there had scarcely been time to read the
work  an order was issued by the magistrate for its seizure  on the
28th the seizure was effected  to this first act of the magistracy 
the author of the incriminated book replied on the 11th of may in a
strongly motived petition  demanding a revision of the concordat of
1802  or  in other words  a new adjustment of the relations between
church and state  at bottom  this petition was but the logical
consequence of the work itself  an edition of a thousand copies being
published on the 17th of may  the  petition to the senate  was regarded
by the public prosecutor as an aggravation of the offence or offences
discovered in the body of the work to which it was an appendix  and was
seized in its turn on the 23d  on the first of june  the author appealed
to the senate in a second  petition   which was deposited with the
first in the office of the secretary of the assembly  the guardian and
guarantee  according to the constitution of 1852  of the principles
of  89  on the 2d of june  the two processes being united  proudhon
appeared at the bar with his publisher  the printer of the book  and
the printer of the petition  to receive the sentence of the police
magistrate  which condemned him to three years  imprisonment  a fine of
four thousand francs  and the suppression of his work  it is needless
to say that the publisher and printers were also condemned by the sixth
chamber 

proudhon lodged an appeal  he wrote a memoir which the law of 1819  in
the absence of which he would have been liable to a new prosecution 
gave him the power to publish previous to the hearing  having decided
to make use of the means which the law permitted  he urged in vain the
printers who were prosecuted with him to lend him their aid  he then
demanded of attorney general chaix d est ange a statement to the effect
that the twenty third article of the law of the 17th of may  1819 
allows a written defence  and that a printer runs no risk in printing
it  the attorney general flatly refused  proudhon then started for
belgium  where he printed his defence  which could not  of course  cross
the french frontier  this memoir is entitled to rank with the best of
beaumarchais s  it is entitled   justice prosecuted by the church 
an appeal from the sentence passed upon p  j  proudhon by the police
magistrate of the seine  on the 2d of june  1858   a very close
discussion of the grounds of the judgment of the sixth chamber  it was
at the same time an excellent resume of his great work 

once in belgium  proudhon did not fail to remain there  in 1859  after
the general amnesty which followed the italian war  he at first thought
himself included in it  but the imperial government  consulted by his
friends  notified him that  in its opinion  and in spite of the contrary
advice of m  faustin helie  his condemnation was not of a political
character  proudhon  thus classed by the government with the authors
of immoral works  thought it beneath his dignity to protest  and waited
patiently for the advent of 1863 to allow him to return to france 

in belgium  where he was not slow in forming new friendships  he
published in 1859 60  in separate parts  a new edition of his great work
on  justice   each number contained  in addition to the original text
carefully reviewed and corrected  numerous explanatory notes and some
 tidings of the revolution   in these tidings  which form a sort of
review of the progress of ideas in europe  proudhon sorrowfully
asserts that  after having for a long time marched at the head of the
progressive nations  france has become  without appearing to suspect it 
the most retrogressive of nations  and he considers her more than once
as seriously threatened with moral death 

the italian war led him to write a new work  which he published in 1861 
entitled  war and peace   this work  in which  running counter to
a multitude of ideas accepted until then without examination  he
pronounced for the first time against the restoration of an aristocratic
and priestly poland  and against the establishment of a unitary
government in italy  created for him a multitude of enemies  most of
his friends  disconcerted by his categorical affirmation of a right
of force  notified him that they decidedly disapproved of his new
publication   you see   triumphantly cried those whom he had always
combated   this man is only a sophist  

led by his previous studies to test every thing by the question of
right  proudhon asks  in his  war and peace   whether there is a real
right of which war is the vindication  and victory the demonstration 
this right  which he roughly calls the right of the strongest or the
right of force  and which is  after all  only the right of the most
worthy to the preference in certain definite cases  exists  says
proudhon  independently of war  it cannot be legitimately vindicated
except where necessity clearly demands the subordination of one will to
another  and within the limits in which it exists  that is  without ever
involving the enslavement of one by the other  among nations  the right
of the majority  which is only a corollary of the right of force  is
as unacceptable as universal monarchy  hence  until equilibrium is
established and recognized between states or national forces  there must
be war  war  says proudhon  is not always necessary to determine which
side is the strongest  and he has no trouble in proving this by examples
drawn from the family  the workshop  and elsewhere  passing then to the
study of war  he proves that it by no means corresponds in practice to
that which it ought to be according to his theory of the right of force 
the systematic horrors of war naturally lead him to seek a cause for
it other than the vindication of this right  and then only does the
economist take it upon himself to denounce this cause to those who  like
himself  want peace  the necessity of finding abroad a compensation
for the misery resulting in every nation from the absence of economical
equilibrium  is  according to proudhon  the ever real  though ever
concealed  cause of war  the pages devoted to this demonstration and to
his theory of poverty  which he clearly distinguishes from misery and
pauperism  shed entirely new light upon the philosophy of history  as
for the author s conclusion  it is a very simple one  since the treaty
of westphalia  and especially since the treaties of 1815  equilibrium
has been the international law of europe  it remains now  not to destroy
it  but  while maintaining it  to labor peacefully  in every nation
protected by it  for the equilibrium of economical forces  the last line
of the book  evidently written to check imperial ambition  is   humanity
wants no more war  

in 1861  after garibaldi s expedition and the battle of castelfidardo 
proudhon immediately saw that the establishment of italian unity would
be a severe blow to european equilibrium  it was chiefly in order to
maintain this equilibrium that he pronounced so energetically in
favor of italian federation  even though it should be at first only
a federation of monarchs  in vain was it objected that  in being
established by france  italian unity would break european equilibrium in
our favor  proudhon  appealing to history  showed that every state which
breaks the equilibrium in its own favor only causes the other states to
combine against it  and thereby diminishes its influence and power  he
added that  nations being essentially selfish  italy would not fail 
when opportunity offered  to place her interest above her gratitude 

to maintain european equilibrium by diminishing great states and
multiplying small ones  to unite the latter in organized federations 
not for attack  but for defence  and with these federations  which  if
they were not republican already  would quickly become so  to hold in
check the great military monarchies   such  in the beginning of 1861 
was the political programme of proudhon 

the object of the federations  he said  will be to guarantee  as far as
possible  the beneficent reign of peace  and they will have the
further effect of securing in every nation the triumph of liberty over
despotism  where the largest unitary state is  there liberty is in the
greatest danger  further  if this state be democratic  despotism without
the counterpoise of majorities is to be feared  with the federation  it
is not so  the universal suffrage of the federal state is checked by the
universal suffrage of the federated states  and the latter is offset in
its turn by property  the stronghold of liberty  which it tends  not to
destroy  but to balance with the institutions of mutualism 

all these ideas  and many others which were only hinted at in his
work on  war and peace   were developed by proudhon in his subsequent
publications  one of which has for its motto   reforms always  utopias
never   the thinker had evidently finished his evolution 

the council of state of the canton of vaud having offered prizes for
essays on the question of taxation  previously discussed at a congress
held at lausanne  proudhon entered the ranks and carried off the first
prize  his memoir was published in 1861 under the title of  the theory
of taxation  

about the same time  he wrote at brussels  in  l office de publicite  
some remarkable articles on the question of literary property  which
was discussed at a congress held in belgium  these articles must not be
confounded with  literary majorats   a more complete work on the same
subject  which was published in 1863  soon after his return to france 

arbitrarily excepted from the amnesty in 1859  proudhon was pardoned two
years later by a special act  he did not wish to take advantage of this
favor  and seemed resolved to remain in belgium until the 2d of june 
1863  the time when he was to acquire the privilege of prescription 
when an absurd and ridiculous riot  excited in brussels by an article
published by him on federation and unity in italy  induced him to hasten

he lived  in the faubourg d ixelles  after having placed his wife and
daughters in safety among his friends at brussels  he arrived in paris

pretext for the rioters in brussels 

among the works begun by proudhon while in belgium  which death did not
allow him to finish  we ought to mention a  history of poland   which

 the principle of art and its social destiny

proudhon labored constantly     a series of articles  published in 1864
in  le messager de paris   have been collected in a pamphlet under the
title of  new observations on italian unity   he hoped to publish
during the same year his work on  the political capacity of the working
classes   but was unable to write the last chapter     he grew weaker
continually  his doctor prescribed rest  in the month of august he went
to franche comte  where he spent a month  having returned to paris 
he resumed his labor with difficulty     from the month of december
onwards  the heart disease made rapid progress  the oppression became
insupportable  his legs were swollen  and he could not sleep    

on the 19th of january  1865  he died  towards two o clock in the
morning  in the arms of his wife  his sister in law  and the friend who
writes these lines    

the publication of his correspondence  to which his daughter catherine
is faithfully devoted  will tend  no doubt  to increase his reputation
as a thinker  as a writer  and as an honest man

preface 

the following letter served as a preface to the first edition of this
memoir   


 to the members of the academy of besancon

 paris  june 30  1840 


 gentlemen   in the course of your debate of the 9th of may  1833 
in regard to the triennial pension established by madame suard  you
expressed the following wish   

  the academy requests the titulary to present it annually  during the
first fortnight in july  with a succinct and logical statement of the
various studies which he has pursued during the year which has just
expired  

 i now propose  gentlemen  to discharge this duty 

 when i solicited your votes  i boldly avowed my intention to bend my
efforts to the discovery of some means of ameliorating the physical 
moral  and intellectual condition of the mere numerous and poorer
classes  this idea  foreign as it may have seemed to the object of my
candidacy  you received favorably  and  by the precious distinction with
which it has been your pleasure to honor me  you changed this formal
offer into an inviolable and sacred obligation  thenceforth i understood
with how worthy and honorable a society i had to deal  my regard for
its enlightenment  my recognition of its benefits  my enthusiasm for its
glory  were unbounded 

 convinced at once that  in order to break loose from the beaten paths
of opinions and systems  it was necessary to proceed in my study of man
and society by scientific methods  and in a rigorous manner  i devoted
one year to philology and grammar  linguistics  or the natural history
of speech  being  of all the sciences  that which was best suited to
the character of my mind  seemed to bear the closest relation to the
researches which i was about to commence  a treatise  written at
this period upon one of the most interesting questions of comparative
grammar  2  if it did not reveal the astonishing success  at least bore
witness to the thoroughness  of my labors 

 since that time  metaphysics and moral science have been my only
studies  my perception of the fact that these sciences  though badly
defined as to their object and not confined to their sphere  are  like
the natural sciences  susceptible of demonstration and certainty  has
already rewarded my efforts 

 but  gentlemen  of all the masters whom i have followed  to none do
i owe so much as to you  your co operation  your programmes  your
instructions  in agreement with my secret wishes and most cherished
hopes  have at no time failed to enlighten me and to point out my road 
this memoir on property is the child of your thought 

 in 1838  the academy of besancon proposed the following question 
to what causes must we attribute the continually increasing number of
suicides  and what are the proper means for arresting the effects of
this moral contagion 

 thereby it asked  in less general terms  what was the cause of the
social evil  and what was its remedy  you admitted that yourselves 
gentlemen when your committee reported that the competitors had
enumerated with exactness the immediate and particular causes of
suicide  as well as the means of preventing each of them  but that
from this enumeration  chronicled with more or less skill  no positive
information had been gained  either as to the primary cause of the evil 
or as to its remedy 

 in 1839  your programme  always original and varied in its academical
expression  became more exact  the investigations of 1838 had pointed
out  as the causes or rather as the symptoms of the social malady 
the neglect of the principles of religion and morality  the desire for
wealth  the passion for enjoyment  and political disturbances  all these
data were embodied by you in a single proposition   the utility of the
celebration of sunday as regards hygiene  morality  and social and
political relation  

 in a christian tongue you asked  gentlemen  what was the true system
of society  a competitor  3  dared to maintain  and believed that he
had proved  that the institution of a day of rest at weekly intervals
is inseparably bound up with a political system based on the equality of
conditions  that without equality this institution is an anomaly and
an impossibility  that equality alone can revive this ancient and
mysterious keeping of the seventh day  this argument did not meet with
your approbation  since  without denying the relation pointed out by
the competitor  you judged  and rightly gentlemen  that the principle of
equality of conditions not being demonstrated  the ideas of the author
were nothing more than hypotheses 

 finally  gentlemen  this fundamental principle of equality you
presented for competition in the following terms  the economical and
moral consequences in france up to the present time  and those which
seem likely to appear in future  of the law concerning the equal
division of hereditary property between the children 

 instead of confining one to common places without breadth or
significance  it seems to me that your question should be developed as
follows   

 if the law has been able to render the right of heredity common to
all the children of one father  can it not render it equal for all his
grandchildren and great grandchildren 

 if the law no longer heeds the age of any member of the family  can
it not  by the right of heredity  cease to heed it in the race  in the
tribe  in the nation 

 can equality  by the right of succession  be preserved between
citizens  as well as between cousins and brothers  in a word  can the
principle of succession become a principle of equality 

 to sum up all these ideas in one inclusive question  what is the
principle of heredity  what are the foundations of inequality  what is
property 

 such  gentlemen  is the object of the memoir that i offer you to day 

 if i have rightly grasped the object of your thought  if i succeed in
bringing to light a truth which is indisputable  but  from causes
which i am bold enough to claim to have explained  has always been
misunderstood  if by an infallible method of investigation  i establish
the dogma of equality of conditions  if i determine the principle
of civil law  the essence of justice  and the form of society  if i
annihilate property forever   to you  gentlemen  will redound all the
glory  for it is to your aid and your inspiration that i owe it 

 my purpose in this work is the application of method to the problems of
philosophy  every other intention is foreign to and even abusive of it 

 i have spoken lightly of jurisprudence  i had the right  but i should
be unjust did i not distinguish between this pretended science and
the men who practise it  devoted to studies both laborious and severe 
entitled in all respects to the esteem of their fellow citizens by their
knowledge and eloquence our legists deserve but one reproach  that of an
excessive deference to arbitrary laws 

 i have been pitiless in my criticism of the economists  for them
i confess that  in general  i have no liking  the arrogance and
the emptiness of their writings  their impertinent pride and their
unwarranted blunders  have disgusted me  whoever  knowing them  pardons
them  may read them 

 i have severely blamed the learned christian church  it was my duty 
this blame results from the facts which i call attention to  why has
the church decreed concerning things which it does not understand  the
church has erred in dogma and in morals  physics and mathematics
testify against her  it may be wrong for me to say it  but surely it
is unfortunate for christianity that it is true  to restore religion 
gentlemen  it is necessary to condemn the church 

 perhaps you will regret  gentlemen  that  in giving all my attention to
method and evidence  i have too much neglected form and style  in vain
should i have tried to do better  literary hope and faith i have none 
the nineteenth century is  in my eyes  a genesic era  in which new
principles are elaborated  but in which nothing that is written shall
endure  that is the reason  in my opinion  why  among so many men of
talent  france to day counts not one great writer  in a society like
ours  to seek for literary glory seems to me an anachronism  of what
use is it to invoke an ancient sibyl when a muse is on the eve of birth 
pitiable actors in a tragedy nearing its end  that which it behooves us
to do is to precipitate the catastrophe  the most deserving among us
is he who plays best this part  well  i no longer aspire to this sad
success 

 why should i not confess it  gentlemen  i have aspired to your
suffrages and sought the title of your pensioner  hating all which
exists and full of projects for its destruction  i shall finish this
investigation in a spirit of calm and philosophical resignation  i have
derived more peace from the knowledge of the truth  than anger from the
feeling of oppression  and the most precious fruit that i could wish to
gather from this memoir would be the inspiration of my readers with that
tranquillity of soul which arises from the clear perception of evil and
its cause  and which is much more powerful than passion and enthusiasm 
my hatred of privilege and human authority was unbounded  perhaps at
times i have been guilty  in my indignation  of confounding persons and
things  at present i can only despise and complain  to cease to hate i
only needed to know 

 it is for you now  gentlemen  whose mission and character are the
proclamation of the truth  it is for you to instruct the people  and to
tell them for what they ought to hope and what they ought to fear  the
people  incapable as yet of sound judgment as to what is best for them 
applaud indiscriminately the most opposite ideas  provided that in them
they get a taste of flattery  to them the laws of thought are like the
confines of the possible  to day they can no more distinguish between a
savant and a sophist  than formerly they could tell a physician from
a sorcerer   inconsiderately accepting  gathering together  and
accumulating everything that is new  regarding all reports as true and
indubitable  at the breath or ring of novelty they assemble like bees at
the sound of a basin    4 

 may you  gentlemen  desire equality as i myself desire it  may you 
for the eternal happiness of our country  become its propagators and its
heralds  may i be the last of your pensioners  of all the wishes that
i can frame  that  gentlemen  is the most worthy of you and the most
honorable for me 

 i am  with the profoundest respect and the most earnest gratitude 

 your pensioner 

 p  j  proudhon  


two months after the receipt of this letter  the academy  in its debate
of august 24th  replied to the address of its pensioner by a note  the
text of which i give below   


 a member calls the attention of the academy to a pamphlet  published
last june by the titulary of the suard pension  entitled   what is
property   and dedicated by the author to the academy  he is of the
opinion that the society owes it to justice  to example  and to its
own dignity  to publicly disavow all responsibility for the anti social
doctrines contained in this publication  in consequence he demands 

 1  that the academy disavow and condemn  in the most formal manner 
the work of the suard pensioner  as having been published without its
assent  and as attributing to it opinions diametrically opposed to the
principles of each of its members 

 2  that the pensioner be charged  in case he should publish a second
edition of his book  to omit the dedication 

 3  that this judgment of the academy be placed upon the records 

 these three propositions  put to vote  are adopted  


after this ludicrous decree  which its authors thought to render
powerful by giving it the form of a contradiction  i can only beg the
reader not to measure the intelligence of my compatriots by that of our
academy 

while my patrons in the social and political sciences were fulminating
anathemas against my brochure  a man  who was a stranger to
franche comte  who did not know me  who might even have regarded himself
as personally attacked by the too sharp judgment which i had passed upon
the economists  a publicist as learned as he was modest  loved by the
people whose sorrows he felt  honored by the power which he sought to
enlighten without flattering or disgracing it  m  blanqui  member of the
institute  professor of political economy  defender of property  took up
my defence before his associates and before the ministry  and saved me
from the blows of a justice which is always blind  because it is always
ignorant 

it seems to me that the reader will peruse with pleasure the letter
which m  blanqui did me the honor to write to me upon the publication
of my second memoir  a letter as honorable to its author as it is
flattering to him to whom it is addressed 



 paris  may 1  1841 

 monsieur   i hasten to thank you for forwarding to me your second
memoir upon property  i have read it with all the interest that an
acquaintance with the first would naturally inspire  i am very glad that
you have modified somewhat the rudeness of form which gave to a work
of such gravity the manner and appearance of a pamphlet  for you quite
frightened me  sir  and your talent was needed to reassure me in regard
to your intentions  one does not expend so much real knowledge with
the purpose of inflaming his country  this proposition  now coming into
notice  property is robbery   was of a nature to repel from your book
even those serious minds who do not judge by appearances  had you
persisted in maintaining it in its rude simplicity  but if you have
softened the form  you are none the less faithful to the ground work
of your doctrines  and although you have done me the honor to give me a
share in this perilous teaching  i cannot accept a partnership which 
as far as talent goes  would surely be a credit to me  but which would
compromise me in all other respects 

 i agree with you in one thing only  namely  that all kinds of property
get too frequently abused in this world  but i do not reason from the
abuse to the abolition   an heroic remedy too much like death  which
cures all evils  i will go farther  i will confess that  of all abuses 
the most hateful to me are those of property  but once more  there is
a remedy for this evil without violating it  all the more without
destroying it  if the present laws allow abuse  we can reconstruct them 
our civil code is not the koran  it is not wrong to examine it  change 
then  the laws which govern the use of property  but be sparing of
anathemas  for  logically  where is the honest man whose hands are
entirely clean  do you think that one can be a robber without knowing
it  without wishing it  without suspecting it  do you not admit that
society in its present state  like every man  has in its constitution
all kinds of virtues and vices inherited from our ancestors  is
property  then  in your eyes a thing so simple and so abstract that you
can re knead and equalize it  if i may so speak  in your metaphysical
mill  one who has said as many excellent and practical things as occur
in these two beautiful and paradoxical improvisations of yours cannot
be a pure and unwavering utopist  you are too well acquainted with the
economical and academical phraseology to play with the hard words
of revolutions  i believe  then  that you have handled property as
rousseau  eighty years ago  handled letters  with a magnificent and
poetical display of wit and knowledge  such  at least  is my opinion 

 that is what i said to the institute at the time when i presented my
report upon your book  i knew that they wished to proceed against you in
the courts  you perhaps do not know by how narrow a chance i succeeded
in preventing them   5  what chagrin i should always have felt  if
the king s counsel  that is to say  the intellectual executioner  had
followed in my very tracks to attack your book and annoy your person  i
actually passed two terrible nights  and i succeeded in restraining
the secular arm only by showing that your book was an academical
dissertation  and not the manifesto of an incendiary  your style is too
lofty ever to be of service to the madmen who in discussing the gravest
questions of our social order  use paving stones as their weapons  but
see to it  sir  that ere long they do not come  in spite of you  to
seek for ammunition in this formidable arsenal  and that your
vigorous metaphysics falls not into the hands of some sophist of the
market place  who might discuss the question in the presence of a
starving audience  we should have pillage for conclusion and peroration 

 i feel as deeply as you  sir  the abuses which you point out  but i
have so great an affection for order   not that common and strait laced
order with which the police are satisfied  but the majestic and imposing
order of human societies   that i sometimes find myself embarrassed
in attacking certain abuses  i like to rebuild with one hand when i am
compelled to destroy with the other  in pruning an old tree  we guard
against destruction of the buds and fruit  you know that as well as any
one  you are a wise and learned man  you have a thoughtful mind  the
terms by which you characterize the fanatics of our day are strong
enough to reassure the most suspicious imaginations as to your
intentions  but you conclude in favor of the abolition of property  you
wish to abolish the most powerful motor of the human mind  you attack
the paternal sentiment in its sweetest illusions  with one word you
arrest the formation of capital  and we build henceforth upon the sand
instead of on a rock  that i cannot agree to  and for that reason i
have criticised your book  so full of beautiful pages  so brilliant with
knowledge and fervor 

 i wish  sir  that my impaired health would permit me to examine with
you  page by page  the memoir which you have done me the honor to
address to me publicly and personally  i think i could offer some
important criticisms  for the moment  i must content myself with
thanking you for the kind words in which you have seen fit to speak of
me  we each possess the merit of sincerity  i desire also the merit
of prudence  you know how deep seated is the disease under which the
working people are suffering  i know how many noble hearts beat under
those rude garments  and i feel an irresistible and fraternal sympathy
with the thousands of brave people who rise early in the morning to
labor  to pay their taxes  and to make our country strong  i try to
serve and enlighten them  whereas some endeavor to mislead them  you
have not written directly for them  you have issued two magnificent
manifestoes  the second more guarded than the first  issue a third more
guarded than the second  and you will take high rank in science  whose
first precept is calmness and impartiality 

 farewell  sir  no man s esteem for another can exceed mine for you 

 blanqui  


i should certainly take some exceptions to this noble and eloquent
letter  but i confess that i am more inclined to realize the prediction
with which it terminates than to augment needlessly the number of
my antagonists  so much controversy fatigues and wearies me  the
intelligence expended in the warfare of words is like that employed in
battle  it is intelligence wasted  m  blanqui acknowledges that property
is abused in many harmful ways  i call property the sum these abuses
exclusively  to each of us property seems a polygon whose angles need
knocking off  but  the operation performed  m  blanqui maintains
that the figure will still be a polygon  an hypothesis admitted in
mathematics  although not proven   while i consider that this figure
will be a circle  honest people can at least understand one another 

for the rest  i allow that  in the present state of the question  the
mind may legitimately hesitate before deciding in favor of the abolition
of property  to gain the victory for one s cause  it does not suffice
simply to overthrow a principle generally recognized  which has the
indisputable merit of systematically recapitulating our political
theories  it is also necessary to establish the opposite principle  and
to formulate the system which must proceed from it  still further  it
is necessary to show the method by which the new system will satisfy
all the moral and political needs which induced the establishment of
the first  on the following conditions  then  of subsequent evidence 
depends the correctness of my preceding arguments   

the discovery of a system of absolute equality in which all existing
institutions  save property  or the sum of the abuses of property 
not only may find a place  but may themselves serve as instruments
of equality  individual liberty  the division of power  the public
ministry  the jury system  administrative and judicial organization  the
unity and completeness of instruction  marriage  the family  heredity
in direct and collateral succession  the right of sale and exchange  the
right to make a will  and even birthright   a system which  better than
property  guarantees the formation of capital and keeps up the courage
of all  which  from a superior point of view  explains  corrects  and
completes the theories of association hitherto proposed  from plato
and pythagoras to babeuf  saint simon  and fourier  a system  finally 
which  serving as a means of transition  is immediately applicable 

a work so vast requires  i am aware  the united efforts of twenty
montesquieus  nevertheless  if it is not given to a single man to
finish  a single one can commence  the enterprise  the road that he
shall traverse will suffice to show the end and assure the result 





what is property  or 

an inquiry into the principle of right and of government 




first memoir 

      adversus hostem aeterna auctertas esto  

     against the enemy  revendication is eternal  law of the
     twelve tables 




chapter i  method pursued in this work   the idea of a revolution 

if i were asked to answer the following question  what is slavery  and i
should answer in one word  it is murder  my meaning would be understood
at once  no extended argument would be required to show that the power
to take from a man his thought  his will  his personality  is a power of
life and death  and that to enslave a man is to kill him  why  then  to
this other question  what is property  may i not likewise answer  it
is robbery  without the certainty of being misunderstood  the second
proposition being no other than a transformation of the first 

i undertake to discuss the vital principle of our government and our
institutions  property  i am in my right  i may be mistaken in the
conclusion which shall result from my investigations  i am in my right 
i think best to place the last thought of my book first  still am i in
my right 

such an author teaches that property is a civil right  born of
occupation and sanctioned by law  another maintains that it is a natural
right  originating in labor   and both of these doctrines  totally
opposed as they may seem  are encouraged and applauded  i contend that
neither labor  nor occupation  nor law  can create property  that it is
an effect without a cause  am i censurable 

but murmurs arise 

property is robbery  that is the war cry of  93  that is the signal of
revolutions 

reader  calm yourself  i am no agent of discord  no firebrand of
sedition  i anticipate history by a few days  i disclose a truth whose
development we may try in vain to arrest  i write the preamble of
our future constitution  this proposition which seems to you
blasphemous  property is robbery  would  if our prejudices allowed us
to consider it  be recognized as the lightning rod to shield us from the
coming thunderbolt  but too many interests stand in the way     alas 
philosophy will not change the course of events  destiny will fulfill
itself regardless of prophecy  besides  must not justice be done and our
education be finished 

property is robbery     what a revolution in human ideas  proprietor and
robber have been at all times expressions as contradictory as the beings
whom they designate are hostile  all languages have perpetuated this
opposition  on what authority  then  do you venture to attack universal
consent  and give the lie to the human race  who are you  that you
should question the judgment of the nations and the ages 

of what consequence to you  reader  is my obscure individuality  i
live  like you  in a century in which reason submits only to fact and
to evidence  my name  like yours  is truth seeker   6  my mission is
written in these words of the law  speak without hatred and without
fear  tell that which thou knowest  the work of our race is to build the
temple of science  and this science includes man and nature  now  truth
reveals itself to all  to day to newton and pascal  tomorrow to
the herdsman in the valley and the journeyman in the shop  each one
contributes his stone to the edifice  and  his task accomplished 
disappears  eternity precedes us  eternity follows us  between two
infinites  of what account is one poor mortal that the century should
inquire about him 

disregard then  reader  my title and my character  and attend only to my
arguments  it is in accordance with universal consent that i undertake
to correct universal error  from the opinion of the human race i appeal
to its faith  have the courage to follow me  and  if your will is
untrammelled  if your conscience is free  if your mind can unite two
propositions and deduce a third therefrom  my ideas will inevitably
become yours  in beginning by giving you my last word  it was my purpose
to warn you  not to defy you  for i am certain that  if you read me  you
will be compelled to assent  the things of which i am to speak are so
simple and clear that you will be astonished at not having perceived
them before  and you will say   i have neglected to think   others offer
you the spectacle of genius wresting nature s secrets from her  and
unfolding before you her sublime messages  you will find here only a
series of experiments upon justice and right a sort of verification of
the weights and measures of your conscience  the operations shall be
conducted under your very eyes  and you shall weigh the result 

nevertheless  i build no system  i ask an end to privilege  the
abolition of slavery  equality of rights  and the reign of law  justice 
nothing else  that is the alpha and omega of my argument  to others i
leave the business of governing the world 

one day i asked myself  why is there so much sorrow and misery in
society  must man always be wretched  and not satisfied with the
explanations given by the reformers   these attributing the general
distress to governmental cowardice and incapacity  those to conspirators
and emeutes  still others to ignorance and general corruption   and
weary of the interminable quarrels of the tribune and the press  i
sought to fathom the matter myself  i have consulted the masters of
science  i have read a hundred volumes of philosophy  law  political
economy  and history  would to god that i had lived in a century in
which so much reading had been useless  i have made every effort to
obtain exact information  comparing doctrines  replying to objections 
continually constructing equations and reductions from arguments  and
weighing thousands of syllogisms in the scales of the most rigorous
logic  in this laborious work  i have collected many interesting facts
which i shall share with my friends and the public as soon as i have
leisure  but i must say that i recognized at once that we had never
understood the meaning of these words  so common and yet so sacred 
justice  equity  liberty  that concerning each of these principles our
ideas have been utterly obscure  and  in fact  that this ignorance was
the sole cause  both of the poverty that devours us  and of all the
calamities that have ever afflicted the human race 

my mind was frightened by this strange result  i doubted my reason 
what  said i  that which eye has not seen  nor ear heard  nor insight
penetrated  you have discovered  wretch  mistake not the visions of
your diseased brain for the truths of science  do you not know  great
philosophers have said so  that in points of practical morality
universal error is a contradiction 

i resolved then to test my arguments  and in entering upon this new
labor i sought an answer to the following questions  is it possible
that humanity can have been so long and so universally mistaken in the
application of moral principles  how and why could it be mistaken  how
can its error  being universal  be capable of correction 

these questions  on the solution of which depended the certainty of my
conclusions  offered no lengthy resistance to analysis  it will be seen 
in chapter v  of this work  that in morals  as in all other branches of
knowledge  the gravest errors are the dogmas of science  that  even in
works of justice  to be mistaken is a privilege which ennobles man  and
that whatever philosophical merit may attach to me is infinitely small 
to name a thing is easy  the difficulty is to discern it before its
appearance  in giving expression to the last stage of an idea   an idea
which permeates all minds  which to morrow will be proclaimed by another
if i fail to announce it to day   i can claim no merit save that of
priority of utterance  do we eulogize the man who first perceives the
dawn 

yes  all men believe and repeat that equality of conditions is identical
with equality of rights  that property and robbery are synonymous terms 
that every social advantage accorded  or rather usurped  in the name of
superior talent or service  is iniquity and extortion  all men in their
hearts  i say  bear witness to these truths  they need only to be made
to understand it 

before entering directly upon the question before me  i must say a word
of the road that i shall traverse  when pascal approached a geometrical
problem  he invented a method of solution  to solve a problem in
philosophy a method is equally necessary  well  by how much do the
problems of which philosophy treats surpass in the gravity of their
results those discussed by geometry  how much more imperatively  then 
do they demand for their solution a profound and rigorous analysis 

it is a fact placed for ever beyond doubt  say the modern psychologists 
that every perception received by the mind is determined by certain
general laws which govern the mind  is moulded  so to speak  in certain
types pre existing in our understanding  and which constitutes its
original condition  hence  say they  if the mind has no innate ideas 
it has at least innate forms  thus  for example  every phenomenon is of
necessity conceived by us as happening in time and space   that compels
us to infer a cause of its occurrence  every thing which exists implies
the ideas of substance  mode  relation  number  &c   in a word  we form
no idea which is not related to some one of the general principles of
reason  independent of which nothing exists 

these axioms of the understanding  add the psychologists  these
fundamental types  by which all our judgments and ideas are inevitably
shaped  and which our sensations serve only to illuminate  are known
in the schools as categories  their primordial existence in the mind is
to day demonstrated  they need only to be systematized and catalogued 
aristotle recognized ten  kant increased the number to fifteen  m 
cousin has reduced it to three  to two  to one  and the indisputable
glory of this professor will be due to the fact that  if he has not
discovered the true theory of categories  he has  at least  seen more
clearly than any one else the vast importance of this question   the
greatest and perhaps the only one with which metaphysics has to deal 

i confess that i disbelieve in the innateness  not only of ideas  but
also of forms or laws of our understanding  and i hold the metaphysics
of reid and kant to be still farther removed from the truth than that of
aristotle  however  as i do not wish to enter here into a discussion of
the mind  a task which would demand much labor and be of no interest to
the public  i shall admit the hypothesis that our most general and
most necessary ideas  such as time  space  substance  and cause  exist
originally in the mind  or  at least  are derived immediately from its
constitution 

but it is a psychological fact none the less true  and one to which the
philosophers have paid too little attention  that habit  like a second
nature  has the power of fixing in the mind new categorical forms
derived from the appearances which impress us  and by them usually
stripped of objective reality  but whose influence over our judgments
is no less predetermining than that of the original categories  hence
we reason by the eternal and absolute laws of our mind  and at the same
time by the secondary rules  ordinarily faulty  which are suggested to
us by imperfect observation  this is the most fecund source of false
prejudices  and the permanent and often invincible cause of a multitude
of errors  the bias resulting from these prejudices is so strong that
often  even when we are fighting against a principle which our mind
thinks false  which is repugnant to our reason  and which our conscience
disapproves  we defend it without knowing it  we reason in accordance
with it  and we obey it while attacking it  enclosed within a circle 
our mind revolves about itself  until a new observation  creating within
us new ideas  brings to view an external principle which delivers us
from the phantom by which our imagination is possessed 

thus  we know to day that  by the laws of a universal magnetism whose
cause is still unknown  two bodies  no obstacle intervening  tend to
unite by an accelerated impelling force which we call gravitation  it is
gravitation which causes unsupported bodies to fall to the ground  which
gives them weight  and which fastens us to the earth on which we live 
ignorance of this cause was the sole obstacle which prevented the
ancients from believing in the antipodes   can you not see   said st 
augustine after lactantius   that  if there were men under our feet 
their heads would point downward  and that they would fall into the
sky   the bishop of hippo  who thought the earth flat because it
appeared so to the eye  supposed in consequence that  if we should
connect by straight lines the zenith with the nadir in different places 
these lines would be parallel with each other  and in the direction
of these lines he traced every movement from above to below  thence he
naturally concluded that the stars were rolling torches set in the vault
of the sky  that  if left to themselves  they would fall to the earth in
a shower of fire  that the earth was one vast plain  forming the lower
portion of the world  &c  if he had been asked by what the world itself
was sustained  he would have answered that he did not know  but that
to god nothing is impossible  such were the ideas of st  augustine in
regard to space and movement  ideas fixed within him by a prejudice
derived from an appearance  and which had become with him a general and
categorical rule of judgment  of the reason why bodies fall his mind
knew nothing  he could only say that a body falls because it falls 

with us the idea of a fall is more complex  to the general ideas of
space and movement which it implies  we add that of attraction or
direction towards a centre  which gives us the higher idea of cause  but
if physics has fully corrected our judgment in this respect  we still
make use of the prejudice of st  augustine  and when we say that a thing
has fallen  we do not mean simply and in general that there has been
an effect of gravitation  but specially and in particular that it is
towards the earth  and from above to below  that this movement has taken
place  our mind is enlightened in vain  the imagination prevails  and
our language remains forever incorrigible  to descend from heaven is as
incorrect an expression as to mount to heaven  and yet this expression
will live as long as men use language 

all these phrases  from above to below  to descend from heaven  to fall
from the clouds  &c   are henceforth harmless  because we know how to
rectify them in practice  but let us deign to consider for a moment how
much they have retarded the progress of science  if  indeed  it be a
matter of little importance to statistics  mechanics  hydrodynamics  and
ballistics  that the true cause of the fall of bodies should be known 
and that our ideas of the general movements in space should be exact 
it is quite otherwise when we undertake to explain the system of the
universe  the cause of tides  the shape of the earth  and its position
in the heavens  to understand these things we must leave the circle
of appearances  in all ages there have been ingenious mechanicians 
excellent architects  skilful artillerymen  any error  into which it was
possible for them to fall in regard to the rotundity of the earth and
gravitation  in no wise retarded the development of their art  the
solidity of their buildings and accuracy of their aim was not affected
by it  but sooner or later they were forced to grapple with phenomena 
which the supposed parallelism of all perpendiculars erected from the
earth s surface rendered inexplicable  then also commenced a struggle
between the prejudices  which for centuries had sufficed in daily
practice  and the unprecedented opinions which the testimony of the eyes
seemed to contradict 

thus  on the one hand  the falsest judgments  whether based on isolated
facts or only on appearances  always embrace some truths whose sphere 
whether large or small  affords room for a certain number of inferences 
beyond which we fall into absurdity  the ideas of st  augustine  for
example  contained the following truths  that bodies fall towards the
earth  that they fall in a straight line  that either the sun or the
earth moves  that either the sky or the earth turns  &c  these general
facts always have been true  our science has added nothing to them  but 
on the other hand  it being necessary to account for every thing  we are
obliged to seek for principles more and more comprehensive  that is why
we have had to abandon successively  first the opinion that the world
was flat  then the theory which regards it as the stationary centre of
the universe  &c 

if we pass now from physical nature to the moral world  we still find
ourselves subject to the same deceptions of appearance  to the same
influences of spontaneity and habit  but the distinguishing feature of
this second division of our knowledge is  on the one hand  the good
or the evil which we derive from our opinions  and  on the other  the
obstinacy with which we defend the prejudice which is tormenting and
killing us 

whatever theory we embrace in regard to the shape of the earth and the
cause of its weight  the physics of the globe does not suffer  and 
as for us  our social economy can derive therefrom neither profit nor
damage  but it is in us and through us that the laws of our moral nature
work  now  these laws cannot be executed without our deliberate aid 
and  consequently  unless we know them  if  then  our science of moral
laws is false  it is evident that  while desiring our own good  we are
accomplishing our own evil  if it is only incomplete  it may suffice for
a time for our social progress  but in the long run it will lead us
into a wrong road  and will finally precipitate us into an abyss of
calamities 

then it is that we need to exercise our highest judgments  and  be it
said to our glory  they are never found wanting  but then also commences
a furious struggle between old prejudices and new ideas  days of
conflagration and anguish  we are told of the time when  with the same
beliefs  with the same institutions  all the world seemed happy  why
complain of these beliefs  why banish these institutions  we are slow to
admit that that happy age served the precise purpose of developing the
principle of evil which lay dormant in society  we accuse men and gods 
the powers of earth and the forces of nature  instead of seeking the
cause of the evil in his mind and heart  man blames his masters  his
rivals  his neighbors  and himself  nations arm themselves  and slay
and exterminate each other  until equilibrium is restored by the vast
depopulation  and peace again arises from the ashes of the combatants 
so loath is humanity to touch the customs of its ancestors  and to
change the laws framed by the founders of communities  and confirmed by
the faithful observance of the ages 

 nihil motum ex antiquo probabile est   distrust all innovations  wrote
titus livius  undoubtedly it would be better were man not compelled to
change  but what  because he is born ignorant  because he exists only
on condition of gradual self instruction  must he abjure the light 
abdicate his reason  and abandon himself to fortune  perfect health is
better than convalescence  should the sick man  therefore  refuse to
be cured  reform  reform  cried  ages since  john the baptist and jesus
christ  reform  reform  cried our fathers  fifty years ago  and for a
long time to come we shall shout  reform  reform 

seeing the misery of my age  i said to myself  among the principles that
support society  there is one which it does not understand  which its
ignorance has vitiated  and which causes all the evil that exists  this
principle is the most ancient of all  for it is a characteristic of
revolutions to tear down the most modern principles  and to respect
those of long standing  now the evil by which we suffer is anterior to
all revolutions  this principle  impaired by our ignorance  is honored
and cherished  for if it were not cherished it would harm nobody  it
would be without influence 

but this principle  right in its purpose  but misunderstood  this
principle  as old as humanity  what is it  can it be religion 

all men believe in god  this dogma belongs at once to their conscience
and their mind  to humanity god is a fact as primitive  an idea as
inevitable  a principle as necessary as are the categorical ideas of
cause  substance  time  and space to our understanding  god is proven to
us by the conscience prior to any inference of the mind  just as the
sun is proven to us by the testimony of the senses prior to all the
arguments of physics  we discover phenomena and laws by observation and
experience  only this deeper sense reveals to us existence  humanity
believes that god is  but  in believing in god  what does it believe  in
a word  what is god 

the nature of this notion of divinity   this primitive  universal
notion  born in the race   the human mind has not yet fathomed  at each
step that we take in our investigation of nature and of causes  the idea
of god is extended and exalted  the farther science advances  the more
god seems to grow and broaden  anthropomorphism and idolatry constituted
of necessity the faith of the mind in its youth  the theology of infancy
and poesy  a harmless error  if they had not endeavored to make it a
rule of conduct  and if they had been wise enough to respect the
liberty of thought  but having made god in his own image  man wished
to appropriate him still farther  not satisfied with disfiguring the
almighty  he treated him as his patrimony  his goods  his possessions 
god  pictured in monstrous forms  became throughout the world the
property of man and of the state  such was the origin of the corruption
of morals by religion  and the source of pious feuds and holy wars 
thank heaven  we have learned to allow every one his own beliefs  we
seek for moral laws outside the pale of religion  instead of legislating
as to the nature and attributes of god  the dogmas of theology  and
the destiny of our souls  we wisely wait for science to tell us what to
reject and what to accept  god  soul  religion   eternal objects of
our unwearied thought and our most fatal aberrations  terrible
problems whose solution  for ever attempted  for ever remains
unaccomplished   concerning all these questions we may still be
mistaken  but at least our error is harmless  with liberty in religion 
and the separation of the spiritual from the temporal power  the
influence of religious ideas upon the progress of society is purely
negative  no law  no political or civil institution being founded on
religion  neglect of duties imposed by religion may increase the general
corruption  but it is not the primary cause  it is only an auxiliary or
result  it is universally admitted  and especially in the matter
which now engages our attention  that the cause of the inequality
of conditions among men  of pauperism  of universal misery  and of
governmental embarrassments  can no longer be traced to religion  we
must go farther back  and dig still deeper 

but what is there in man older and deeper than the religious sentiment 

there is man himself  that is  volition and conscience  free will and
law  eternally antagonistic  man is at war with himself  why 

 man   say the theologians   transgressed in the beginning  our race
is guilty of an ancient offence  for this transgression humanity has
fallen  error and ignorance have become its sustenance  read history 
you will find universal proof of this necessity for evil in the
permanent misery of nations  man suffers and always will suffer  his
disease is hereditary and constitutional  use palliatives  employ
emollients  there is no remedy  

nor is this argument peculiar to the theologians  we find it
expressed in equivalent language in the philosophical writings of the
materialists  believers in infinite perfectibility  destutt de tracy
teaches formally that poverty  crime  and war are the inevitable
conditions of our social state  necessary evils  against which it would
be folly to revolt  so  call it necessity of evil or original depravity 
it is at bottom the same philosophy 

 the first man transgressed   if the votaries of the bible interpreted
it faithfully  they would say  man originally transgressed  that is 
made a mistake  for to transgress  to fail  to make a mistake  all mean
the same thing 

 the consequences of adam s transgression are inherited by the race 
the first is ignorance   truly  the race  like the individual  is born
ignorant  but  in regard to a multitude of questions  even in the moral
and political spheres  this ignorance of the race has been dispelled 
who says that it will not depart altogether  mankind makes continual
progress toward truth  and light ever triumphs over darkness  our
disease is not  then  absolutely incurable  and the theory of the
theologians is worse than inadequate  it is ridiculous  since it is
reducible to this tautology   man errs  because he errs   while the true
statement is this   man errs  because he learns  

now  if man arrives at a knowledge of all that he needs to know  it is
reasonable to believe that  ceasing to err  he will cease to suffer 

but if we question the doctors as to this law  said to be engraved upon
the heart of man  we shall immediately see that they dispute about a
matter of which they know nothing  that  concerning the most important
questions  there are almost as many opinions as authors  that we find
no two agreeing as to the best form of government  the principle of
authority  and the nature of right  that all sail hap hazard upon a
shoreless and bottomless sea  abandoned to the guidance of their private
opinions which they modestly take to be right reason  and  in view
of this medley of contradictory opinions  we say   the object of our
investigations is the law  the determination of the social principle 
now  the politicians  that is  the social scientists  do not understand
each other  then the error lies in themselves  and  as every error has
a reality for its object  we must look in their books to find the truth
which they have unconsciously deposited there  

now  of what do the lawyers and the publicists treat  of justice 
equity  liberty  natural law  civil laws  &c  but what is justice 
what is its principle  its character  its formula  to this question our
doctors evidently have no reply  for otherwise their science  starting
with a principle clear and well defined  would quit the region of
probabilities  and all disputes would end 

what is justice  the theologians answer   all justice comes from god  
that is true  but we know no more than before 

the philosophers ought to be better informed  they have argued so much
about justice and injustice  unhappily  an examination proves that their
knowledge amounts to nothing  and that with them  as with the savages
whose every prayer to the sun is simply  o  o    it is a cry of
admiration  love  and enthusiasm  but who does not know that the sun
attaches little meaning to the interjection o  that is exactly our
position toward the philosophers in regard to justice  justice  they
say  is a daughter of heaven  a light which illumines every man that
comes into the world  the most beautiful prerogative of our nature 
that which distinguishes us from the beasts and likens us to god  and
a thousand other similar things  what  i ask  does this pious litany
amount to  to the prayer of the savages  o 

all the most reasonable teachings of human wisdom concerning justice are
summed up in that famous adage  do unto others that which you would that
others should do unto you  do not unto others that which you would
not that others should do unto you  but this rule of moral practice is
unscientific  what have i a right to wish that others should do or not
do to me  it is of no use to tell me that my duty is equal to my right 
unless i am told at the same time what my right is 

let us try to arrive at something more precise and positive 

justice is the central star which governs societies  the pole around
which the political world revolves  the principle and the regulator of
all transactions  nothing takes place between men save in the name of
right  nothing without the invocation of justice  justice is not the
work of the law  on the contrary  the law is only a declaration and
application of justice in all circumstances where men are liable to come
in contact  if  then  the idea that we form of justice and right were
ill defined  if it were imperfect or even false  it is clear that all
our legislative applications would be wrong  our institutions vicious 
our politics erroneous  consequently there would be disorder and social
chaos 

this hypothesis of the perversion of justice in our minds  and  as a
necessary result  in our acts  becomes a demonstrated fact when it is
shown that the opinions of men have not borne a constant relation to the
notion of justice and its applications  that at different periods they
have undergone modifications  in a word  that there has been progress
in ideas  now  that is what history proves by the most overwhelming
testimony 

eighteen hundred years ago  the world  under the rule of the caesars 
exhausted itself in slavery  superstition  and voluptuousness  the
people  intoxicated and  as it were  stupefied by their long continued
orgies  had lost the very notion of right and duty  war and dissipation
by turns swept them away  usury and the labor of machines  that is of
slaves   by depriving them of the means of subsistence  hindered them
from continuing the species  barbarism sprang up again  in a hideous
form  from this mass of corruption  and spread like a devouring leprosy
over the depopulated provinces  the wise foresaw the downfall of the
empire  but could devise no remedy  what could they think indeed  to
save this old society it would have been necessary to change the objects
of public esteem and veneration  and to abolish the rights affirmed by
a justice purely secular  they said   rome has conquered through her
politics and her gods  any change in theology and public opinion would
be folly and sacrilege  rome  merciful toward conquered nations  though
binding them in chains  spared their lives  slaves are the most fertile
source of her wealth  freedom of the nations would be the negation of
her rights and the ruin of her finances  rome  in fact  enveloped in the
pleasures and gorged with the spoils of the universe  is kept alive by
victory and government  her luxury and her pleasures are the price of
her conquests  she can neither abdicate nor dispossess herself  
thus rome had the facts and the law on her side  her pretensions were
justified by universal custom and the law of nations  her institutions
were based upon idolatry in religion  slavery in the state  and
epicurism in private life  to touch those was to shake society to its
foundations  and  to use our modern expression  to open the abyss of
revolutions  so the idea occurred to no one  and yet humanity was dying
in blood and luxury 

all at once a man appeared  calling himself the word of god  it is not
known to this day who he was  whence he came  nor what suggested to
him his ideas  he went about proclaiming everywhere that the end of the
existing society was at hand  that the world was about to experience a
new birth  that the priests were vipers  the lawyers ignoramuses 
and the philosophers hypocrites and liars  that master and slave
were equals  that usury and every thing akin to it was robbery  that
proprietors and idlers would one day burn  while the poor and pure in
heart would find a haven of peace 

this man  the word of god  was denounced and arrested as a public enemy
by the priests and the lawyers  who well understood how to induce the
people to demand his death  but this judicial murder  though it put the
finishing stroke to their crimes  did not destroy the doctrinal seeds
which the word of god had sown  after his death  his original disciples
travelled about in all directions  preaching what they called the good
news  creating in their turn millions of missionaries  and  when their
task seemed to be accomplished  dying by the sword of roman justice 
this persistent agitation  the war of the executioners and martyrs 
lasted nearly three centuries  ending in the conversion of the world 
idolatry was destroyed  slavery abolished  dissolution made room for a
more austere morality  and the contempt for wealth was sometimes pushed
almost to privation 

society was saved by the negation of its own principles  by a revolution
in its religion  and by violation of its most sacred rights  in this
revolution  the idea of justice spread to an extent that had not before
been dreamed of  never to return to its original limits  heretofore
justice had existed only for the masters   7  it then commenced to exist
for the slaves 

nevertheless  the new religion at that time had borne by no means all
its fruits  there was a perceptible improvement of the public morals 
and a partial release from oppression  but  other than that  the seeds
sown by the son of man  having fallen into idolatrous hearts  had
produced nothing save innumerable discords and a quasi poetical
mythology  instead of developing into their practical consequences the
principles of morality and government taught by the word of god  his
followers busied themselves in speculations as to his birth  his origin 
his person  and his actions  they discussed his parables  and from the
conflict of the most extravagant opinions upon unanswerable questions
and texts which no one understood  was born theology   which may be
defined as the science of the infinitely absurd 

the truth of christianity did not survive the age of the apostles  the
gospel  commented upon and symbolized by the greeks and latins  loaded
with pagan fables  became literally a mass of contradictions  and to
this day the reign of the infallible church has been a long era of
darkness  it is said that the gates of hell will not always prevail 
that the word of god will return  and that one day men will know truth
and justice  but that will be the death of greek and roman catholicism 
just as in the light of science disappeared the caprices of opinion 

the monsters which the successors of the apostles were bent on
destroying  frightened for a moment  reappeared gradually  thanks to the
crazy fanaticism  and sometimes the deliberate connivance  of priests
and theologians  the history of the enfranchisement of the french
communes offers constantly the spectacle of the ideas of justice and
liberty spreading among the people  in spite of the combined efforts of
kings  nobles  and clergy  in the year 1789 of the christian era  the
french nation  divided by caste  poor and oppressed  struggled in the
triple net of royal absolutism  the tyranny of nobles and parliaments 
and priestly intolerance  there was the right of the king and the right
of the priest  the right of the patrician and the right of the plebeian 
there were the privileges of birth  province  communes  corporations 
and trades  and  at the bottom of all  violence  immorality  and misery 
for some time they talked of reformation  those who apparently desired
it most favoring it only for their own profit  and the people who were
to be the gainers expecting little and saying nothing  for a long
time these poor people  either from distrust  incredulity  or despair 
hesitated to ask for their rights  it is said that the habit of serving
had taken the courage away from those old communes  which in the middle
ages were so bold 

finally a book appeared  summing up the whole matter in these two
propositions  what is the third estate   nothing  what ought it
to be   every thing  some one added by way of comment  what is the
king   the servant of the people 

this was a sudden revelation  the veil was torn aside  a thick bandage
fell from all eyes  the people commenced to reason thus   

if the king is our servant  he ought to report to us 

if he ought to report to us  he is subject to control 

if he can be controlled  he is responsible 

if he is responsible  he is punishable 

if he is punishable  he ought to be punished according to his merits 

if he ought to be punished according to his merits  he can be punished
with death 

five years after the publication of the brochure of sieyes  the third
estate was every thing  the king  the nobility  the clergy  were no
more  in 1793  the nation  without stopping at the constitutional
fiction of the inviolability of the sovereign  conducted louis xvi  to
the scaffold  in 1830  it accompanied charles x  to cherbourg  in each
case  it may have erred  in fact  in its judgment of the offence  but 
in right  the logic which led to its action was irreproachable  the
people  in punishing their sovereign  did precisely that which the
government of july was so severely censured for failing to do when it
refused to execute louis bonaparte after the affair of strasburg  they
struck the true culprit  it was an application of the common law  a
solemn decree of justice enforcing the penal laws   8 

the spirit which gave rise to the movement of  89 was a spirit of
negation  that  of itself  proves that the order of things which was
substituted for the old system was not methodical or well considered 
that  born of anger and hatred  it could not have the effect of a
science based on observation and study  that its foundations  in a word 
were not derived from a profound knowledge of the laws of nature and
society  thus the people found that the republic  among the so called
new institutions  was acting on the very principles against which they
had fought  and was swayed by all the prejudices which they had intended
to destroy  we congratulate ourselves  with inconsiderate enthusiasm 
on the glorious french revolution  the regeneration of 1789  the great
changes that have been effected  and the reversion of institutions  a
delusion  a delusion 

when our ideas on any subject  material  intellectual  or social 
undergo a thorough change in consequence of new observations  i call
that movement of the mind revolution  if the ideas are simply extended
or modified  there is only progress  thus the system of ptolemy was a
step in astronomical progress  that of copernicus was a revolution  so 
in 1789  there was struggle and progress  revolution there was none  an
examination of the reforms which were attempted proves this 

the nation  so long a victim of monarchical selfishness  thought to
deliver itself for ever by declaring that it alone was sovereign  but
what was monarchy  the sovereignty of one man  what is democracy  the
sovereignty of the nation  or  rather  of the national majority  but it
is  in both cases  the sovereignty of man instead of the sovereignty of
the law  the sovereignty of the will instead of the sovereignty of the
reason  in one word  the passions instead of justice  undoubtedly  when
a nation passes from the monarchical to the democratic state  there
is progress  because in multiplying the sovereigns we increase the
opportunities of the reason to substitute itself for the will  but in
reality there is no revolution in the government  since the principle
remains the same  now  we have the proof to day that  with the most
perfect democracy  we cannot be free   9 

nor is that all  the nation king cannot exercise its sovereignty itself 
it is obliged to delegate it to agents  this is constantly reiterated by
those who seek to win its favor  be these agents five  ten  one hundred 
or a thousand  of what consequence is the number  and what matters the
name  it is always the government of man  the rule of will and caprice 
i ask what this pretended revolution has revolutionized 

we know  too  how this sovereignty was exercised  first by the
convention  then by the directory  afterwards confiscated by the consul 
as for the emperor  the strong man so much adored and mourned by the
nation  he never wanted to be dependent on it  but  as if intending to
set its sovereignty at defiance  he dared to demand its suffrage  that
is  its abdication  the abdication of this inalienable sovereignty  and
he obtained it 

but what is sovereignty  it is  they say  the power to make law   10 
another absurdity  a relic of despotism  the nation had long seen kings
issuing their commands in this form  for such is our pleasure  it wished
to taste in its turn the pleasure of making laws  for fifty years it
has brought them forth by myriads  always  be it understood  through the
agency of representatives  the play is far from ended 

the definition of sovereignty was derived from the definition of the
law  the law  they said  is the expression of the will of the sovereign 
then  under a monarchy  the law is the expression of the will of the
king  in a republic  the law is the expression of the will of the
people  aside from the difference in the number of wills  the two
systems are exactly identical  both share the same error  namely  that
the law is the expression of a will  it ought to be the expression of
a fact  moreover they followed good leaders  they took the citizen of
geneva for their prophet  and the contrat social for their koran 

bias and prejudice are apparent in all the phrases of the new
legislators  the nation had suffered from a multitude of exclusions and
privileges  its representatives issued the following declaration  all
men are equal by nature and before the law  an ambiguous and redundant
declaration  men are equal by nature  does that mean that they are equal
in size  beauty  talents  and virtue  no  they meant  then  political
and civil equality  then it would have been sufficient to have said  all
men are equal before the law 

but what is equality before the law  neither the constitution of 1790 
nor that of  93  nor the granted charter  nor the accepted charter  have
defined it accurately  all imply an inequality in fortune and station
incompatible with even a shadow of equality in rights  in this respect
it may be said that all our constitutions have been faithful expressions
of the popular will  i am going  to prove it 

formerly the people were excluded from civil and military offices  it
was considered a wonder when the following high sounding article
was inserted in the declaration of rights   all citizens are equally
eligible to office  free nations know no qualifications in their choice
of officers save virtues and talents  

they certainly ought to have admired so beautiful an idea  they admired
a piece of nonsense  why  the sovereign people  legislators  and
reformers  see in public offices  to speak plainly  only opportunities
for pecuniary advancement  and  because it regards them as a source of
profit  it decrees the eligibility of citizens  for of what use would
this precaution be  if there were nothing to gain by it  no one would
think of ordaining that none but astronomers and geographers should be
pilots  nor of prohibiting stutterers from acting at the theatre and
the opera  the nation was still aping the kings  like them it wished
to award the lucrative positions to its friends and flatterers 
unfortunately  and this last feature completes the resemblance  the
nation did not control the list of livings  that was in the hands of its
agents and representatives  they  on the other hand  took care not to
thwart the will of their gracious sovereign 

this edifying article of the declaration of rights  retained in the
charters of 1814 and 1830  implies several kinds of civil inequality 
that is  of inequality before the law  inequality of station  since the
public functions are sought only for the consideration and emoluments
which they bring  inequality of wealth  since  if it had been desired
to equalize fortunes  public service would have been regarded as a duty 
not as a reward  inequality of privilege  the law not stating what
it means by talents and virtues  under the empire  virtue and talent
consisted simply in military bravery and devotion to the emperor  that
was shown when napoleon created his nobility  and attempted to connect
it with the ancients  to day  the man who pays taxes to the amount
of two hundred francs is virtuous  the talented man is the honest
pickpocket  such truths as these are accounted trivial 

the people finally legalized property  god forgive them  for they
knew not what they did  for fifty years they have suffered for their
miserable folly  but how came the people  whose voice  they tell us 
is the voice of god  and whose conscience is infallible   how came the
people to err  how happens it that  when seeking liberty and equality 
they fell back into privilege and slavery  always through copying the
ancient regime 

formerly  the nobility and the clergy contributed towards the expenses
of the state only by voluntary aid and gratuitous gift  their property
could not be seized even for debt   while the plebeian  overwhelmed by
taxes and statute labor  was continually tormented  now by the
king s tax gatherers  now by those of the nobles and clergy  he whose
possessions were subject to mortmain could neither bequeath nor inherit
property  he was treated like the animals  whose services and offspring
belong to their master by right of accession  the people wanted the
conditions of ownership to be alike for all  they thought that every one
should enjoy and freely dispose of his possessions his income and the
fruit of his labor and industry  the people did not invent property  but
as they had not the same privileges in regard to it  which the nobles
and clergy possessed  they decreed that the right should be exercised
by all under the same conditions  the more obnoxious forms of
property  statute labor  mortmain  maitrise  and exclusion from public
office  have disappeared  the conditions of its enjoyment have been
modified  the principle still remains the same  there has been progress
in the regulation of the right  there has been no revolution 

these  then  are the three fundamental principles of modern society 
established one after another by the movements of 1789 and 1830  1 
sovereignty of the human will  in short  despotism  2  inequality of
wealth and rank  3  property  above justice  always invoked as the
guardian angel of sovereigns  nobles  and proprietors  justice  the
general  primitive  categorical law of all society 

we must ascertain whether the ideas of despotism  civil inequality
and property  are in harmony with the primitive notion of justice  and
necessarily follow from it   assuming various forms according to the
condition  position  and relation of persons  or whether they are not
rather the illegitimate result of a confusion of different things  a
fatal association of ideas  and since justice deals especially with the
questions of government  the condition of persons  and the possession
of things  we must ascertain under what conditions  judging by universal
opinion and the progress of the human mind  government is just  the
condition of citizens is just  and the possession of things is just 
then  striking out every thing which fails to meet these conditions 
the result will at once tell us what legitimate government is  what the
legitimate condition of citizens is  and what the legitimate possession
of things is  and finally  as the last result of the analysis  what
justice is 

is the authority of man over man just 

everybody answers   no  the authority of man is only the authority of
the law  which ought to be justice and truth   the private will counts
for nothing in government  which consists  first  in discovering truth
and justice in order to make the law  and  second  in superintending the
execution of this law  i do not now inquire whether our constitutional
form of government satisfies these conditions  whether  for example  the
will of the ministry never influences the declaration and interpretation
of the law  or whether our deputies  in their debates  are more intent
on conquering by argument than by force of numbers  it is enough for me
that my definition of a good government is allowed to be correct  this
idea is exact  yet we see that nothing seems more just to the oriental
nations than the despotism of their sovereigns  that  with the ancients
and in the opinion of the philosophers themselves  slavery was just 
that in the middle ages the nobles  the priests  and the bishops felt
justified in holding slaves  that louis xiv  thought that he was right
when he said   the state  i am the state   and that napoleon deemed it
a crime for the state to oppose his will  the idea of justice  then 
applied to sovereignty and government  has not always been what it is
to day  it has gone on developing and shaping itself by degrees  until
it has arrived at its present state  but has it reached its last phase 
i think not  only  as the last obstacle to be overcome arises from the
institution of property which we have kept intact  in order to finish
the reform in government and consummate the revolution  this very
institution we must attack 

is political and civil inequality just 

some say yes  others no  to the first i would reply that  when the
people abolished all privileges of birth and caste  they did it  in all
probability  because it was for their advantage  why then do they favor
the privileges of fortune more than those of rank and race  because  say
they  political inequality is a result of property  and without property
society is impossible  thus the question just raised becomes a question
of property  to the second i content myself with this remark  if you
wish to enjoy political equality  abolish property  otherwise  why do
you complain 

is property just 

everybody answers without hesitation   yes  property is just   i say
everybody  for up to the present time no one who thoroughly understood
the meaning of his words has answered no  for it is no easy thing to
reply understandingly to such a question  only time and experience can
furnish an answer  now  this answer is given  it is for us to understand
it  i undertake to prove it 

we are to proceed with the demonstration in the following order   

i  we dispute not at all  we refute nobody  we deny nothing  we accept
as sound all the arguments alleged in favor of property  and confine
ourselves to a search for its principle  in order that we may then
ascertain whether this principle is faithfully expressed by property  in
fact  property being defensible on no ground save that of justice  the
idea  or at least the intention  of justice must of necessity underlie
all the arguments that have been made in defence of property  and  as on
the other hand the right of property is only exercised over those things
which can be appreciated by the senses  justice  secretly objectifying
itself  so to speak  must take the shape of an algebraic formula 

by this method of investigation  we soon see that every argument which
has been invented in behalf of property  whatever it may be  always and
of necessity leads to equality  that is  to the negation of property 

the first part covers two chapters  one treating of occupation  the
foundation of our right  the other  of labor and talent  considered as
causes of property and social inequality 

the first of these chapters will prove that the right of occupation
obstructs property  the second that the right of labor destroys it 

ii  property  then  being of necessity conceived as existing only in
connection with equality  it remains to find out why  in spite of this
necessity of logic  equality does not exist  this new investigation also
covers two chapters  in the first  considering the fact of property in
itself  we inquire whether this fact is real  whether it exists  whether
it is possible  for it would imply a contradiction  were these two
opposite forms of society  equality and inequality  both possible  then
we discover  singularly enough  that property may indeed manifest
itself accidentally  but that  as an institution and principle  it is
mathematically impossible  so that the axiom of the school  ab actu ad
posse valet consecutio  from the actual to the possible the inference is
good  is given the lie as far as property is concerned 

finally  in the last chapter  calling psychology to our aid  and
probing man s nature to the bottom  we shall disclose the principle of
justice  its formula and character  we shall state with precision the
organic law of society  we shall explain the origin of property  the
causes of its establishment  its long life  and its approaching death 
we shall definitively establish its identity with robbery  and  after
having shown that these three prejudices  the sovereignty of man  the
inequality of conditions  and property  are one and the same  that they
may be taken for each other  and are reciprocally convertible   we
shall have no trouble in inferring therefrom  by the principle
of contradiction  the basis of government and right  there our
investigations will end  reserving the right to continue them in future
works 

the importance of the subject which engages our attention is recognized
by all minds 


 property   says m  hennequin   is the creative and conservative
principle of civil society  property is one of those basic institutions 
new theories concerning which cannot be presented too soon  for it must
not be forgotten  and the publicist and statesman must know  that on the
answer to the question whether property is the principle or the result
of social order  whether it is to be considered as a cause or an effect 
depends all morality  and  consequently  all the authority of human
institutions  


these words are a challenge to all men of hope and faith  but  although
the cause of equality is a noble one  no one has yet picked up the
gauntlet thrown down by the advocates of property  no one has been
courageous enough to enter upon the struggle  the spurious learning of
haughty jurisprudence  and the absurd aphorisms of a political economy
controlled by property have puzzled the most generous minds  it is a
sort of password among the most influential friends of liberty and
the interests of the people that equality is a chimera  so many false
theories and meaningless analogies influence minds otherwise keen 
but which are unconsciously controlled by popular prejudice  equality
advances every day  fit aequalitas  soldiers of liberty  shall we desert
our flag in the hour of triumph 

a defender of equality  i shall speak without bitterness and without
anger  with the independence becoming a philosopher  with the courage
and firmness of a free man  may i  in this momentous struggle  carry
into all hearts the light with which i am filled  and show  by the
success of my argument  that equality failed to conquer by the sword
only that it might conquer by the pen 




chapter ii  property considered as a natural right

     property considered as a natural right   occupation and
     civil law as efficient bases of property  definitions 

the roman law defined property as the right to use and abuse one s own
within the limits of the law  jus utendi et abutendi re sua  quatenus
juris ratio patitur  a justification of the word abuse has been
attempted  on the ground that it signifies  not senseless and immoral
abuse  but only absolute domain  vain distinction  invented as an excuse
for property  and powerless against the frenzy of possession  which it
neither prevents nor represses  the proprietor may  if he chooses  allow
his crops to rot under foot  sow his field with salt  milk his cows
on the sand  change his vineyard into a desert  and use his
vegetable garden as a park  do these things constitute abuse  or not  in
the matter of property  use and abuse are necessarily indistinguishable 

according to the declaration of rights  published as a preface to the
constitution of  93  property is  the right to enjoy and dispose at
will of one s goods  one s income  and the fruit of one s labor and
industry  

code napoleon  article 544   property is the right to enjoy and dispose
of things in the most absolute manner  provided we do not overstep the
limits prescribed by the laws and regulations  

these two definitions do not differ from that of the roman law  all
give the proprietor an absolute right over a thing  and as for the
restriction imposed by the code   provided we do not overstep the limits
prescribed by the laws and regulations   its object is not to limit
property  but to prevent the domain of one proprietor from interfering
with that of another  that is a confirmation of the principle  not a
limitation of it 

there are different kinds of property  1  property pure and simple  the
dominant and seigniorial power over a thing  or  as they term it  naked
property  2  possession   possession   says duranton   is a matter of
fact  not of right   toullier   property is a right  a legal power 
possession is a fact   the tenant  the farmer  the commandite  the
usufructuary  are possessors  the owner who lets and lends for use  the
heir who is to come into possession on the death of a usufructuary  are
proprietors  if i may venture the comparison  a lover is a possessor  a
husband is a proprietor 

this double definition of property  domain and possession  is of the
highest importance  and it must be clearly understood  in order to
comprehend what is to follow 

from the distinction between possession and property arise two sorts of
rights  the jus in re  the right in a thing  the right by which i may
reclaim the property which i have acquired  in whatever hands i find
it  and the jus ad rem  the right to a thing  which gives me a claim to
become a proprietor  thus the right of the partners to a marriage over
each other s person is the jus in re  that of two who are betrothed is
only the jus ad rem  in the first  possession and property are united 
the second includes only naked property  with me who  as a laborer 
have a right to the possession of the products of nature and my own
industry   and who  as a proletaire  enjoy none of them   it is by
virtue of the jus ad rem that i demand admittance to the jus in re 

this distinction between the jus in re and the jus ad rem is the basis
of the famous distinction between possessoire and petitoire   actual
categories of jurisprudence  the whole of which is included within their
vast boundaries  petitoire refers to every thing relating to property 
possessoire to that relating to possession  in writing this memoir
against property  i bring against universal society an action petitoire 
i prove that those who do not possess to day are proprietors by the same
title as those who do possess  but  instead of inferring therefrom
that property should be shared by all  i demand  in the name of general
security  its entire abolition  if i fail to win my case  there is
nothing left for us  the proletarian class and myself  but to cut our
throats  we can ask nothing more from the justice of nations  for  as
the code of procedure  art 26  tells us in its energetic style  the
plaintiff who has been non suited in an action petitoire  is debarred
thereby from bringing an action possessoire  if  on the contrary  i gain
the case  we must then commence an action possessoire  that we may be
reinstated in the enjoyment of the wealth of which we are deprived by
property  i hope that we shall not be forced to that extremity  but
these two actions cannot be prosecuted at once  such a course being
prohibited by the same code of procedure 

before going to the heart of the question  it will not be useless to
offer a few preliminary remarks 

  1   property as a natural right 

the declaration of rights has placed property in its list of the natural
and inalienable rights of man  four in all  liberty  equality  property 
security  what rule did the legislators of  93 follow in compiling
this list  none  they laid down principles  just as they discussed
sovereignty and the laws  from a general point of view  and according to
their own opinion  they did every thing in their own blind way 

if we can believe toullier   the absolute rights can be reduced to
three  security  liberty  property   equality is eliminated by the
rennes professor  why  is it because liberty implies it  or because
property prohibits it  on this point the author of  droit civil
explique  is silent  it has not even occurred to him that the matter is
under discussion 

nevertheless  if we compare these three or four rights with each other 
we find that property bears no resemblance whatever to the others 
that for the majority of citizens it exists only potentially  and as a
dormant faculty without exercise  that for the others  who do enjoy it 
it is susceptible of certain transactions and modifications which do
not harmonize with the idea of a natural right  that  in practice 
governments  tribunals  and laws do not respect it  and finally that
everybody  spontaneously and with one voice  regards it as chimerical 

liberty is inviolable  i can neither sell nor alienate my liberty 
every contract  every condition of a contract  which has in view the
alienation or suspension of liberty  is null  the slave  when he plants
his foot upon the soil of liberty  at that moment becomes a free man 
when society seizes a malefactor and deprives him of his liberty  it is
a case of legitimate defence  whoever violates the social compact by the
commission of a crime declares himself a public enemy  in attacking the
liberty of others  he compels them to take away his own  liberty is the
original condition of man  to renounce liberty is to renounce the nature
of man  after that  how could we perform the acts of man 

likewise  equality before the law suffers neither restriction nor
exception  all frenchmen are equally eligible to office  consequently 
in the presence of this equality  condition and family have  in many
cases  no influence upon choice  the poorest citizen can obtain judgment
in the courts against one occupying the most exalted station  let the
millionaire  ahab  build a chateau upon the vineyard of naboth  the
court will have the power  according to the circumstances  to order the
destruction of the chateau  though it has cost millions  and to force
the trespasser to restore the vineyard to its original state  and pay
the damages  the law wishes all property  that has been legitimately
acquired  to be kept inviolate without regard to value  and without
respect for persons 

the charter demands  it is true  for the exercise of certain political
rights  certain conditions of fortune and capacity  but all publicists
know that the legislator s intention was not to establish a privilege 
but to take security  provided the conditions fixed by law are complied
with  every citizen may be an elector  and every elector eligible  the
right  once acquired  is the same for all  the law compares neither
persons nor votes  i do not ask now whether this system is the best  it
is enough that  in the opinion of the charter and in the eyes of every
one  equality before the law is absolute  and  like liberty  admits of
no compromise 

it is the same with the right of security  society promises its members
no half way protection  no sham defence  it binds itself to them as
they bind themselves to it  it does not say to them   i will shield
you  provided it costs me nothing  i will protect you  if i run no risks
thereby   it says   i will defend you against everybody  i will save and
avenge you  or perish myself  

the whole strength of the state is at the service of each citizen  the
obligation which binds them together is absolute 

how different with property  worshipped by all  it is acknowledged by
none  laws  morals  customs  public and private conscience  all plot its
death and ruin 

to meet the expenses of government  which has armies to support  tasks
to perform  and officers to pay  taxes are needed  let all contribute to
these expenses  nothing more just  but why should the rich pay more than
the poor  that is just  they say  because they possess more  i confess
that such justice is beyond my comprehension 

why are taxes paid  to protect all in the exercise of their natural
rights  liberty  equality  security  and property  to maintain order in
the state  to furnish the public with useful and pleasant conveniences 

now  does it cost more to defend the rich man s life and liberty than
the poor man s  who  in time of invasion  famine  or plague  causes
more trouble   the large proprietor who escapes the evil without
the assistance of the state  or the laborer who sits in his cottage
unprotected from danger 

is public order endangered more by the worthy citizen  or by the artisan
and journeyman  why  the police have more to fear from a few hundred
laborers  out of work  than from two hundred thousand electors 

does the man of large income appreciate more keenly than the poor man
national festivities  clean streets  and beautiful monuments 

why  he prefers his country seat to all the popular pleasures  and when
he wants to enjoy himself  he does not wait for the greased pole 

one of two things is true  either the proportional tax affords greater
security to the larger tax payers  or else it is a wrong 

because  if property is a natural right  as the declaration of  93
declares  all that belongs to me by virtue of this right is as sacred as
my person  it is my blood  my life  myself  whoever touches it offends
the apple of my eye  my income of one hundred thousand francs is as
inviolable as the grisette s daily wage of seventy five centimes  her
attic is no more sacred than my suite of apartments  the tax is not
levied in proportion to strength  size  or skill  no more should it be
levied in proportion to property 

if  then  the state takes more from me  let it give me more in return 
or cease to talk of equality of rights  for otherwise  society is
established  not to defend property  but to destroy it  the state 
through the proportional tax  becomes the chief of robbers  the state
sets the example of systematic pillage  the state should be brought to
the bar of justice at the head of those hideous brigands  that execrable
mob which it now kills from motives of professional jealousy 

but  they say  the courts and the police force are established to
restrain this mob  government is a company  not exactly for insurance 
for it does not insure  but for vengeance and repression  the premium
which this company exacts  the tax  is divided in proportion to
property  that is  in proportion to the trouble which each piece of
property occasions the avengers and repressers paid by the government 

this is any thing but the absolute and inalienable right of property 
under this system the poor and the rich distrust  and make war upon 
each other  but what is the object of the war  property  so that
property is necessarily accompanied by war upon property  the liberty
and security of the rich do not suffer from the liberty and security
of the poor  far from that  they mutually strengthen and sustain each
other  the rich man s right of property  on the contrary  has to be
continually defended against the poor man s desire for property  what
a contradiction  in england they have a poor rate  they wish me to pay
this tax  but what relation exists between my natural and inalienable
right of property and the hunger from which ten million wretched people
are suffering  when religion commands us to assist our fellows  it
speaks in the name of charity  not in the name of law  the obligation
of benevolence  imposed upon me by christian morality  cannot be imposed
upon me as a political tax for the benefit of any person or poor house 
i will give alms when i see fit to do so  when the sufferings of others
excite in me that sympathy of which philosophers talk  and in which i do
not believe  i will not be forced to bestow them  no one is obliged to
do more than comply with this injunction  in the exercise of your own
rights do not encroach upon the rights of another  an injunction which
is the exact definition of liberty  now  my possessions are my own 
no one has a claim upon them  i object to the placing of the third
theological virtue in the order of the day 

everybody  in france  demands the conversion of the five per cent 
bonds  they demand thereby the complete sacrifice of one species of
property  they have the right to do it  if public necessity requires it 
but where is the just indemnity promised by the charter  not only
does none exist  but this indemnity is not even possible  for  if the
indemnity were equal to the property sacrificed  the conversion would be
useless 

the state occupies the same position to day toward the bondholders
that the city of calais did  when besieged by edward iii  toward its
notables  the english conqueror consented to spare its inhabitants 
provided it would surrender to him its most distinguished citizens to do
with as he pleased  eustache and several others offered themselves  it
was noble in them  and our ministers should recommend their example to
the bondholders  but had the city the right to surrender them  assuredly
not  the right to security is absolute  the country can require no one
to sacrifice himself  the soldier standing guard within the enemy s
range is no exception to this rule  wherever a citizen stands guard 
the country stands guard with him  to day it is the turn of the one 
to morrow of the other  when danger and devotion are common  flight is
parricide  no one has the right to flee from danger  no one can serve
as a scapegoat  the maxim of caiaphas  it is right that a man should die
for his nation  is that of the populace and of tyrants  the two extremes
of social degradation 

it is said that all perpetual annuities are essentially redeemable  this
maxim of civil law  applied to the state  is good for those who wish to
return to the natural equality of labor and wealth  but  from the point
of view of the proprietor  and in the mouth of conversionists  it is
the language of bankrupts  the state is not only a borrower  it is an
insurer and guardian of property  granting the best of security  it
assures the most inviolable possession  how  then  can it force open the
hands of its creditors  who have confidence in it  and then talk to
them of public order and security of property  the state  in such
an operation  is not a debtor who discharges his debt  it is a
stock company which allures its stockholders into a trap  and there 
contrary to its authentic promise  exacts from them twenty  thirty  or
forty per cent  of the interest on their capital 

that is not all  the state is a university of citizens joined together
under a common law by an act of society  this act secures all in the
possession of their property  guarantees to one his field  to another
his vineyard  to a third his rents  and to the bondholder  who might
have bought real estate but who preferred to come to the assistance of
the treasury  his bonds  the state cannot demand  without offering an
equivalent  the sacrifice of an acre of the field or a corner of the
vineyard  still less can it lower rents  why should it have the right
to diminish the interest on bonds  this right could not justly exist 
unless the bondholder could invest his funds elsewhere to equal
advantage  but being confined to the state  where can he find a place to
invest them  since the cause of conversion  that is  the power to borrow
to better advantage  lies in the state  that is why a government  based
on the principle of property  cannot redeem its annuities without the
consent of their holders 

the money deposited with the republic is property which it has no right
to touch while other kinds of property are respected  to force
their redemption is to violate the social contract  and outlaw the
bondholders 

the whole controversy as to the conversion of bonds finally reduces
itself to this   

question  is it just to reduce to misery forty five thousand families
who derive an income from their bonds of one hundred francs or less 

answer  is it just to compel seven or eight millions of tax payers to
pay a tax of five francs  when they should pay only three  it is clear 
in the first place  that the reply is in reality no reply  but  to make
the wrong more apparent  let us change it thus  is it just to endanger
the lives of one hundred thousand men  when we can save them by
surrendering one hundred heads to the enemy  reader  decide 

all this is clearly understood by the defenders of the present system 
yet  nevertheless  sooner or later  the conversion will be effected
and property be violated  because no other course is possible  because
property  regarded as a right  and not being a right  must of right
perish  because the force of events  the laws of conscience  and
physical and mathematical necessity must  in the end  destroy this
illusion of our minds 

to sum up  liberty is an absolute right  because it is to man what
impenetrability is to matter   a sine qua non of existence  equality
is an absolute right  because without equality there is no society 
security is an absolute right  because in the eyes of every man his own
liberty and life are as precious as another s  these three rights are
absolute  that is  susceptible of neither increase nor diminution 
because in society each associate receives as much as he gives   liberty
for liberty  equality for equality  security for security  body for
body  soul for soul  in life and in death 

but property  in its derivative sense  and by the definitions of law  is
a right outside of society  for it is clear that  if the wealth of each
was social wealth  the conditions would be equal for all  and it would
be a contradiction to say  property is a man s right to dispose at will
of social property  then if we are associated for the sake of liberty 
equality  and security  we are not associated for the sake of property 
then if property is a natural right  this natural right is not social 
but anti social  property and society are utterly irreconcilable
institutions  it is as impossible to associate two proprietors as to
join two magnets by their opposite poles  either society must perish  or
it must destroy property 

if property is a natural  absolute  imprescriptible  and inalienable
right  why  in all ages  has there been so much speculation as to its
origin   for this is one of its distinguishing characteristics  the
origin of a natural right  good god  who ever inquired into the origin
of the rights of liberty  security  or equality  they exist by the same
right that we exist  they are born with us  they live and die with us 
with property it is very different  indeed  by law  property can exist
without a proprietor  like a quality without a subject  it exists for
the human being who as yet is not  and for the octogenarian who is no
more  and yet  in spite of these wonderful prerogatives which savor
of the eternal and the infinite  they have never found the origin of
property  the doctors still disagree  on one point only are they in
harmony  namely  that the validity of the right of property depends upon
the authenticity of its origin  but this harmony is their condemnation 
why have they acknowledged the right before settling the question of
origin 

certain classes do not relish investigation into the pretended titles to
property  and its fabulous and perhaps scandalous history  they wish to
hold to this proposition  that property is a fact  that it always has
been  and always will be  with that proposition the savant proudhon  11 
commenced his  treatise on the right of usufruct   regarding the origin
of property as a useless question  perhaps i would subscribe to this
doctrine  believing it inspired by a commendable love of peace  were
all my fellow citizens in comfortable circumstances  but  no  i will not
subscribe to it 

the titles on which they pretend to base the right of property are two
in number  occupation and labor  i shall examine them successively 
under all their aspects and in detail  and i remind the reader that 
to whatever authority we appeal  i shall prove beyond a doubt that
property  to be just and possible  must necessarily have equality for
its condition 


  2   occupation  as the title to property 

it is remarkable that  at those meetings of the state council at which
the code was discussed  no controversy arose as to the origin and
principle of property  all the articles of vol  ii   book 2  concerning
property and the right of accession  were passed without opposition or
amendment  bonaparte  who on other questions had given his legists so
much trouble  had nothing to say about property  be not surprised at it 
in the eyes of that man  the most selfish and wilful person that ever
lived  property was the first of rights  just as submission to authority
was the most holy of duties 

the right of occupation  or of the first occupant  is that which results
from the actual  physical  real possession of a thing  i occupy a
piece of land  the presumption is  that i am the proprietor  until
the contrary is proved  we know that originally such a right cannot be
legitimate unless it is reciprocal  the jurists say as much 

cicero compares the earth to a vast theatre   quemadmodum theatrum cum
commune sit  recte tamen dici potest ejus esse eum locum quem quisque
occuparit  

this passage is all that ancient philosophy has to say about the origin
of property 

the theatre  says cicero  is common to all  nevertheless  the place that
each one occupies is called his own  that is  it is a place possessed 
not a place appropriated  this comparison annihilates property 
moreover  it implies equality  can i  in a theatre  occupy at the same
time one place in the pit  another in the boxes  and a third in the
gallery  not unless i have three bodies  like geryon  or can exist
in different places at the same time  as is related of the magician
apollonius 

according to cicero  no one has a right to more than he needs  such
is the true interpretation of his famous axiom   suum quidque cujusque
sit   to each one that which belongs to him  an axiom that has been
strangely applied  that which belongs to each is not that which each may
possess  but that which each has a right to possess  now  what have we a
right to possess  that which is required for our labor and consumption 
cicero s comparison of the earth to a theatre proves it  according to
that  each one may take what place he will  may beautify and adorn it 
if he can  it is allowable  but he must never allow himself to overstep
the limit which separates him from another  the doctrine of cicero leads
directly to equality  for  occupation being pure toleration  if the
toleration is mutual  and it cannot be otherwise  the possessions are
equal 

grotius rushes into history  but what kind of reasoning is that which
seeks the origin of a right  said to be natural  elsewhere than in
nature  this is the method of the ancients  the fact exists  then it
is necessary  then it is just  then its antecedents are just also 
nevertheless  let us look into it 

 originally  all things were common and undivided  they were the
property of all   let us go no farther  grotius tells us how this
original communism came to an end through ambition and cupidity  how the
age of gold was followed by the age of iron  &c  so that property rested
first on war and conquest  then on treaties and agreements  but either
these treaties and agreements distributed wealth equally  as did the
original communism  the only method of distribution with which the
barbarians were acquainted  and the only form of justice of which they
could conceive  and then the question of origin assumes this form 
how did equality afterwards disappear    or else these treaties and
agreements were forced by the strong upon the weak  and in that case
they are null  the tacit consent of posterity does not make them valid 
and we live in a permanent condition of iniquity and fraud 

we never can conceive how the equality of conditions  having once
existed  could afterwards have passed away  what was the cause of such
degeneration  the instincts of the animals are unchangeable  as well
as the differences of species  to suppose original equality in human
society is to admit by implication that the present inequality is
a degeneration from the nature of this society   a thing which the
defenders of property cannot explain  but i infer therefrom that  if
providence placed the first human beings in a condition of equality  it
was an indication of its desires  a model that it wished them to realize
in other forms  just as the religious sentiment  which it planted in
their hearts  has developed and manifested itself in various ways  man
has but one nature  constant and unalterable  he pursues it through
instinct  he wanders from it through reflection  he returns to it
through judgment  who shall say that we are not returning now  according
to grotius  man has abandoned equality  according to me  he will yet
return to it  how came he to abandon it  why will he return to it  these
are questions for future consideration 

reid writes as follows   

 the right of property is not innate  but acquired  it is not grounded
upon the constitution of man  but upon his actions  writers on
jurisprudence have explained its origin in a manner that may satisfy
every man of common understanding 

 the earth is given to men in common for the purposes of life  by the
bounty of heaven  but to divide it  and appropriate one part of its
produce to one  another part to another  must be the work of men
who have power and understanding given them  by which every man may
accommodate himself  without hurt to any other 

 this common right of every man to what the earth produces  before it
be occupied and appropriated by others  was  by ancient moralists  very
properly compared to the right which every citizen had to the public
theatre  where every man that came might occupy an empty seat  and
thereby acquire a right to it while the entertainment lasted  but no man
had a right to dispossess another 

 the earth is a great theatre  furnished by the almighty  with perfect
wisdom and goodness  for the entertainment and employment of all
mankind  here every man has a right to accommodate himself as a
spectator  and to perform his part as an actor  but without hurt to
others  


consequences of reid s doctrine 

1  that the portion which each one appropriates may wrong no one  it
must be equal to the quotient of the total amount of property to be
shared  divided by the number of those who are to share it 

2  the number of places being of necessity equal at all times to that
of the spectators  no spectator can occupy two places  nor can any actor
play several parts 

3  whenever a spectator comes in or goes out  the places of all contract
or enlarge correspondingly  for  says reid   the right of property
is not innate  but acquired   consequently  it is not absolute 
consequently  the occupancy on which it is based  being a conditional
fact  cannot endow this right with a stability which it does not possess
itself  this seems to have been the thought of the edinburgh professor
when he added   


 a right to life implies a right to the necessary means of life  and
that justice  which forbids the taking away the life of an innocent man 
forbids no less the taking from him the necessary means of life  he has
the same right to defend the one as the other  to hinder another man s
innocent labor  or to deprive him of the fruit of it  is an injustice
of the same kind  and has the same effect as to put him in fetters or in
prison  and is equally a just object of resentment  


thus the chief of the scotch school  without considering at all the
inequality of skill or labor  posits a priori the equality of the means
of labor  abandoning thereafter to each laborer the care of his own
person  after the eternal axiom  whoso does well  shall fare well 

the philosopher reid is lacking  not in knowledge of the principle  but
in courage to pursue it to its ultimate  if the right of life is equal 
the right of labor is equal  and so is the right of occupancy  would
it not be criminal  were some islanders to repulse  in the name of
property  the unfortunate victims of a shipwreck struggling to reach
the shore  the very idea of such cruelty sickens the imagination  the
proprietor  like robinson crusoe on his island  wards off with pike and
musket the proletaire washed overboard by the wave of civilization  and
seeking to gain a foothold upon the rocks of property   give me work  
cries he with all his might to the proprietor   don t drive me away  i
will work for you at any price    i do not need your services   replies
the proprietor  showing the end of his pike or the barrel of his gun 
 lower my rent at least    i need my income to live upon    how can
i pay you  when i can get no work    that is your business   then the
unfortunate proletaire abandons himself to the waves  or  if he attempts
to land upon the shore of property  the proprietor takes aim  and kills
him 

we have just listened to a spiritualist  we will now question a
materialist  then an eclectic  and having completed the circle of
philosophy  we will turn next to law 

according to destutt de tracy  property is a necessity of our nature 
that this necessity involves unpleasant consequences  it would be
folly to deny  but these consequences are necessary evils which do not
invalidate the principle  so that it is as unreasonable to rebel against
property on account of the abuses which it generates  as to complain
of life because it is sure to end in death  this brutal and pitiless
philosophy promises at least frank and close reasoning  let us see if it
keeps its promise 


 we talk very gravely about the conditions of property     as if it was
our province to decide what constitutes property     it would seem  to
hear certain philosophers and legislators  that at a certain moment 
spontaneously and without cause  people began to use the words thine and
mine  and that they might have  or ought to have  dispensed with them 
but thine and mine were never invented  


a philosopher yourself  you are too realistic  thine and mine do not
necessarily refer to self  as they do when i say your philosophy  and my
equality  for your philosophy is you philosophizing  and my equality is
i professing equality  thine and mine oftener indicate a relation   your
country  your parish  your tailor  your milkmaid  my chamber  my seat at
the theatre  my company and my battalion in the national guard  in the
former sense  we may sometimes say my labor  my skill  my virtue  never
my grandeur nor my majesty  in the latter sense only  my field  my
house  my vineyard  my capital   precisely as the banker s clerk says
my cash box  in short  thine and mine are signs and expressions of
personal  but equal  rights  applied to things outside of us  they
indicate possession  function  use  not property 

it does not seem possible  but  nevertheless  i shall prove  by
quotations  that the whole theory of our author is based upon this
paltry equivocation 


 prior to all covenants  men are  not exactly  as hobbes says  in a
state of hostility  but of estrangement  in this state  justice and
injustice are unknown  the rights of one bear no relation to the rights
of another  all have as many rights as needs  and all feel it their duty
to satisfy those needs by any means at their command  


grant it  whether true or false  it matters not  destutt de tracy cannot
escape equality  on this theory  men  while in a state of estrangement 
are under no obligations to each other  they all have the right
to satisfy their needs without regard to the needs of others  and
consequently the right to exercise their power over nature  each
according to his strength and ability  that involves the greatest
inequality of wealth  inequality of conditions  then  is the
characteristic feature of estrangement or barbarism  the exact opposite
of rousseau s idea 

but let us look farther   


 restrictions of these rights and this duty commence at the time when
covenants  either implied or expressed  are agreed upon  then appears
for the first time justice and injustice  that is  the balance between
the rights of one and the rights of another  which up to that time were
necessarily equal  

listen  rights were equal  that means that each individual had the right
to satisfy his needs without reference to the needs of others  in other
words  that all had the right to injure each other  that there was no
right save force and cunning  they injured each other  not only by war
and pillage  but also by usurpation and appropriation  now  in order to
abolish this equal right to use force and stratagem   this equal
right to do evil  the sole source of the inequality of benefits and
injuries   they commenced to make covenants either implied or expressed 
and established a balance  then these agreements and this balance
were intended to secure to all equal comfort  then  by the law of
contradictions  if isolation is the principle of inequality  society
must produce equality  the social balance is the equalization of the
strong and the weak  for  while they are not equals  they are strangers 
they can form no associations   they live as enemies  then  if
inequality of conditions is a necessary evil  so is isolation  for
society and inequality are incompatible with each other  then  if
society is the true condition of man s existence  so is equality also 
this conclusion cannot be avoided 

this being so  how is it that  ever since the establishment of this
balance  inequality has been on the increase  how is it that justice and
isolation always accompany each other  destutt de tracy shall reply   


 needs and means  rights and duties  are products of the will  if man
willed nothing  these would not exist  but to have needs and means 
rights and duties  is to have  to possess  something  they are so many
kinds of property  using the word in its most general sense  they are
things which belong to us  


shameful equivocation  not justified by the necessity for
generalization  the word property has two meanings  1  it designates the
quality which makes a thing what it is  the attribute which is peculiar
to it  and especially distinguishes it  we use it in this sense when we
say the properties of the triangle or of numbers  the property of the
magnet  &c  2  it expresses the right of absolute control over a thing
by a free and intelligent being  it is used in this sense by writers
on jurisprudence  thus  in the phrase  iron acquires the property of a
magnet  the word property does not convey the same idea that it does in
this one   i have acquired this magnet as my property   to tell a poor
man that he has property because he has arms and legs   that the hunger
from which he suffers  and his power to sleep in the open air are his
property   is to play upon words  and to add insult to injury 


 the sole basis of the idea of property is the idea of personality  as
soon as property is born at all  it is born  of necessity  in all its
fulness  as soon as an individual knows himself   his moral personality 
his capacities of enjoyment  suffering  and action   he necessarily
sees also that this self is exclusive proprietor of the body in which
it dwells  its organs  their powers  faculties  &c     inasmuch as
artificial and conventional property exists  there must be natural
property also  for nothing can exist in art without its counterpart in
nature  


we ought to admire the honesty and judgment of philosophers  man has
properties  that is  in the first acceptation of the term  faculties  he
has property  that is  in its second acceptation  the right of domain 
he has  then  the property of the property of being proprietor  how
ashamed i should be to notice such foolishness  were i here considering
only the authority of destutt de tracy  but the entire human race  since
the origination of society and language  when metaphysics and dialectics
were first born  has been guilty of this puerile confusion of thought 
all which man could call his own was identified in his mind with his
person  he considered it as his property  his wealth  a part of himself 
a member of his body  a faculty of his mind  the possession of things
was likened to property in the powers of the body and mind  and on this
false analogy was based the right of property   the imitation of nature
by art  as destutt de tracy so elegantly puts it 

but why did not this ideologist perceive that man is not proprietor even
of his own faculties  man has powers  attributes  capacities  they are
given him by nature that he may live  learn  and love  he does not own
them  but has only the use of them  and he can make no use of them that
does not harmonize with nature s laws  if he had absolute mastery over
his faculties  he could avoid hunger and cold  he could eat unstintedly 
and walk through fire  he could move mountains  walk a hundred leagues
in a minute  cure without medicines and by the sole force of his will 
and could make himself immortal  he could say   i wish to produce   and
his tasks would be finished with the words  he could say   i wish to
know   and he would know   i love   and he would enjoy  what then  man
is not master of himself  but may be of his surroundings  let him use
the wealth of nature  since he can live only by its use  but let him
abandon his pretensions to the title of proprietor  and remember that he
is called so only metaphorically 

to sum up  destutt de tracy classes together the external productions of
nature and art  and the powers or faculties of man  making both of them
species of property  and upon this equivocation he hopes to establish 
so firmly that it can never be disturbed  the right of property  but
of these different kinds of property some are innate  as memory 
imagination  strength  and beauty  while others are acquired  as land 
water  and forests  in the state of nature or isolation  the strongest
and most skilful  that is  those best provided with innate property 
stand the best chance of obtaining acquired property  now  it is to
prevent this encroachment and the war which results therefrom  that
a balance  justice  has been employed  and covenants  implied or
expressed  agreed upon  it is to correct  as far as possible  inequality
of innate property by equality of acquired property  as long as the
division remains unequal  so long the partners remain enemies  and it
is the purpose of the covenants to reform this state of things  thus
we have  on the one hand  isolation  inequality  enmity  war  robbery 
murder  on the other  society  equality  fraternity  peace  and love 
choose between them 

m  joseph dutens  a physician  engineer  and geometrician  but a very
poor legist  and no philosopher at all  is the author of a  philosophy
of political economy   in which he felt it his duty to break lances in
behalf of property  his reasoning seems to be borrowed from destutt
de tracy  he commences with this definition of property  worthy of
sganarelle   property is the right by which a thing is one s own  
literally translated  property is the right of property 

after getting entangled a few times on the subjects of will  liberty 
and personality  after having distinguished between immaterial natural
property  and material natural property  a distinction similar to
destutt de tracy s of innate and acquired property   m  joseph dutens
concludes with these two general propositions  1  property is a natural
and inalienable right of every man  2  inequality of property is a
necessary result of nature   which propositions are convertible into a
simpler one  all men have an equal right of unequal property 

he rebukes m  de sismondi for having taught that landed property has no
other basis than law and conventionality  and he says himself  speaking
of the respect which people feel for property  that  their good sense
reveals to them the nature of the original contract made between society
and proprietors  

he confounds property with possession  communism with equality  the just
with the natural  and the natural with the possible  now he takes these
different ideas to be equivalents  now he seems to distinguish between
them  so much so that it would be infinitely easier to refute him than
to understand him  attracted first by the title of the work   philosophy
of political economy   i have found  among the author s obscurities 
only the most ordinary ideas  for that reason i will not speak of him 

m  cousin  in his  moral philosophy   page 15  teaches that all
morality  all laws  all rights are given to man with this injunction 
 free being  remain free   bravo  master  i wish to remain free if i
can  he continues   

 our principle is true  it is good  it is social  do not fear to push it
to its ultimate 

 1  if the human person is sacred  its whole nature is sacred  and
particularly its interior actions  its feelings  its thoughts  its
voluntary decisions  this accounts for the respect due to philosophy 
religion  the arts industry  commerce  and to all the results of
liberty  i say respect  not simply toleration  for we do not tolerate a
right  we respect it  

i bow my head before this philosophy 


 2  my liberty  which is sacred  needs for its objective action an
instrument which we call the body  the body participates then in the
sacredness of liberty  it is then inviolable  this is the basis of the
principle of individual liberty 

 3  my liberty needs  for its objective action  material to work upon 
in other words  property or a thing  this thing or property naturally
participates then in the inviolability of my person  for instance  i
take possession of an object which has become necessary and useful in
the outward manifestation of my liberty  i say   this object is
mine since it belongs to no one else  consequently  i possess it
legitimately   so the legitimacy of possession rests on two conditions 
first  i possess only as a free being  suppress free activity  you
destroy my power to labor  now it is only by labor that i can use this
property or thing  and it is only by using it that i possess it  free
activity is then the principle of the right of property  but that alone
does not legitimate possession  all men are free  all can use property
by labor  does that mean that all men have a right to all property  not
at all  to possess legitimately  i must not only labor and produce in
my capacity of a free being  but i must also be the first to occupy the
property  in short  if labor and production are the principle of the
right of property  the fact of first occupancy is its indispensable
condition 

 4  i possess legitimately  then i have the right to use my property as
i see fit  i have also the right to give it away  i have also the right
to bequeath it  for if i decide to make a donation  my decision is as
valid after my death as during my life  

in fact  to become a proprietor  in m  cousin s opinion  one must take
possession by occupation and labor  i maintain that the element of time
must be considered also  for if the first occupants have occupied every
thing  what are the new comers to do  what will become of them  having
an instrument with which to work  but no material to work upon 
must they devour each other  a terrible extremity  unforeseen by
philosophical prudence  for the reason that great geniuses neglect
little things 

notice also that m  cousin says that neither occupation nor labor  taken
separately  can legitimate the right of property  and that it is born
only from the union of the two  this is one of m  cousin s eclectic
turns  which he  more than any one else  should take pains to
avoid  instead of proceeding by the method of analysis  comparison 
elimination  and reduction  the only means of discovering the truth amid
the various forms of thought and whimsical opinions   he jumbles
all systems together  and then  declaring each both right and wrong 
exclaims   there you have the truth  

but  adhering to my promise  i will not refute him  i will only prove 
by all the arguments with which he justifies the right of property  the
principle of equality which kills it  as i have already said  my sole
intent is this  to show at the bottom of all these positions that
inevitable major  equality  hoping hereafter to show that the principle
of property vitiates the very elements of economical  moral  and
governmental science  thus leading it in the wrong direction 

well  is it not true  from m  cousin s point of view  that  if the
liberty of man is sacred  it is equally sacred in all individuals  that 
if it needs property for its objective action  that is  for its life 
the appropriation of material is equally necessary for all  that  if i
wish to be respected in my right of appropriation  i must respect
others in theirs  and  consequently  that though  in the sphere of the
infinite  a person s power of appropriation is limited only by
himself  in the sphere of the finite this same power is limited by the
mathematical relation between the number of persons and the space which
they occupy  does it not follow that if one individual cannot prevent
another  his fellow man  from appropriating an amount of material equal
to his own  no more can he prevent individuals yet to come  because 
while individuality passes away  universality persists  and eternal laws
cannot be determined by a partial view of their manifestations  must we
not conclude  therefore  that whenever a person is born  the others must
crowd closer together  and  by reciprocity of obligation  that if the
new comer is afterwards to become an heir  the right of succession does
not give him the right of accumulation  but only the right of choice 

i have followed m  cousin so far as to imitate his style  and i am
ashamed of it  do we need such high sounding terms  such sonorous
phrases  to say such simple things  man needs to labor in order to live 
consequently  he needs tools to work with and materials to work upon 
his need to produce constitutes his right to produce  now  this right is
guaranteed him by his fellows  with whom he makes an agreement to that
effect  one hundred thousand men settle in a large country like france
with no inhabitants  each man has a right to 1/100 000 of the land  if
the number of possessors increases  each one s portion diminishes in
consequence  so that  if the number of inhabitants rises to thirty four
millions  each one will have a right only to 1/34 000 000  now 
so regulate the police system and the government  labor  exchange 
inheritance  &c   that the means of labor shall be shared by all
equally  and that each individual shall be free  and then society will
be perfect 

of all the defenders of property  m  cousin has gone the farthest  he
has maintained against the economists that labor does not establish the
right of property unless preceded by occupation  and against the jurists
that the civil law can determine and apply a natural right  but cannot
create it  in fact  it is not sufficient to say   the right of property
is demonstrated by the existence of property  the function of the civil
law is purely declaratory   to say that  is to confess that there is
no reply to those who question the legitimacy of the fact itself 
every right must be justifiable in itself  or by some antecedent right 
property is no exception  for this reason  m  cousin has sought to base
it upon the sanctity of the human personality  and the act by which the
will assimilates a thing   once touched by man   says one of m  cousin s
disciples   things receive from him a character which transforms and
humanizes them   i confess  for my part  that i have no faith in this
magic  and that i know of nothing less holy than the will of man  but
this theory  fragile as it seems to psychology as well as jurisprudence 
is nevertheless more philosophical and profound than those theories
which are based upon labor or the authority of the law  now  we have
just seen to what this theory of which we are speaking leads   to the
equality implied in the terms of its statement 

but perhaps philosophy views things from too lofty a standpoint  and
is not sufficiently practical  perhaps from the exalted summit of
speculation men seem so small to the metaphysician that he cannot
distinguish between them  perhaps  indeed  the equality of conditions is
one of those principles which are very true and sublime as generalities 
but which it would be ridiculous and even dangerous to attempt to
rigorously apply to the customs of life and to social transactions 
undoubtedly  this is a case which calls for imitation of the wise
reserve of moralists and jurists  who warn us against carrying things to
extremes  and who advise us to suspect every definition  because there
is not one  they say  which cannot be utterly destroyed by developing
its disastrous results   omnis definitio in jure civili periculosa
est  parum est enim ut non subverti possit   equality of conditions   a
terrible dogma in the ears of the proprietor  a consoling truth at
the poor man s sick bed  a frightful reality under the knife of the
anatomist   equality of conditions  established in the political  civil 
and industrial spheres  is only an alluring impossibility  an inviting
bait  a satanic delusion 

it is never my intention to surprise my reader  i detest  as i do death 
the man who employs subterfuge in his words and conduct  from the first
page of this book  i have expressed myself so plainly and decidedly that
all can see the tendency of my thought and hopes  and they will do me
the justice to say  that it would be difficult to exhibit more frankness
and more boldness at the same time  i do not hesitate to declare that
the time is not far distant when this reserve  now so much admired in
philosophers  this happy medium so strongly recommended by professors of
moral and political science  will be regarded as the disgraceful feature
of a science without principle  and as the seal of its reprobation  in
legislation and morals  as well as in geometry  axioms are absolute 
definitions are certain  and all the results of a principle are to be
accepted  provided they are logically deduced  deplorable pride  we know
nothing of our nature  and we charge our blunders to it  and  in a
fit of unaffected ignorance  cry out   the truth is in doubt  the
best definition defines nothing   we shall know some time whether this
distressing uncertainty of jurisprudence arises from the nature of
its investigations  or from our prejudices  whether  to explain social
phenomena  it is not enough to change our hypothesis  as did copernicus
when he reversed the system of ptolemy 

but what will be said when i show  as i soon shall  that this same
jurisprudence continually tries to base property upon equality  what
reply can be made 



  3   civil law as the foundation and sanction of property 

pothier seems to think that property  like royalty  exists by divine
right  he traces back its origin to god himself  ab jove principium  he
begins in this way   


 god is the absolute ruler of the universe and all that it contains 
 domini est terra et plenitudo ejus  orbis et universi qui habitant in
eo   for the human race he has created the earth and all its creatures 
and has given it a control over them subordinate only to his own   thou
madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands  thou hast put
all things under his feet   says the psalmist  god accompanied this gift
with these words  addressed to our first parents after the creation   be
fruitful  and multiply and replenish the earth    &c 


after this magnificent introduction  who would refuse to believe the
human race to be an immense family living in brotherly union  and
under the protection of a venerable father  but  heavens  are brothers
enemies  are fathers unnatural  and children prodigal 

god gave the earth to the human race  why then have i received none  he
has put all things under my feet   and i have not where to lay my head 
multiply  he tells us through his interpreter  pothier  ah  learned
pothier  that is as easy to do as to say  but you must give moss to the
bird for its nest 


 the human race having multiplied  men divided among themselves the
earth and most of the things upon it  that which fell to each  from that
time exclusively belonged to him  that was the origin of the right of
property  


say  rather  the right of possession  men lived in a state of communism 
whether positive or negative it matters little  then there was no
property  not even private possession  the genesis and growth of
possession gradually forcing people to labor for their support  they
agreed either formally or tacitly   it makes no difference which   that
the laborer should be sole proprietor of the fruit of his labor  that
is  they simply declared the fact that thereafter none could live
without working  it necessarily followed that  to obtain equality of
products  there must be equality of labor  and that  to obtain equality
of labor  there must be equality of facilities for labor  whoever
without labor got possession  by force or by strategy  of another s
means of subsistence  destroyed equality  and placed himself above or
outside of the law  whoever monopolized the means of production on the
ground of greater industry  also destroyed equality  equality being then
the expression of right  whoever violated it was unjust 

thus  labor gives birth to private possession  the right in a thing  jus
in re  but in what thing  evidently in the product  not in the soil 
so the arabs have always understood it  and so  according to caesar and
tacitus  the germans formerly held   the arabs   says m  de sismondi 
 who admit a man s property in the flocks which he has raised  do not
refuse the crop to him who planted the seed  but they do not see why
another  his equal  should not have a right to plant in his turn 
the inequality which results from the pretended right of the first
occupant seems to them to be based on no principle of justice  and when
all the land falls into the hands of a certain number of inhabitants 
there results a monopoly in their favor against the rest of the nation 
to which they do not wish to submit  

well  they have shared the land  i admit that therefrom results a more
powerful organization of labor  and that this method of distribution 
fixed and durable  is advantageous to production  but how could this
division give to each a transferable right of property in a thing
to which all had an inalienable right of possession  in the terms
of jurisprudence  this metamorphosis from possessor to proprietor is
legally impossible  it implies in the jurisdiction of the courts the
union of possessoire and petitoire  and the mutual concessions of those
who share the land are nothing less than traffic in natural rights  the
original cultivators of the land  who were also the original makers of
the law  were not as learned as our legislators  i admit  and had
they been  they could not have done worse  they did not foresee the
consequences of the transformation of the right of private possession
into the right of absolute property  but why have not those  who in
later times have established the distinction between jus in re and jus
ad rem  applied it to the principle of property itself 

let me call the attention of the writers on jurisprudence to their own
maxims 

the right of property  provided it can have a cause  can have but
one   dominium non potest nisi ex una causa contingere   i can possess
by several titles  i can become proprietor by only one   non ut ex
pluribus causis idem nobis deberi potest  ita ex pluribus causis idem
potest nostrum esse   the field which i have cleared  which i cultivate 
on which i have built my house  which supports myself  my family  and
my livestock  i can possess  1st  as the original occupant  2d  as a
laborer  3d  by virtue of the social contract which assigns it to me as
my share 

but none of these titles confer upon me the right of property  for  if i
attempt to base it upon occupancy  society can reply   i am the original
occupant   if i appeal to my labor  it will say   it is only on that
condition that you possess   if i speak of agreements  it will respond 
 these agreements establish only your right of use   such  however  are
the only titles which proprietors advance  they never have been able
to discover any others  indeed  every right  it is pothier who says
it  supposes a producing cause in the person who enjoys it  but in man
who lives and dies  in this son of earth who passes away like a
shadow  there exists  with respect to external things  only titles of
possession  not one title of property  why  then  has society recognized
a right injurious to itself  where there is no producing cause  why 
in according possession  has it also conceded property  why has the law
sanctioned this abuse of power 

the german ancillon replies thus   


 some philosophers pretend that man  in employing his forces upon a
natural object   say a field or a tree   acquires a right only to the
improvements which he makes  to the form which he gives to the object 
not to the object itself  useless distinction  if the form could be
separated from the object  perhaps there would be room for question  but
as this is almost always impossible  the application of man s strength
to the different parts of the visible world is the foundation of the
right of property  the primary origin of riches  


vain pretext  if the form cannot be separated from the object  nor
property from possession  possession must be shared  in any case 
society reserves the right to fix the conditions of property  let us
suppose that an appropriated farm yields a gross income of ten thousand
francs  and  as very seldom happens  that this farm cannot be divided 
let us suppose farther that  by economical calculation  the annual
expenses of a family are three thousand francs  the possessor of this
farm should be obliged to guard his reputation as a good father of a
family  by paying to society ten thousand francs   less the total
costs of cultivation  and the three thousand francs required for the
maintenance of his family  this payment is not rent  it is an indemnity 

what sort of justice is it  then  which makes such laws as this   


 whereas  since labor so changes the form of a thing that the form
and substance cannot be separated without destroying the thing itself 
either society must be disinherited  or the laborer must lose the fruit
of his labor  and

 whereas  in every other case  property in raw material would give a
title to added improvements  minus their cost  and whereas  in this
instance  property in improvements ought to give a title to the
principal 

 therefore  the right of appropriation by labor shall never be admitted
against individuals  but only against society  

in such a way do legislators always reason in regard to property 

the law is intended to protect men s mutual rights   that is  the rights
of each against each  and each against all  and  as if a proportion
could exist with less than four terms  the law makers always disregard
the latter  as long as man is opposed to man  property offsets property 
and the two forces balance each other  as soon as man is isolated  that
is  opposed to the society which he himself represents  jurisprudence is
at fault  themis has lost one scale of her balance 

listen to the professor of rennes  the learned toullier   


 how could this claim  made valid by occupation  become stable and
permanent property  which might continue to stand  and which might be
reclaimed after the first occupant had relinquished possession 

 agriculture was a natural consequence of the multiplication of the
human race  and agriculture  in its turn  favors population  and
necessitates the establishment of permanent property  for who would
take the trouble to plough and sow  if he were not certain that he would
reap  


to satisfy the husbandman  it was sufficient to guarantee him possession
of his crop  admit even that he should have been protected in his right
of occupation of land  as long as he remained its cultivator  that was
all that he had a right to expect  that was all that the advance of
civilization demanded  but property  property  the right of escheat over
lands which one neither occupies nor cultivates   who had authority to
grant it  who pretended to have it 


 agriculture alone was not sufficient to establish permanent property 
positive laws were needed  and magistrates to execute them  in a word 
the civil state was needed 

 the multiplication of the human race had rendered agriculture
necessary  the need of securing to the cultivator the fruit of his labor
made permanent property necessary  and also laws for its protection  so
we are indebted to property for the creation of the civil state  


yes  of our civil state  as you have made it  a state which  at first 
was despotism  then monarchy  then aristocracy  today democracy  and
always tyranny 


 without the ties of property it never would have been possible to
subordinate men to the wholesome yoke of the law  and without permanent
property the earth would have remained a vast forest  let us admit 
then  with the most careful writers  that if transient property  or
the right of preference resulting from occupation  existed prior to
the establishment of civil society  permanent property  as we know it
to day  is the work of civil law  it is the civil law which holds that 
when once acquired  property can be lost only by the action of
the proprietor  and that it exists even after the proprietor has
relinquished possession of the thing  and it has fallen into the hands
of a third party 

 thus property and possession  which originally were confounded  became
through the civil law two distinct and independent things  two things
which  in the language of the law  have nothing whatever in common  in
this we see what a wonderful change has been effected in property  and
to what an extent nature has been altered by the civil laws  

thus the law  in establishing property  has not been the expression of a
psychological fact  the development of a natural law  the application of
a moral principle  it has literally created a right outside of its own
province  it has realized an abstraction  a metaphor  a fiction  and
that without deigning to look at the consequences  without considering
the disadvantages  without inquiring whether it was right or wrong 

it has sanctioned selfishness  it has indorsed monstrous pretensions 
it has received with favor impious vows  as if it were able to fill up a
bottomless pit  and to satiate hell  blind law  the law of the ignorant
man  a law which is not a law  the voice of discord  deceit  and
blood  this it is which  continually revived  reinstated  rejuvenated 
restored  re enforced  as the palladium of society  has troubled the
consciences of the people  has obscured the minds of the masters  and
has induced all the catastrophes which have befallen nations 

this it is which christianity has condemned  but which its ignorant
ministers deify  who have as little desire to study nature and man  as
ability to read their scriptures 

but  indeed  what guide did the law follow in creating the domain of
property  what principle directed it  what was its standard 

would you believe it  it was equality 

agriculture was the foundation of territorial possession  and the
original cause of property  it was of no use to secure to the farmer the
fruit of his labor  unless the means of production were at the same time
secured to him  to fortify the weak against the invasion of the strong 
to suppress spoliation and fraud  the necessity was felt of establishing
between possessors permanent lines of division  insuperable obstacles 
every year saw the people multiply  and the cupidity of the husbandman
increase  it was thought best to put a bridle on ambition by setting
boundaries which ambition would in vain attempt to overstep  thus the
soil came to be appropriated through need of the equality which is
essential to public security and peaceable possession  undoubtedly the
division was never geographically equal  a multitude of rights  some
founded in nature  but wrongly interpreted and still more wrongly
applied  inheritance  gift  and exchange  others  like the privileges
of birth and position  the illegitimate creations of ignorance and brute
force   all operated to prevent absolute equality  but  nevertheless 
the principle remained the same  equality had sanctioned possession 
equality sanctioned property 

the husbandman needed each year a field to sow  what more convenient and
simple arrangement for the barbarians   instead of indulging in annual
quarrels and fights  instead of continually moving their houses 
furniture  and families from spot to spot   than to assign to each
individual a fixed and inalienable estate 

it was not right that the soldier  on returning from an expedition 
should find himself dispossessed on account of the services which he had
just rendered to his country  his estate ought to be restored to him  it
became  therefore  customary to retain property by intent alone   nudo
animo   it could be sacrificed only with the consent and by the action
of the proprietor 

it was necessary that the equality in the division should be kept up
from one generation to another  without a new distribution of the land
upon the death of each family  it appeared therefore natural and just
that children and parents  according to the degree of relationship
which they bore to the deceased  should be the heirs of their ancestors 
thence came  in the first place  the feudal and patriarchal custom of
recognizing only one heir  then  by a quite contrary application of the
principle of equality  the admission of all the children to a share in
their father s estate  and  very recently also among us  the definitive
abolition of the right of primogeniture 

but what is there in common between these rude outlines of instinctive
organization and the true social science  how could these men  who never
had the faintest idea of statistics  valuation  or political economy 
furnish us with principles of legislation 

 the law   says a modern writer on jurisprudence   is the expression of
a social want  the declaration of a fact  the legislator does not make
it  he declares it   this definition is not exact  the law is a method
by which social wants must be satisfied  the people do not vote it  the
legislator does not express it  the savant discovers and formulates it  
but in fact  the law  according to m  ch  comte  who has devoted half a
volume to its definition  was in the beginning only the expression of
a want  and the indication of the means of supplying it  and up to this
time it has been nothing else  the legists  with mechanical fidelity 
full of obstinacy  enemies of philosophy  buried in literalities  have
always mistaken for the last word of science that which was only the
inconsiderate aspiration of men who  to be sure  were well meaning  but
wanting in foresight 

they did not foresee  these old founders of the domain of property  that
the perpetual and absolute right to retain one s estate   a right which
seemed to them equitable  because it was common   involves the right to
transfer  sell  give  gain  and lose it  that it tends  consequently 
to nothing less than the destruction of that equality which they
established it to maintain  and though they should have foreseen it 
they disregarded it  the present want occupied their whole attention 
and  as ordinarily happens in such cases  the disadvantages were at
first scarcely perceptible  and they passed unnoticed 

they did not foresee  these ingenuous legislators  that if property is
retainable by intent alone   nudo animo   it carries with it the right
to let  to lease  to loan at interest  to profit by exchange  to settle
annuities  and to levy a tax on a field which intent reserves  while the
body is busy elsewhere 

they did not foresee  these fathers of our jurisprudence  that  if
the right of inheritance is any thing other than nature s method of
preserving equality of wealth  families will soon become victims of the
most disastrous exclusions  and society  pierced to the heart by one of
its most sacred principles  will come to its death through opulence and
misery   12 

under whatever form of government we live  it can always be said that
 le mort saisit le vif   that is  that inheritance and succession will
last for ever  whoever may be the recognized heir  but the st  simonians
wish the heir to be designated by the magistrate  others wish him to
be chosen by the deceased  or assumed by the law to be so chosen  the
essential point is that nature s wish be satisfied  so far as the law of
equality allows 

to day the real controller of inheritance is chance or caprice  now  in
matters of legislation  chance and caprice cannot be accepted as guides 
it is for the purpose of avoiding the manifold disturbances which
follow in the wake of chance that nature  after having created us equal 
suggests to us the principle of heredity  which serves as a voice by
which society asks us to choose  from among all our brothers  him whom
we judge best fitted to complete our unfinished work 


they did not foresee     but why need i go farther 

the consequences are plain enough  and this is not the time to criticise
the whole code 

the history of property among the ancient nations is  then  simply a
matter of research and curiosity  it is a rule of jurisprudence that the
fact does not substantiate the right  now  property is no exception to
this rule  then the universal recognition of the right of property
does not legitimate the right of property  man is mistaken as to the
constitution of society  the nature of right  and the application of
justice  just as he was mistaken regarding the cause of meteors and the
movement of the heavenly bodies  his old opinions cannot be taken for
articles of faith  of what consequence is it to us that the indian race
was divided into four classes  that  on the banks of the nile and the
ganges  blood and position formerly determined the distribution of the
land  that the greeks and romans placed property under the protection
of the gods  that they accompanied with religious ceremonies the work
of partitioning the land and appraising their goods  the variety of the
forms of privilege does not sanction injustice  the faith of jupiter 
the proprietor   13  proves no more against the equality of citizens 
than do the mysteries of venus  the wanton  against conjugal chastity 


the authority of the human race is of no effect as evidence in favor
of the right of property  because this right  resting of necessity upon
equality  contradicts its principle  the decision of the religions which
have sanctioned it is of no effect  because in all ages the priest
has submitted to the prince  and the gods have always spoken as the
politicians desired  the social advantages  attributed to property 
cannot be cited in its behalf  because they all spring from the
principle of equality of possession 

what means  then  this dithyramb upon property 


 the right of property is the most important of human institutions     


yes  as monarchy is the most glorious 


 the original cause of man s prosperity upon earth  


because justice was supposed to be its principle 


 property became the legitimate end of his ambition  the hope of his
existence  the shelter of his family  in a word  the corner stone of the
domestic dwelling  of communities  and of the political state  


possession alone produced all that 


 eternal principle    


property is eternal  like every negation   


 of all social and civil institutions  


for that reason  every institution and every law based on property will
perish 


 it is a boon as precious as liberty  


for the rich proprietor 


 in fact  the cause of the cultivation of the habitable earth  

if the cultivator ceased to be a tenant  would the land be worse cared
for 


 the guarantee and the morality of labor  


under the regime of property  labor is not a condition  but a privilege 


 the application of justice  


what is justice without equality of fortunes  a balance with false
weights 


 all morality    


a famished stomach knows no morality   


 all public order    


certainly  the preservation of property   

 rest on the right of property    14 


corner stone of all which is  stumbling block of all which ought to
be   such is property 


to sum up and conclude   

not only does occupation lead to equality  it prevents property  for 
since every man  from the fact of his existence  has the right of
occupation  and  in order to live  must have material for cultivation
on which he may labor  and since  on the other hand  the number of
occupants varies continually with the births and deaths   it follows
that the quantity of material which each laborer may claim varies
with the number of occupants  consequently  that occupation is always
subordinate to population  finally  that  inasmuch as possession  in
right  can never remain fixed  it is impossible  in fact  that it can
ever become property 

every occupant is  then  necessarily a possessor or usufructuary   a
function which excludes proprietorship  now  this is the right of the
usufructuary  he is responsible for the thing entrusted to him  he
must use it in conformity with general utility  with a view to its
preservation and development  he has no power to transform it  to
diminish it  or to change its nature  he cannot so divide the usufruct
that another shall perform the labor while he receives the product  in a
word  the usufructuary is under the supervision of society  submitted to
the condition of labor and the law of equality 

thus is annihilated the roman definition of property  the right of use
and abuse  an immorality born of violence  the most monstrous pretension
that the civil laws ever sanctioned  man receives his usufruct from the
hands of society  which alone is the permanent possessor  the individual
passes away  society is deathless 

what a profound disgust fills my soul while discussing such simple
truths  do we doubt these things to day  will it be necessary to again
take arms for their triumph  and can force  in default of reason  alone
introduce them into our laws 

all have an equal right of occupancy 

the amount occupied being measured  not by the will  but by the variable
conditions of space and number  property cannot exist 

this no code has ever expressed  this no constitution can admit  these
are axioms which the civil law and the law of nations deny      

but i hear the exclamations of the partisans of another system   labor 
labor  that is the basis of property  

reader  do not be deceived  this new basis of property is worse than the
first  and i shall soon have to ask your pardon for having demonstrated
things clearer  and refuted pretensions more unjust  than any which we
have yet considered 




chapter iii  labor as the efficient cause of the domain of property 

nearly all the modern writers on jurisprudence  taking their cue from
the economists  have abandoned the theory of first occupancy as a too
dangerous one  and have adopted that which regards property as born of
labor  in this they are deluded  they reason in a circle  to labor it is
necessary to occupy  says m  cousin 

consequently  i have added in my turn  all having an equal right of
occupancy  to labor it is necessary to submit to equality   the rich  
exclaims jean jacques   have the arrogance to say   i built this wall  i
earned this land by my labor   who set you the tasks  we may reply  and
by what right do you demand payment from us for labor which we did not
impose upon you   all sophistry falls to the ground in the presence of
this argument 

but the partisans of labor do not see that their system is an absolute
contradiction of the code  all the articles and provisions of which
suppose property to be based upon the fact of first occupancy  if labor 
through the appropriation which results from it  alone gives birth to
property  the civil code lies  the charter is a falsehood  our whole
social system is a violation of right  to this conclusion shall we come 
at the end of the discussion which is to occupy our attention in this
chapter and the following one  both as to the right of labor and the
fact of property  we shall see  on the one hand  our legislation in
opposition to itself  and  on the other hand  our new jurisprudence in
opposition both to its own principle and to our legislation 

i have asserted that the system which bases property upon labor implies 
no less than that which bases it upon occupation  the equality of
fortunes  and the reader must be impatient to learn how i propose to
deduce this law of equality from the inequality of skill and faculties 
directly his curiosity shall be satisfied  but it is proper that i
should call his attention for a moment to this remarkable feature of
the process  to wit  the substitution of labor for occupation as the
principle of property  and that i should pass rapidly in review some
of the prejudices to which proprietors are accustomed to appeal  which
legislation has sanctioned  and which the system of labor completely
overthrows 

reader  were you ever present at the examination of a criminal  have
you watched his tricks  his turns  his evasions  his distinctions  his
equivocations  beaten  all his assertions overthrown  pursued like
a fallow deer by the in exorable judge  tracked from hypothesis
to hypothesis   he makes a statement  he corrects it  retracts it 
contradicts it  he exhausts all the tricks of dialectics  more subtle 
more ingenious a thousand times than he who invented the seventy two
forms of the syllogism  so acts the proprietor when called upon
to defend his right  at first he refuses to reply  he exclaims  he
threatens  he defies  then  forced to accept the discussion  he
arms himself with chicanery  he surrounds himself with formidable
artillery   crossing his fire  opposing one by one and all together
occupation  possession  limitation  covenants  immemorial custom  and
universal consent  conquered on this ground  the proprietor  like a
wounded boar  turns on his pursuers   i have done more than occupy  
he cries with terrible emotion   i have labored  produced  improved 
transformed  created  this house  these fields  these trees are the work
of my hands  i changed these brambles into a vineyard  and this bush
into a fig tree  and to day i reap the harvest of my labors  i have
enriched the soil with my sweat  i have paid those men who  had they not
had the work which i gave them  would have died of hunger  no one
shared with me the trouble and expense  no one shall share with me the
benefits  

you have labored  proprietor  why then do you speak of original
occupancy  what  were you not sure of your right  or did you hope to
deceive men  and make justice an illusion  make haste  then  to acquaint
us with your mode of defence  for the judgment will be final  and you
know it to be a question of restitution 

you have labored  but what is there in common between the labor which
duty compels you to perform  and the appropriation of things in which
there is a common interest  do you not know that domain over the soil 
like that over air and light  cannot be lost by prescription 

you have labored  have you never made others labor  why  then  have they
lost in laboring for you what you have gained in not laboring for them 

you have labored  very well  but let us see the results of your labor 
we will count  weigh  and measure them  it will be the judgment of
balthasar  for i swear by balance  level  and square  that if you have
appropriated another s labor in any way whatsoever  you shall restore it
every stroke 

thus  the principle of occupation is abandoned  no longer is it said 
 the land belongs to him who first gets possession of it   property 
forced into its first intrenchment  repudiates its old adage  justice 
ashamed  retracts her maxims  and sorrow lowers her bandage over her
blushing cheeks  and it was but yesterday that this progress in social
philosophy began  fifty centuries required for the extirpation of a
lie  during this lamentable period  how many usurpations have been
sanctioned  how many invasions glorified  how many conquests celebrated 
the absent dispossessed  the poor banished  the hungry excluded by
wealth  which is so ready and bold in action  jealousies and wars 
incendiarism and bloodshed  among the nations  but henceforth  thanks
to the age and its spirit  it is to be admitted that the earth is not a
prize to be won in a race  in the absence of any other obstacle  there
is a place for everybody under the sun  each one may harness his goat
to the bearn  drive his cattle to pasture  sow a corner of a field  and
bake his bread by his own fireside 

but  no  each one cannot do these things  i hear it proclaimed on all
sides   glory to labor and industry  to each according to his capacity 
to each capacity according to its results   and i see three fourths of
the human race again despoiled  the labor of a few being a scourge to
the labor of the rest 


 the problem is solved   exclaims m  hennequin   property  the daughter
of labor  can be enjoyed at present and in the future only under the
protection of the laws  it has its origin in natural law  it derives its
power from civil law  and from the union of these two ideas  labor and
protection  positive legislation results     


ah  the problem is solved  property is the daughter of labor  what 
then  is the right of accession  and the right of succession  and the
right of donation  &c   if not the right to become a proprietor by
simple occupancy  what are your laws concerning the age of majority 
emancipation  guardianship  and interdiction  if not the various
conditions by which he who is already a laborer gains or loses the right
of occupancy  that is  property 

being unable  at this time  to enter upon a detailed discussion of the
code  i shall content myself with examining the three arguments oftenest
resorted to in support of property  1  appropriation  or the formation
of property by possession  2  the consent of mankind  3  prescription  i
shall then inquire into the effects of labor upon the relative condition
of the laborers and upon property 



  1   the land cannot be appropriated 

 it would seem that lands capable of cultivation ought to be regarded
as natural wealth  since they are not of human creation  but nature s
gratuitous gift to man  but inasmuch as this wealth is not fugitive 
like the air and water   inasmuch as a field is a fixed and limited
space which certain men have been able to appropriate  to the
exclusion of all others who in their turn have consented to this
appropriation   the land  which was a natural and gratuitous gift 
has become social wealth  for the use of which we ought to pay    say 
political economy 


was i wrong in saying  at the beginning of this chapter  that the
economists are the very worst authorities in matters of legislation and
philosophy  it is the father of this class of men who clearly states
the question  how can the supplies of nature  the wealth created by
providence  become private property  and who replies by so gross an
equivocation that we scarcely know which the author lacks  sense or
honesty  what  i ask  has the fixed and solid nature of the earth to do
with the right of appropriation  i can understand that a thing limited
and stationary  like the land  offers greater chances for appropriation
than the water or the sunshine  that it is easier to exercise the right
of domain over the soil than over the atmosphere  but we are not dealing
with the difficulty of the thing  and say confounds the right with the
possibility  we do not ask why the earth has been appropriated to a
greater extent than the sea and the air  we want to know by what right
man has appropriated wealth which he did not create  and which nature
gave to him gratuitously 

say  then  did not solve the question which he asked  but if he had
solved it  if the explanation which he has given us were as satisfactory
as it is illogical  we should know no better than before who has a right
to exact payment for the use of the soil  of this wealth which is not
man s handiwork  who is entitled to the rent of the land  the producer
of the land  without doubt  who made the land  god  then  proprietor 
retire 

but the creator of the land does not sell it  he gives it  and  in
giving it  he is no respecter of persons  why  then  are some of his
children regarded as legitimate  while others are treated as bastards 
if the equality of shares was an original right  why is the inequality
of conditions a posthumous right 

say gives us to understand that if the air and the water were not of a
fugitive nature  they would have been appropriated  let me observe in
passing that this is more than an hypothesis  it is a reality  men have
appropriated the air and the water  i will not say as often as they
could  but as often as they have been allowed to 

the portuguese  having discovered the route to india by the cape of
good hope  pretended to have the sole right to that route  and grotius 
consulted in regard to this matter by the dutch who refused to recognize
this right  wrote expressly for this occasion his treatise on
the  freedom of the seas   to prove that the sea is not liable to
appropriation 

the right to hunt and fish used always to be confined to lords and
proprietors  to day it is leased by the government and communes to
whoever can pay the license fee and the rent  to regulate hunting and
fishing is an excellent idea  but to make it a subject of sale is to
create a monopoly of air and water 

what is a passport  a universal recommendation of the traveller s
person  a certificate of security for himself and his property  the
treasury  whose nature it is to spoil the best things  has made the
passport a means of espionage and a tax  is not this a sale of the right
to travel 

finally  it is permissible neither to draw water from a spring situated
in another s grounds without the permission of the proprietor  because
by the right of accession the spring belongs to the possessor of the
soil  if there is no other claim  nor to pass a day on his premises
without paying a tax  nor to look at a court  a garden  or an orchard 
without the consent of the proprietor  nor to stroll in a park or an
enclosure against the owner s will  every one is allowed to shut himself
up and to fence himself in  all these prohibitions are so many positive
interdictions  not only of the land  but of the air and water  we who
belong to the proletaire class  property excommunicates us   terra  et
aqua  et aere  et igne interdicti sumus  

men could not appropriate the most fixed of all the elements without
appropriating the three others  since  by french and roman law  property
in the surface carries with it property from zenith to nadir   cujus
est solum  ejus est usque ad caelum   now  if the use of water  air 
and fire excludes property  so does the use of the soil  this chain of
reasoning seems to have been presented by m  ch  comte  in his  treatise
on property   chap  5 


 if a man should be deprived of air for a few moments only  he would
cease to exist  and a partial deprivation would cause him severe
suffering  a partial or complete deprivation of food would produce like
effects upon him though less suddenly  it would be the same  at least
in certain climates  were he deprived of all clothing and shelter     to
sustain life  then  man needs continually to appropriate many different
things  but these things do not exist in like proportions  some  such as
the light of the stars  the atmosphere of the earth  the water composing
the seas and oceans  exist in such large quantities that men cannot
perceive any sensible increase or diminution  each one can appropriate
as much as his needs require without detracting from the enjoyment of
others  without causing them the least harm  things of this sort are  so
to speak  the common property of the human race  the only duty imposed
upon each individual in this regard is that of infringing not at all
upon the rights of others  


let us complete the argument of m  ch  comte  a man who should be
prohibited from walking in the highways  from resting in the fields 
from taking shelter in caves  from lighting fires  from picking berries 
from gathering herbs and boiling them in a bit of baked clay   such
a man could not live  consequently the earth  like water  air  and
light  is a primary object of necessity which each has a right to use
freely  without infringing another s right  why  then  is the earth
appropriated  m  ch  comte s reply is a curious one  say pretends that
it is because it is not fugitive  m  ch  comte assures us that it
is because it is not infinite  the land is limited in amount  then 
according to m  ch  comte  it ought to be appropriated  it would
seem  on the contrary  that he ought to say  then it ought not to be
appropriated  because  no matter how large a quantity of air or light
any one appropriates  no one is damaged thereby  there always remains
enough for all  with the soil  it is very different  lay hold who will 
or who can  of the sun s rays  the passing breeze  or the sea s billows 
he has my consent  and my pardon for his bad intentions  but let any
living man dare to change his right of territorial possession into the
right of property  and i will declare war upon him  and wage it to the
death 

m  ch  comte s argument disproves his position   among the things
necessary to the preservation of life   he says   there are some which
exist in such large quantities that they are inexhaustible  others which
exist in lesser quantities  and can satisfy the wants of only a certain
number of persons  the former are called common  the latter private  

this reasoning is not strictly logical  water  air  and light are
common things  not because they are inexhaustible  but because they are
indispensable  and so indispensable that for that very reason nature
has created them in quantities almost infinite  in order that their
plentifulness might prevent their appropriation  likewise the land
is indispensable to our existence   consequently a common thing 
consequently insusceptible of appropriation  but land is much scarcer
than the other elements  therefore its use must be regulated  not for
the profit of a few  but in the interest and for the security of all 

in a word  equality of rights is proved by equality of needs  now 
equality of rights  in the case of a commodity which is limited in
amount  can be realized only by equality of possession  an agrarian law
underlies m  ch  comte s arguments 

from whatever point we view this question of property  provided we go
to the bottom of it  we reach equality  i will not insist farther on
the distinction between things which can  and things which cannot  be
appropriated  on this point  economists and legists talk worse than
nonsense  the civil code  after having defined property  says nothing
about susceptibility of appropriation  and if it speaks of things which
are in the market  it always does so without enumerating or describing
them  however  light is not wanting  there are some few maxims such as
these   ad reges potestas omnium pertinet  ad singulos proprietas  omnia
rex imperio possidet  singula dominio   social sovereignty opposed to
private property   might not that be called a prophecy of equality  a
republican oracle  examples crowd upon us  once the possessions of
the church  the estates of the crown  the fiefs of the nobility
were inalienable and imprescriptible  if  instead of abolishing this
privilege  the constituent had extended it to every individual  if
it had declared that the right of labor  like liberty  can never be
forfeited   at that moment the revolution would have been consummated 
and we could now devote ourselves to improvement in other directions 



  2   universal consent no justification of property 

in the extract from say  quoted above  it is not clear whether the
author means to base the right of property on the stationary character
of the soil  or on the consent which he thinks all men have granted
to this appropriation  his language is such that it may mean either
of these things  or both at once  which entitles us to assume that the
author intended to say   the right of property resulting originally from
the exercise of the will  the stability of the soil permitted it to be
applied to the land  and universal consent has since sanctioned this
application  

however that may be  can men legitimate property by mutual consent  i
say  no  such a contract  though drafted by grotius  montesquieu  and j 
j  rousseau  though signed by the whole human race  would be null in the
eyes of justice  and an act to enforce it would be illegal  man can
no more give up labor than liberty  now  to recognize the right of
territorial property is to give up labor  since it is to relinquish
the means of labor  it is to traffic in a natural right  and divest
ourselves of manhood 

but i wish that this consent  of which so much is made  had been given 
either tacitly or formally  what would have been the result  evidently 
the surrenders would have been reciprocal  no right would have been
abandoned without the receipt of an equivalent in exchange  we thus come
back to equality again   the sine qua non of appropriation  so that 
after having justified property by universal consent  that is  by
equality  we are obliged to justify the inequality of conditions by
property  never shall we extricate ourselves from this dilemma  indeed 
if  in the terms of the social compact  property has equality for its
condition  at the moment when equality ceases to exist  the compact is
broken and all property becomes usurpation  we gain nothing  then  by
this pretended consent of mankind 



  3   prescription gives no title to property 

the right of property was the origin of evil on the earth  the first
link in the long chain of crimes and misfortunes which the human race
has endured since its birth  the delusion of prescription is the fatal
charm thrown over the intellect  the death sentence breathed into the
conscience  to arrest man s progress towards truth  and bolster up the
worship of error 

the code defines prescription thus   the process of gaining and losing
through the lapse of time   in applying this definition to ideas and
beliefs  we may use the word prescription to denote the everlasting
prejudice in favor of old superstitions  whatever be their object  the
opposition  often furious and bloody  with which new light has always
been received  and which makes the sage a martyr  not a principle  not a
discovery  not a generous thought but has met  at its entrance into the
world  with a formidable barrier of preconceived opinions  seeming
like a conspiracy of all old prejudices  prescriptions against reason 
prescriptions against facts  prescriptions against every truth hitherto
unknown   that is the sum and substance of the  statu quo  philosophy 
the watchword of conservatives throughout the centuries 

when the evangelical reform was broached to the world  there was
prescription in favor of violence  debauchery  and selfishness  when
galileo  descartes  pascal  and their disciples reconstructed philosophy
and the sciences  there was prescription in favor of the aristotelian
philosophy  when our fathers of  89 demanded liberty and equality  there
was prescription in favor of tyranny and privilege   there always have
been proprietors and there always will be   it is with this profound
utterance  the final effort of selfishness dying in its last ditch 
that the friends of social inequality hope to repel the attacks of their
adversaries  thinking undoubtedly that ideas  like property  can be lost
by prescription 

enlightened to day by the triumphal march of science  taught by the most
glorious successes to question our own opinions  we receive with favor
and applause the observer of nature  who  by a thousand experiments
based upon the most profound analysis  pursues a new principle  a law
hitherto undiscovered  we take care to repel no idea  no fact  under the
pretext that abler men than ourselves lived in former days  who did not
notice the same phenomena  nor grasp the same analogies  why do we not
preserve a like attitude towards political and philosophical questions 
why this ridiculous mania for affirming that every thing has been said 
which means that we know all about mental and moral science  why is
the proverb  there is nothing new under the sun  applied exclusively to
metaphysical investigations 

because we still study philosophy with the imagination  instead of by
observation and method  because fancy and will are universally regarded
as judges  in the place of arguments and facts   it has been impossible
to this day to distinguish the charlatan from the philosopher  the
savant from the impostor  since the days of solomon and pythagoras 
imagination has been exhausted in guessing out social and psychological
laws  all systems have been proposed  looked at in this light  it is
probably true that every thing has been said  but it is no less true
that every thing remains to be proved  in politics  to take only this
branch of philosophy   in politics every one is governed in his choice
of party by his passion and his interests  the mind is submitted to the
impositions of the will   there is no knowledge  there is not even a
shadow of certainty  in this way  general ignorance produces general
tyranny  and while liberty of thought is written in the charter  slavery
of thought  under the name of majority rule  is decreed by the charter 

in order to confine myself to the civil prescription of which the code
speaks  i shall refrain from beginning a discussion upon this worn out
objection brought forward by proprietors  it would be too tiresome
and declamatory  everybody knows that there are rights which cannot be
prescribed  and  as for those things which can be gained through the
lapse of time  no one is ignorant of the fact that prescription requires
certain conditions  the omission of one of which renders it null  if it
is true  for example  that the proprietor s possession has been civil 
public  peaceable  and uninterrupted  it is none the less true that
it is not based on a just title  since the only titles which it can
show  occupation and labor  prove as much for the proletaire who
demands  as for the proprietor who defends  further  this possession is
dishonest  since it is founded on a violation of right  which prevents
prescription  according to the saying of st  paul   nunquam in
usucapionibus juris error possessori prodest   the violation of right
lies either in the fact that the holder possesses as proprietor  while
he should possess only as usufructuary  or in the fact that he has
purchased a thing which no one had a right to transfer or sell 

another reason why prescription cannot be adduced in favor of property
 a reason borrowed from jurisprudence  is that the right to possess
real estate is a part of a universal right which has never been totally
destroyed even at the most critical periods  and the proletaire  in
order to regain the power to exercise it fully  has only to prove that
he has always exercised it in part 

he  for example  who has the universal right to possess  give  exchange 
loan  let  sell  transform  or destroy a thing  preserves the integrity
of this right by the sole act of loaning  though he has never shown his
authority in any other manner  likewise we shall see that equality of
possessions  equality of rights  liberty  will  personality  are so
many identical expressions of one and the same idea   the right of
preservation and development  in a word  the right of life  against
which there can be no prescription until the human race has vanished
from the face of the earth 

finally  as to the time required for prescription  it would be
superfluous to show that the right of property in general cannot be
acquired by simple possession for ten  twenty  a hundred  a thousand 
or one hundred thousand years  and that  so long as there exists a human
head capable of understanding and combating the right of property  this
right will never be prescribed  for principles of jurisprudence and
axioms of reason are different from accidental and contingent facts 
one man s possession can prescribe against another man s possession  but
just as the possessor cannot prescribe against himself  so reason has
always the faculty of change and reformation  past error is not binding
on the future  reason is always the same eternal force  the institution
of property  the work of ignorant reason  may be abrogated by a more
enlightened reason  consequently  property cannot be established by
prescription  this is so certain and so true  that on it rests the
maxim that in the matter of prescription a violation of right goes for
nothing 

but i should be recreant to my method  and the reader would have the
right to accuse me of charlatanism and bad faith  if i had nothing
further to advance concerning prescription  i showed  in the first
place  that appropriation of land is illegal  and that  supposing it to
be legal  it must be accompanied by equality of property  i have shown 
in the second place  that universal consent proves nothing in favor
of property  and that  if it proves any thing  it proves equality of
property  i have yet to show that prescription  if admissible at all 
presupposes equality of property 

this demonstration will be neither long nor difficult  i need only to
call attention to the reasons why prescription was introduced 


 prescription   says dunod   seems repugnant to natural equity  which
permits no one either to deprive another of his possessions without his
knowledge and consent  or to enrich himself at another s expense  but as
it might often happen  in the absence of prescription  that one who had
honestly earned would be ousted after long possession  and even that
he who had received a thing from its rightful owner  or who had been
legitimately relieved from all obligations  would  on losing his title 
be liable to be dispossessed or subjected again   the public welfare
demanded that a term should be fixed  after the expiration of which no
one should be allowed to disturb actual possessors  or reassert rights
too long neglected     the civil law  in regulating prescription  has
aimed  then  only to perfect natural law  and to supplement the law of
nations  and as it is founded on the public good  which should always be
considered before individual welfare    bono publico usucapio introducta
est    it should be regarded with favor  provided the conditions
required by the law are fulfilled  

toullier  in his  civil law   says   in order that the question of
proprietorship may not remain too long unsettled  and thereby injure the
public welfare  disturbing the peace of families and the stability of
social transactions  the law has fixed a time when all claims shall be
cancelled  and possession shall regain its ancient prerogative through
its transformation into property  


cassiodorus said of property  that it was the only safe harbor in
which to seek shelter from the tempests of chicanery and the gales of
avarice   hic unus inter humanas pro cellas portus  quem si homines
fervida voluntate praeterierint  in undosis semper jurgiis errabunt  

thus  in the opinion of the authors  prescription is a means of
preserving public order  a restoration in certain cases of the original
mode of acquiring property  a fiction of the civil law which derives
all its force from the necessity of settling differences which otherwise
would never end  for  as grotius says  time has no power to produce
effects  all things happen in time  but nothing is done by time 
prescription  or the right of acquisition through the lapse of time  is 
therefore  a fiction of the law  conventionally adopted 

but all property necessarily originated in prescription  or  as the
latins say  in  usucapion   that is  in continued possession 

i ask  then  in the first place  how possession can become property by
the lapse of time  continue possession as long as you wish  continue
it for years and for centuries  you never can give duration  which of
itself creates nothing  changes nothing  modifies nothing  the power
to change the usufructuary into a proprietor  let the civil law secure
against chance comers the honest possessor who has held his position
for many years   that only confirms a right already respected  and
prescription  applied in this way  simply means that possession which
has continued for twenty  thirty  or a hundred years shall be retained
by the occupant  but when the law declares that the lapse of time
changes possessor into proprietor  it supposes that a right can be
created without a producing cause  it unwarrantably alters the character
of the subject  it legislates on a matter not open to legislation  it
exceeds its own powers  public order and private security ask only
that possession shall be protected  why has the law created property 
prescription was simply security for the future  why has the law made it
a matter of privilege 

thus the origin of prescription is identical with that of property
itself  and since the latter can legitimate itself only when accompanied
by equality  prescription is but another of the thousand forms which the
necessity of maintaining this precious equality has taken  and this is
no vain induction  no far fetched inference  the proof is written in all
the codes 

and  indeed  if all nations  through their instinct of justice and their
conservative nature  have recognized the utility and the necessity
of prescription  and if their design has been to guard thereby the
interests of the possessor   could they not do something for the absent
citizen  separated from his family and his country by commerce  war  or
captivity  and in no position to exercise his right of possession  no 
also  at the same time that prescription was introduced into the laws 
it was admitted that property is preserved by intent alone    nudo
animo   now  if property is preserved by intent alone  if it can be
lost only by the action of the proprietor  what can be the use of
prescription  how does the law dare to presume that the proprietor  who
preserves by intent alone  intended to abandon that which he has allowed
to be prescribed  what lapse of time can warrant such a conjecture 
and by what right does the law punish the absence of the proprietor by
depriving him of his goods  what then  we found but a moment since that
prescription and property were identical  and now we find that they are
mutually destructive 

grotius  who perceived this difficulty  replied so singularly that his
words deserve to be quoted   bene sperandum de hominibus  ac propterea
non putandum eos hoc esse animo ut  rei caducae causa  hominem alterum
velint in perpetuo peccato versari  quo d evitari saepe non poterit sine
tali derelictione  

 where is the man   he says   with so unchristian a soul that  for a
trifle  he would perpetuate the trespass of a possessor  which would
inevitably be the result if he did not consent to abandon his right   by
the eternal  i am that man  though a million proprietors should burn for
it in hell  i lay the blame on them for depriving me of my portion of
this world s goods  to this powerful consideration grotius rejoins  that
it is better to abandon a disputed right than to go to law  disturb the
peace of nations  and stir up the flames of civil war  i accept  if you
wish it  this argument  provided you indemnify me  but if this indemnity
is refused me  what do i  a proletaire  care for the tranquillity and
security of the rich  i care as little for public order as for the
proprietor s safety  i ask to live a laborer  otherwise i will die a
warrior 

whichever way we turn  we shall come to the conclusion that prescription
is a contradiction of property  or rather that prescription and property
are two forms of the same principle  but two forms which serve to
correct each other  and ancient and modern jurisprudence did not make
the least of its blunders in pretending to reconcile them  indeed  if
we see in the institution of property only a desire to secure to
each individual his share of the soil and his right to labor  in the
distinction between naked property and possession only an asylum for
absentees  orphans  and all who do not know  or cannot maintain  their
rights  in prescription only a means  either of defence against unjust
pretensions and encroachments  or of settlement of the differences
caused by the removal of possessors   we shall recognize in these
various forms of human justice the spontaneous efforts of the mind to
come to the aid of the social instinct  we shall see in this protection
of all rights the sentiment of equality  a constant levelling tendency 
and  looking deeper  we shall find in the very exaggeration of these
principles the confirmation of our doctrine  because  if equality of
conditions and universal association are not soon realized  it will be
owing to the obstacle thrown for the time in the way of the common sense
of the people by the stupidity of legislators and judges  and also to
the fact that  while society in its original state was illuminated with
a flash of truth  the early speculations of its leaders could bring
forth nothing but darkness 

after the first covenants  after the first draughts of laws and
constitutions  which were the expression of man s primary needs  the
legislator s duty was to reform the errors of legislation  to complete
that which was defective  to harmonize  by superior definitions  those
things which seemed to conflict  instead of that  they halted at the
literal meaning of the laws  content to play the subordinate part of
commentators and scholiasts  taking the inspirations of the human mind 
at that time necessarily weak and faulty  for axioms of eternal and
unquestionable truth   influenced by public opinion  enslaved by the
popular religion   they have invariably started with the principle
 following in this respect the example of the theologians  that that is
infallibly true which has been admitted by all persons  in all places 
and at all times   quod ab omnibus  quod ubique  quod semper   as if a
general but spontaneous opinion was any thing more than an indication of
the truth  let us not be deceived  the opinion of all nations may serve
to authenticate the perception of a fact  the vague sentiment of a law 
it can teach us nothing about either fact or law  the consent of mankind
is an indication of nature  not  as cicero says  a law of nature  under
the indication is hidden the truth  which faith can believe  but only
thought can know  such has been the constant progress of the human mind
in regard to physical phenomena and the creations of genius  how can
it be otherwise with the facts of conscience and the rules of human
conduct 



  4   labor  that labor has no inherent power to appropriate natural
wealth 


we shall show by the maxims of political economy and law  that is  by
the authorities recognized by property   

1  that labor has no inherent power to appropriate natural wealth 

2  that  if we admit that labor has this power  we are led directly to
equality of property   whatever the kind of labor  however scarce the
product  or unequal the ability of the laborers 

3  that  in the order of justice  labor destroys property 

following the example of our opponents  and that we may leave no
obstacles in the path  let us examine the question in the strongest
possible light 

m  ch  comte says  in his  treatise on property    


 france  considered as a nation  has a territory which is her own  


france  as an individuality  possesses a territory which she cultivates 
it is not her property  nations are related to each other as individuals
are  they are commoners and workers  it is an abuse of language to call
them proprietors  the right of use and abuse belongs no more to nations
than to men  and the time will come when a war waged for the purpose of
checking a nation in its abuse of the soil will be regarded as a holy
war 

thus  m  ch  comte  who undertakes to explain how property comes into
existence  and who starts with the supposition that a nation is a
proprietor  falls into that error known as begging the question  a
mistake which vitiates his whole argument 

if the reader thinks it is pushing logic too far to question a nation s
right of property in the territory which it possesses  i will simply
remind him of the fact that at all ages the results of the fictitious
right of national property have been pretensions to suzerainty 
tributes  monarchical privileges  statute labor  quotas of men and
money  supplies of merchandise  &c   ending finally in refusals to pay
taxes  insurrections  wars  and depopulations 


 scattered through this territory are extended tracts of land  which
have not been converted into individual property  these lands  which
consist mainly of forests  belong to the whole population  and the
government  which receives the revenues  uses or ought to use them in
the interest of all  

ought to use is well said  a lie is avoided thereby 

 let them be offered for sale     


why offered for sale  who has a right to sell them  even were the nation
proprietor  can the generation of to day dispossess the generation of
to morrow  the nation  in its function of usufructuary  possesses
them  the government rules  superintends  and protects them  if it also
granted lands  it could grant only their use  it has no right to sell
them or transfer them in any way whatever  not being a proprietor  how
can it transmit property 


 suppose some industrious man buys a portion  a large swamp for example 
this would be no usurpation  since the public would receive the exact
value through the hands of the government  and would be as rich after
the sale as before  


how ridiculous  what  because a prodigal  imprudent  incompetent
official sells the state s possessions  while i  a ward of the state   i
who have neither an advisory nor a deliberative voice in the state
councils   while i am allowed to make no opposition to the sale 
this sale is right and legal  the guardians of the nation waste its
substance  and it has no redress  i have received  you tell me  through
the hands of the government my share of the proceeds of the sale  but 
in the first place  i did not wish to sell  and  had i wished to  i
could not have sold  i had not the right  and then i do not see that i
am benefited by the sale  my guardians have dressed up some soldiers 
repaired an old fortress  erected in their pride some costly but
worthless monument   then they have exploded some fireworks and set up a
greased pole  what does all that amount to in comparison with my loss 

the purchaser draws boundaries  fences himself in  and says   this is
mine  each one by himself  each one for himself   here  then  is a piece
of land upon which  henceforth  no one has a right to step  save
the proprietor and his friends  which can benefit nobody  save the
proprietor and his servants  let these sales multiply  and soon the
people  who have been neither able nor willing to sell  and who have
received none of the proceeds of the sale  will have nowhere to rest 
no place of shelter  no ground to till  they will die of hunger at
the proprietor s door  on the edge of that property which was their
birthright  and the proprietor  watching them die  will exclaim   so
perish idlers and vagrants  

to reconcile us to the proprietor s usurpation  m  ch  comte assumes the
lands to be of little value at the time of sale 


 the importance of these usurpations should not be exaggerated  they
should be measured by the number of men which the occupied land would
support  and by the means which it would furnish them 

 it is evident  for instance  that if a piece of land which is worth
to day one thousand francs was worth only five centimes when it was
usurped  we really lose only the value of five centimes  a square league
of earth would be hardly sufficient to support a savage in distress 
to day it supplies one thousand persons with the means of existence 
nine hundred and ninety nine parts of this land is the legitimate
property of the possessors  only one thousandth of the value has been
usurped  


a peasant admitted one day  at confession  that he had destroyed a
document which declared him a debtor to the amount of three hundred
francs  said the father confessor   you must return these three hundred
francs    no   replied the peasant   i will return a penny to pay for
the paper  

m  ch  comte s logic resembles this peasant s honesty  the soil has not
only an integrant and actual value  it has also a potential value   a
value of the future   which depends on our ability to make it valuable 
and to employ it in our work  destroy a bill of exchange  a promissory
note  an annuity deed   as a paper you destroy almost no value at all 
but with this paper you destroy your title  and  in losing your title 
you deprive yourself of your goods  destroy the land  or  what is the
same thing  sell it   you not only transfer one  two  or several crops 
but you annihilate all the products that you could derive from it  you
and your children and your children s children 

when m  ch  comte  the apostle of property and the eulogist of labor 
supposes an alienation of the soil on the part of the government  we
must not think that he does so without reason and for no purpose  it
is a necessary part of his position  as he rejected the theory of
occupancy  and as he knew  moreover  that labor could not constitute the
right in the absence of a previous permission to occupy  he was obliged
to connect this permission with the authority of the government  which
means that property is based upon the sovereignty of the people 
in other words  upon universal consent  this theory we have already
considered 

to say that property is the daughter of labor  and then to give labor
material on which to exercise itself  is  if i am not mistaken  to
reason in a circle  contradictions will result from it 


 a piece of land of a certain size produces food enough to supply a man
for one day  if the possessor  through his labor  discovers some method
of making it produce enough for two days  he doubles its value  this
new value is his work  his creation  it is taken from nobody  it is his
property  


i maintain that the possessor is paid for his trouble and industry in
his doubled crop  but that he acquires no right to the land   let
the laborer have the fruits of his labor   very good  but i do not
understand that property in products carries with it property in raw
material  does the skill of the fisherman  who on the same coast
can catch more fish than his fellows  make him proprietor of the
fishing grounds  can the expertness of a hunter ever be regarded as
a property title to a game forest  the analogy is perfect   the
industrious cultivator finds the reward of his industry in the abundancy
and superiority of his crop  if he has made improvements in the soil  he
has the possessor s right of preference  never  under any circumstances 
can he be allowed to claim a property title to the soil which he
cultivates  on the ground of his skill as a cultivator 

to change possession into property  something is needed besides labor 
without which a man would cease to be proprietor as soon as he ceased
to be a laborer  now  the law bases property upon immemorial 
unquestionable possession  that is  prescription  labor is only the
sensible sign  the physical act  by which occupation is manifested  if 
then  the cultivator remains proprietor after he has ceased to labor
and produce  if his possession  first conceded  then tolerated  finally
becomes inalienable   it happens by permission of the civil law  and by
virtue of the principle of occupancy  so true is this  that there is not
a bill of sale  not a farm lease  not an annuity  but implies it  i will
quote only one example 

how do we measure the value of land  by its product  if a piece of land
yields one thousand francs  we say that at five per cent  it is worth
twenty thousand francs  at four per cent  twenty five thousand francs 
&c   which means  in other words  that in twenty or twenty five years 
time the purchaser would recover in full the amount originally paid for
the land  if  then  after a certain length of time  the price of a piece
of land has been wholly recovered  why does the purchaser continue to be
proprietor  because of the right of occupancy  in the absence of which
every sale would be a redemption 

the theory of appropriation by labor is  then  a contradiction of the
code  and when the partisans of this theory pretend to explain the laws
thereby  they contradict themselves 


 if men succeed in fertilizing land hitherto unproductive  or even
death producing  like certain swamps  they create thereby property in
all its completeness  


what good does it do to magnify an expression  and play with
equivocations  as if we expected to change the reality thereby  they
create property in all its completeness  you mean that they create a
productive capacity which formerly did not exist  but this capacity
cannot be created without material to support it  the substance of the
soil remains the same  only its qualities and modifications are changed 
man has created every thing  every thing save the material itself  now 
i maintain that this material he can only possess and use  on condition
of permanent labor   granting  for the time being  his right of property
in things which he has produced 

this  then  is the first point settled  property in product  if we grant
so much  does not carry with it property in the means of production 
that seems to me to need no further demonstration  there is no
difference between the soldier who possesses his arms  the mason
who possesses the materials committed to his care  the fisherman who
possesses the water  the hunter who possesses the fields and forests 
and the cultivator who possesses the lands  all  if you say so  are
proprietors of their products  not one is proprietor of the means of
production  the right to product is exclusive  jus in re  the right to
means is common  jus ad rem 



  5   that labor leads to equality of property 

admit  however  that labor gives a right of property in material 

why is not this principle universal  why is the benefit of this
pretended law confined to a few and denied to the mass of laborers 
a philosopher  arguing that all animals sprang up formerly out of the
earth warmed by the rays of the sun  almost like mushrooms  on being
asked why the earth no longer yielded crops of that nature  replied 
 because it is old  and has lost its fertility   has labor  once so
fecund  likewise become sterile  why does the tenant no longer acquire
through his labor the land which was formerly acquired by the labor of
the proprietor 

 because   they say   it is already appropriated   that is no answer  a
farm yields fifty bushels per hectare  the skill and labor of the tenant
double this product  the increase is created by the tenant  suppose the
owner  in a spirit of moderation rarely met with  does not go to the
extent of absorbing this product by raising the rent  but allows the
cultivator to enjoy the results of his labor  even then justice is not
satisfied  the tenant  by improving the land  has imparted a new value
to the property  he  therefore  has a right to a part of the property 
if the farm was originally worth one hundred thousand francs  and if
by the labor of the tenant its value has risen to one hundred and fifty
thousand francs  the tenant  who produced this extra value  is the
legitimate proprietor of one third of the farm  m  ch  comte could not
have pronounced this doctrine false  for it was he who said   


 men who increase the fertility of the earth are no less useful to their
fellow men  than if they should create new land  


why  then  is not this rule applicable to the man who improves the land 
as well as to him who clears it  the labor of the former makes the land
worth one  that of the latter makes it worth two  both create equal
values  why not accord to both equal property  i defy any one to
refute this argument  without again falling back on the right of first
occupancy 

 but   it will be said   even if your wish should be granted  property
would not be distributed much more evenly than now  land does not go on
increasing in value for ever  after two or three seasons it attains its
maximum fertility  that which is added by the agricultural art results
rather from the progress of science and the diffusion of knowledge  than
from the skill of the cultivator  consequently  the addition of a
few laborers to the mass of proprietors would be no argument against
property  

this discussion would  indeed  prove a well nigh useless one  if our
labors culminated in simply extending land privilege and industrial
monopoly  in emancipating only a few hundred laborers out of the
millions of proletaires  but this also is a misconception of our real
thought  and does but prove the general lack of intelligence and logic 

if the laborer  who adds to the value of a thing  has a right of
property in it  he who maintains this value acquires the same right 
for what is maintenance  it is incessant addition   continuous creation 
what is it to cultivate  it is to give the soil its value every year 
it is  by annually renewed creation  to prevent the diminution or
destruction of the value of a piece of land  admitting  then  that
property is rational and legitimate   admitting that rent is equitable
and just   i say that he who cultivates acquires property by as good a
title as he who clears  or he who improves  and that every time a tenant
pays his rent  he obtains a fraction of property in the land entrusted
to his care  the denominator of which is equal to the proportion of rent
paid  unless you admit this  you fall into absolutism and tyranny  you
recognize class privileges  you sanction slavery 

whoever labors becomes a proprietor  this is an inevitable deduction
from the acknowledged principles of political economy and jurisprudence 
and when i say proprietor  i do not mean simply  as do our hypocritical
economists  proprietor of his allowance  his salary  his wages   i mean
proprietor of the value which he creates  and by which the master alone
profits 

as all this relates to the theory of wages and of the distribution of
products   and as this matter never has been even partially cleared
up   i ask permission to insist on it  this discussion will not
be useless to the work in hand  many persons talk of admitting
working people to a share in the products and profits  but in
their minds this participation is pure benevolence  they have never
shown  perhaps never suspected  that it was a natural  necessary right 
inherent in labor  and inseparable from the function of producer  even
in the lowest forms of his work 

this is my proposition  the laborer retains  even after he has received
his wages  a natural right of property in the thing which he has
produced 

i again quote m  ch  comte   

 some laborers are employed in draining marshes  in cutting down trees
and brushwood   in a word  in cleaning up the soil  they increase the
value  they make the amount of property larger  they are paid for
the value which they add in the form of food and daily wages  it then
becomes the property of the capitalist  


the price is not sufficient  the labor of the workers has created a
value  now this value is their property  but they have neither sold
nor exchanged it  and you  capitalist  you have not earned it  that you
should have a partial right to the whole  in return for the materials
that you have furnished and the provisions that you have supplied  is
perfectly just  you contributed to the production  you ought to share in
the enjoyment  but your right does not annihilate that of the laborers 
who  in spite of you  have been your colleagues in the work of
production  why do you talk of wages  the money with which you pay
the wages of the laborers remunerates them for only a few years of the
perpetual possession which they have abandoned to you  wages is the cost
of the daily maintenance and refreshment of the laborer  you are wrong
in calling it the price of a sale  the workingman has sold nothing  he
knows neither his right  nor the extent of the concession which he has
made to you  nor the meaning of the contract which you pretend to
have made with him  on his side  utter ignorance  on yours  error and
surprise  not to say deceit and fraud 

let us make this clearer by another and more striking example 

no one is ignorant of the difficulties that are met with in the
conversion of untilled land into arable and productive land  these
difficulties are so great  that usually an isolated man would perish
before he could put the soil in a condition to yield him even the most
meagre living  to that end are needed the united and combined efforts of
society  and all the resources of industry  m  ch  comte quotes on this
subject numerous and well authenticated facts  little thinking that he
is amassing testimony against his own system 

let us suppose that a colony of twenty or thirty families establishes
itself in a wild district  covered with underbrush and forests  and from
which  by agreement  the natives consent to withdraw  each one of these
families possesses a moderate but sufficient amount of capital  of such
a nature as a colonist would be apt to choose   animals  seeds  tools 
and a little money and food  the land having been divided  each one
settles himself as comfortably as possible  and begins to clear away the
portion allotted to him  but after a few weeks of fatigue  such as they
never before have known  of inconceivable suffering  of ruinous and
almost useless labor  our colonists begin to complain of their trade 
their condition seems hard to them  they curse their sad existence 

suddenly  one of the shrewdest among them kills a pig  cures a part of
the meat  and  resolved to sacrifice the rest of his provisions  goes to
find his companions in misery   friends   he begins in a very benevolent
tone   how much trouble it costs you to do a little work and live
uncomfortably  a fortnight of labor has reduced you to your last
extremity     let us make an arrangement by which you shall all profit 
i offer you provisions and wine  you shall get so much every day 
we will work together  and  zounds  my friends  we will be happy and
contented  

would it be possible for empty stomachs to resist such an invitation 
the hungriest of them follow the treacherous tempter  they go to work 
the charm of society  emulation  joy  and mutual assistance double their
strength  the work can be seen to advance  singing and laughing  they
subdue nature  in a short time  the soil is thoroughly changed  the
mellowed earth waits only for the seed  that done  the proprietor pays
his laborers  who  on going away  return him their thanks  and grieve
that the happy days which they have spent with him are over 

others follow this example  always with the same success  then  these
installed  the rest disperse   each one returns to his grubbing  but 
while grubbing  it is necessary to live  while they have been clearing
away for their neighbor  they have done no clearing for themselves  one
year s seed time and harvest is already gone  they had calculated that
in lending their labor they could not but gain  since they would save
their own provisions  and  while living better  would get still more
money  false calculation  they have created for another the means
wherewith to produce  and have created nothing for themselves  the
difficulties of clearing remain the same  their clothing wears out 
their provisions give out  soon their purse becomes empty for the profit
of the individual for whom they have worked  and who alone can furnish
the provisions which they need  since he alone is in a position to
produce them  then  when the poor grubber has exhausted his resources 
the man with the provisions  like the wolf in the fable  who scents his
victim from afar  again comes forward  one he offers to employ again by
the day  from another he offers to buy at a favorable price a piece of
his bad land  which is not  and never can be  of any use to him  that
is  he uses the labor of one man to cultivate the field of another
for his own benefit  so that at the end of twenty years  of thirty
individuals originally equal in point of wealth  five or six have
become proprietors of the whole district  while the rest have been
philanthropically dispossessed 

in this century of bourgeoisie morality  in which i have had the honor
to be born  the moral sense is so debased that i should not be at all
surprised if i were asked  by many a worthy proprietor  what i see
in this that is unjust and illegitimate  debased creature  galvanized
corpse  how can i expect to convince you  if you cannot tell robbery
when i show it to you  a man  by soft and insinuating words  discovers
the secret of taxing others that he may establish himself  then  once
enriched by their united efforts  he refuses  on the very conditions
which he himself dictated  to advance the well being of those who made
his fortune for him  and you ask how such conduct is fraudulent  under
the pretext that he has paid his laborers  that he owes them nothing
more  that he has nothing to gain by putting himself at the service of
others  while his own occupations claim his attention   he refuses  i
say  to aid others in getting a foothold  as he was aided in getting his
own  and when  in the impotence of their isolation  these poor laborers
are compelled to sell their birthright  he  this ungrateful proprietor 
this knavish upstart  stands ready to put the finishing touch to their
deprivation and their ruin  and you think that just  take care 

i read in your startled countenance the reproach of a guilty conscience 
much more clearly than the innocent astonishment of involuntary
ignorance 

 the capitalist   they say   has paid the laborers their daily wages  
to be accurate  it must be said that the capitalist has paid as many
times one day s wage as he has employed laborers each day   which is not
at all the same thing  for he has paid nothing for that immense
power which results from the union and harmony of laborers  and
the convergence and simultaneousness of their efforts  two hundred
grenadiers stood the obelisk of luxor upon its base in a few hours  do
you suppose that one man could have accomplished the same task in two
hundred days  nevertheless  on the books of the capitalist  the amount
of wages paid would have been the same  well  a desert to prepare for
cultivation  a house to build  a factory to run   all these are
obelisks to erect  mountains to move  the smallest fortune  the most
insignificant establishment  the setting in motion of the lowest
industry  demand the concurrence of so many different kinds of labor and
skill  that one man could not possibly execute the whole of them  it
is astonishing that the economists never have called attention to this
fact  strike a balance  then  between the capitalist s receipts and his
payments 

the laborer needs a salary which will enable him to live while he works 
for unless he consumes  he cannot produce  whoever employs a man owes
him maintenance and support  or wages enough to procure the same 
that is the first thing to be done in all production  i admit  for the
moment  that in this respect the capitalist has discharged his duty 

it is necessary that the laborer should find in his production  in
addition to his present support  a guarantee of his future support 
otherwise the source of production would dry up  and his productive
capacity would become exhausted  in other words  the labor accomplished
must give birth perpetually to new labor  such is the universal law of
reproduction  in this way  the proprietor of a farm finds  1  in his
crops  means  not only of supporting himself and his family  but of
maintaining and improving his capital  of feeding his live stock  in a
word  means of new labor and continual reproduction  2  in his ownership
of a productive agency  a permanent basis of cultivation and labor 

but he who lends his services   what is his basis of cultivation 

the proprietor s presumed need of him  and the unwarranted supposition
that he wishes to employ him  just as the commoner once held his land by
the munificence and condescension of the lord  so to day the working man
holds his labor by the condescension and necessities of the master
and proprietor  that is what is called possession by a precarious  15 
title  but this precarious condition is an injustice  for it implies
an inequality in the bargain  the laborer s wages exceed but little his
running expenses  and do not assure him wages for to morrow  while the
capitalist finds in the instrument produced by the laborer a pledge of
independence and security for the future 


now  this reproductive leaven  this eternal germ of life 
this preparation of the land and manufacture of implements for
production  constitutes the debt of the capitalist to the producer 
which he never pays  and it is this fraudulent denial which causes the
poverty of the laborer  the luxury of idleness  and the inequality of
conditions  this it is  above all other things  which has been so fitly
named the exploitation of man by man 

one of three things must be done  either the laborer must be given a
portion of the product in addition to his wages  or the employer must
render the laborer an equivalent in productive service  or else he
must pledge himself to employ him for ever  division of the product 
reciprocity of service  or guarantee of perpetual labor   from the
adoption of one of these courses the capitalist cannot escape  but it
is evident that he cannot satisfy the second and third of these
conditions  he can neither put himself at the service of the thousands
of working men  who  directly or indirectly  have aided him in
establishing himself  nor employ them all for ever  he has no other
course left him  then  but a division of the property  but if the
property is divided  all conditions will be equal  there will be no more
large capitalists or large proprietors 

consequently  when m  ch  comte  following out his hypothesis  shows
us his capitalist acquiring one after another the products of his
employees  labor  he sinks deeper and deeper into the mire  and  as his
argument does not change  our reply of course remains the same 


 other laborers are employed in building  some quarry the stone  others
transport it  others cut it  and still others put it in place  each
of them adds a certain value to the material which passes through his
hands  and this value  the product of his labor  is his property  he
sells it  as fast as he creates it  to the proprietor of the building 
who pays him for it in food and wages  


 divide et impera   divide  and you shall command  divide  and you
shall grow rich  divide  and you shall deceive men  you shall daze their
minds  you shall mock at justice  separate laborers from each other 
perhaps each one s daily wage exceeds the value of each individual s
product  but that is not the question under consideration  a force of
one thousand men working twenty days has been paid the same wages that
one would be paid for working fifty five years  but this force of
one thousand has done in twenty days what a single man could not have
accomplished  though he had labored for a million centuries  is the
exchange an equitable one  once more  no  when you have paid all the
individual forces  the collective force still remains to be paid 

consequently  there remains always a right of collective property which
you have not acquired  and which you enjoy unjustly 

admit that twenty days  wages suffice to feed  lodge  and clothe this
multitude for twenty days  thrown out of employment at the end of that
time  what will become of them  if  as fast as they create  they abandon
their creations to the proprietors who will soon discharge them  while
the proprietor  firm in his position  thanks to the aid of all the
laborers   dwells in security  and fears no lack of labor or bread 
the laborer s only dependence is upon the benevolence of this same
proprietor  to whom he has sold and surrendered his liberty  if  then 
the proprietor  shielding himself behind his comfort and his rights 
refuses to employ the laborer  how can the laborer live  he has ploughed
an excellent field  and cannot sow it  he has built an elegant and
commodious house  and cannot live in it  he has produced all  and can
enjoy nothing 

labor leads us to equality  every step that we take brings us nearer to
it  and if laborers had equal strength  diligence  and industry  clearly
their fortunes would be equal also  indeed  if  as is pretended   and
as we have admitted   the laborer is proprietor of the value which he
creates  it follows   

1  that the laborer acquires at the expense of the idle proprietor 

2  that all production being necessarily collective  the laborer is
entitled to a share of the products and profits commensurate with his
labor 

3  that all accumulated capital being social property  no one can be its
exclusive proprietor 

these inferences are unavoidable  these alone would suffice to
revolutionize our whole economical system  and change our institutions
and our laws  why do the very persons  who laid down this principle  now
refuse to be guided by it  why do the says  the comtes  the hennequins 
and others  after having said that property is born of labor  seek to
fix it by occupation and prescription 

but let us leave these sophists to their contradictions and blindness 
the good sense of the people will do justice to their equivocations 
let us make haste to enlighten it  and show it the true path  equality
approaches  already between it and us but a short distance intervenes 
to morrow even this distance will have been traversed 



  6   that in society all wages are equal 

when the st  simonians  the fourierists  and  in general  all who in our
day are connected with social economy and reform  inscribe upon their
banner   


 to each according to his capacity  to each capacity according to its
results   st  simon  

 to each according to his capital  his labor  and his skill 
 fourier    

they mean  although they do not say so in so many words  that the
products of nature procured by labor and industry are a reward  a palm 
a crown offered to all kinds of preeminence and superiority  they regard
the land as an immense arena in which prizes are contended for   no
longer  it is true  with lances and swords  by force and by treachery 
but by acquired wealth  by knowledge  talent  and by virtue itself  in
a word  they mean  and everybody agrees with them  that the greatest
capacity is entitled to the greatest reward  and  to use the
mercantile phraseology   which has  at least  the merit of being
straightforward   that salaries must be governed by capacity and its
results 

the disciples of these two self styled reformers cannot deny that such
is their thought  for  in doing so  they would contradict their
official interpretations  and would destroy the unity of their systems 
furthermore  such a denial on their part is not to be feared  the
two sects glory in laying down as a principle inequality of
conditions   reasoning from nature  who  they say  intended the
inequality of capacities  they boast only of one thing  namely  that
their political system is so perfect  that the social inequalities
always correspond with the natural inequalities  they no more trouble
themselves to inquire whether inequality of conditions  i mean of
salaries  is possible  than they do to fix a measure of capacity  1 

 1  in st  simon s system  the st  simonian priest determines the
capacity of each by virtue of his pontifical infallibility  in imitation
of the roman church  in fourier s  the ranks and merits are decided by
vote  in imitation of the constitutional regime 

clearly  the great man is an object of ridicule to the reader  he did
not mean to tell his secret 


 to each according to his capacity  to each capacity according to its
results  

 to each according to his capital  his labor  and his skill  


since the death of st  simon and fourier  not one among their numerous
disciples has attempted to give to the public a scientific demonstration
of this grand maxim  and i would wager a hundred to one that no
fourierist even suspects that this biform aphorism is susceptible of two
interpretations 


 to each according to his capacity  to each capacity according to its
results  

 to each according to his capital  his labor  and his skill  


this proposition  taken  as they say   in sensu obvio   in the sense
usually attributed to it  is false  absurd  unjust  contradictory 
hostile to liberty  friendly to tyranny  anti social  and was unluckily
framed under the express influence of the property idea 

and  first  capital must be crossed off the list of elements which are
entitled to a reward  the fourierists  as far as i have been able to
learn from a few of their pamphlets  deny the right of occupancy  and
recognize no basis of property save labor  starting with a like premise 
they would have seen  had they reasoned upon the matter  that capital is
a source of production to its proprietor only by virtue of the right of
occupancy  and that this production is therefore illegitimate  indeed 
if labor is the sole basis of property  i cease to be proprietor of my
field as soon as i receive rent for it from another  this we have
shown beyond all cavil  it is the same with all capital  so that to put
capital in an enterprise  is  by the law s decision  to exchange it
for an equivalent sum in products  i will not enter again upon this
now useless discussion  since i propose  in the following chapter  to
exhaust the subject of production by capital 

thus  capital can be exchanged  but cannot be a source of income 

labor and skill remain  or  as st  simon puts it  results and
capacities  i will examine them successively 

should wages be governed by labor  in other words  is it just that
he who does the most should get the most  i beg the reader to pay the
closest attention to this point 

to solve the problem with one stroke  we have only to ask ourselves
the following question   is labor a condition or a struggle   the reply
seems plain 

god said to man   in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread    that
is  thou shalt produce thy own bread  with more or less ease  according
to thy skill in directing and combining thy efforts  thou shalt labor 
god did not say   thou shalt quarrel with thy neighbor for thy bread  
but   thou shalt labor by the side of thy neighbor  and ye shall dwell
together in harmony   let us develop the meaning of this law  the
extreme simplicity of which renders it liable to misconstruction 

in labor  two things must be noticed and distinguished  association and
available material 

in so far as laborers are associated  they are equal  and it involves a
contradiction to say that one should be paid more than another  for 
as the product of one laborer can be paid for only in the product of
another laborer  if the two products are unequal  the remainder  or the
difference between the greater and the smaller  will not be acquired
by society  and  therefore  not being exchanged  will not affect the
equality of wages  there will result  it is true  in favor of the
stronger laborer a natural inequality  but not a social inequality  no
one having suffered by his strength and productive energy  in a word 
society exchanges only equal products  that is  rewards no labor save
that performed for her benefit  consequently  she pays all laborers
equally  with what they produce outside of her sphere she has no more to
do  than with the difference in their voices and their hair 

i seem to be positing the principle of inequality  the reverse of this
is the truth  the total amount of labor which can be performed for
society  that is  of labor susceptible of exchange   being  within a
given space  as much greater as the laborers are more numerous  and as
the task assigned to each is less in magnitude   it follows that natural
inequality neutralizes itself in proportion as association extends  and
as the quantity of consumable values produced thereby increases  so that
in society the only thing which could bring back the inequality of labor
would be the right of occupancy   the right of property 

now  suppose that this daily social task consists in the ploughing 
hoeing  or reaping of two square decameters  and that the average time
required to accomplish it is seven hours  one laborer will finish it in
six hours  another will require eight  the majority  however  will work
seven  but provided each one furnishes the quantity of labor demanded of
him  whatever be the time he employs  they are entitled to equal wages 

shall the laborer who is capable of finishing his task in six hours have
the right  on the ground of superior strength and activity  to usurp
the task of the less skilful laborer  and thus rob him of his labor and
bread  who dares maintain such a proposition  he who finishes before the
others may rest  if he chooses  he may devote himself to useful exercise
and labors for the maintenance of his strength  and the culture of his
mind  and the pleasure of his life  this he can do without injury to any
one  but let him confine himself to services which affect him solely 
vigor  genius  diligence  and all the personal advantages which result
therefrom  are the work of nature and  to a certain extent  of the
individual  society awards them the esteem which they merit  but the
wages which it pays them is measured  not by their power  but by their
production  now  the product of each is limited by the right of all 

if the soil were infinite in extent  and the amount of available
material were exhaustless  even then we could not accept this maxim   to
each according to his labor  and why  because society  i repeat 
whatever be the number of its subjects  is forced to pay them all the
same wages  since she pays them only in their own products  only  on the
hypothesis just made  inasmuch as the strong cannot be prevented from
using all their advantages  the inconveniences of natural inequality
would reappear in the very bosom of social equality  but the land 
considering the productive power of its inhabitants and their ability to
multiply  is very limited  further  by the immense variety of products
and the extreme division of labor  the social task is made easy of
accomplishment  now  through this limitation of things producible  and
through the ease of producing them  the law of absolute equality takes
effect 

yes  life is a struggle  but this struggle is not between man and
man  it is between man and nature  and it is each one s duty to take
his share in it  if  in the struggle  the strong come to the aid of the
weak  their kindness deserves praise and love  but their aid must be
accepted as a free gift   not imposed by force  nor offered at a
price  all have the same career before them  neither too long nor too
difficult  whoever finishes it finds his reward at the end  it is not
necessary to get there first 

in printing offices  where the laborers usually work by the job  the
compositor receives so much per thousand letters set  the pressman so
much per thousand sheets printed  there  as elsewhere  inequalities
of talent and skill are to be found  when there is no prospect of dull
times  for printing and typesetting  like all other trades  sometimes
come to a stand still   every one is free to work his hardest  and exert
his faculties to the utmost  he who does more gets more  he who does
less gets less  when business slackens  compositors and pressmen divide
up their labor  all monopolists are detested as no better than robbers
or traitors 

there is a philosophy in the action of these printers  to which
neither economists nor legists have ever risen  if our legislators had
introduced into their codes the principle of distributive justice
which governs printing offices  if they had observed the popular
instincts   not for the sake of servile imitation  but in order to
reform and generalize them   long ere this liberty and equality would
have been established on an immovable basis  and we should not now
be disputing about the right of property and the necessity of social
distinctions 

it has been calculated that if labor were equally shared by the whole
number of able bodied individuals  the average working day of each
individual  in france  would not exceed five hours  this being so  how
can we presume to talk of the inequality of laborers  it is the labor of
robert macaire that causes inequality 

the principle  to each according to his labor  interpreted to mean  who
works most should receive most  is based  therefore  on two palpable
errors  one  an error in economy  that in the labor of society tasks
must necessarily be unequal  the other  an error in physics  that there
is no limit to the amount of producible things 

 but   it will be said   suppose there are some people who wish to
perform only half of their task      is that very embarrassing  probably
they are satisfied with half of their salary  paid according to the
labor that they had performed  of what could they complain  and what
injury would they do to others  in this sense  it is fair to apply the
maxim   to each according to his results  it is the law of equality
itself 

further  numerous difficulties  relative to the police system and the
organization of industry  might be raised here  i will reply to them all
with this one sentence   that they must all be solved by the principle
of equality  thus  some one might observe   here is a task which cannot
be postponed without detriment to production  ought society to suffer
from the negligence of a few  and will she not venture  out of respect
for the right of labor  to assure with her own hands the product which
they refuse her  in such a case  to whom will the salary belong  

to society  who will be allowed to perform the labor  either herself  or
through her representatives  but always in such a way that the general
equality shall never be violated  and that only the idler shall be
punished for his idleness  further  if society may not use excessive
severity towards her lazy members  she has a right  in self defence  to
guard against abuses 

but every industry needs  they will add  leaders  instructors 
superintendents  &c  will these be engaged in the general task  no 
since their task is to lead  instruct  and superintend  but they must be
chosen from the laborers by the laborers themselves  and must fulfil
the conditions of eligibility  it is the same with all public functions 
whether of administration or instruction 

then  article first of the universal constitution will be   

 the limited quantity of available material proves the necessity of
dividing the labor among the whole number of laborers  the capacity 
given to all  of accomplishing a social task   that is  an equal
task   and the impossibility of paying one laborer save in the products
of another  justify the equality of wages  



  7   that inequality of powers is the necessary condition of equality
of fortunes 

it is objected   and this objection constitutes the second part of the
st  simonian  and the third part of the fourierstic  maxims   

 that all kinds of labor cannot be executed with equal ease  some
require great superiority of skill and intelligence  and on this
superiority is based the price  the artist  the savant  the poet  the
statesman  are esteemed only because of their excellence  and this
excellence destroys all similitude between them and other men  in the
presence of these heights of science and genius the law of equality
disappears  now  if equality is not absolute  there is no equality 
from the poet we descend to the novelist  from the sculptor to the
stonecutter  from the architect to the mason  from the chemist to the
cook  &c  capacities are classified and subdivided into orders  genera 
and species  the extremes of talent are connected by intermediate
talents  humanity is a vast hierarchy  in which the individual estimates
himself by comparison  and fixes his price by the value placed upon his
product by the public  

this objection always has seemed a formidable one  it is the
stumbling block of the economists  as well as of the defenders of
equality  it has led the former into egregious blunders  and has caused
the latter to utter incredible platitudes  gracchus babeuf wished all
superiority to be stringently repressed  and even persecuted as a social
calamity  to establish his communistic edifice  he lowered all citizens
to the stature of the smallest  ignorant eclectics have been known to
object to the inequality of knowledge  and i should not be surprised if
some one should yet rebel against the inequality of virtue  aristotle
was banished  socrates drank the hemlock  epaminondas was called to
account  for having proved superior in intelligence and virtue to some
dissolute and foolish demagogues  such follies will be re enacted  so
long as the inequality of fortunes justifies a populace  blinded and
oppressed by the wealthy  in fearing the elevation of new tyrants to
power 

nothing seems more unnatural than that which we examine too closely  and
often nothing seems less like the truth than the truth itself  on the
other hand  according to j  j  rousseau   it takes a great deal of
philosophy to enable us to observe once what we see every day   and 
according to d alembert   the ordinary truths of life make but little
impression on men  unless their attention is especially called to them  
the father of the school of economists  say   from whom i borrow these
two quotations  might have profited by them  but he who laughs at the
blind should wear spectacles  and he who notices him is near sighted 

strange  that which has frightened so many minds is not  after all 
an objection to equality  it is the very condition on which equality
exists    

natural inequality the condition of equality of fortunes     what
a paradox     i repeat my assertion  that no one may think i have
blundered  inequality of powers is the sine qua non of equality of
fortunes 

there are two things to be considered in society  functions and
relations 

i  functions  every laborer is supposed to be capable of performing the
task assigned to him  or  to use a common expression   every workman
must know his trade   the workman equal to his work   there is an
equation between functionary and function 

in society  functions are not alike  there must be  then  different
capacities  further   certain functions demand greater intelligence
and powers  then there are people of superior mind and talent  for
the performance of work necessarily involves a workman  from the need
springs the idea  and the idea makes the producer  we only know what our
senses long for and our intelligence demands  we have no keen desire
for things of which we cannot conceive  and the greater our powers of
conception  the greater our capabilities of production 

thus  functions arising from needs  needs from desires  and desires
from spontaneous perception and imagination  the same intelligence which
imagines can also produce  consequently  no labor is superior to the
laborer  in a word  if the function calls out the functionary  it is
because the functionary exists before the function 

let us admire nature s economy  with regard to these various needs which
she has given us  and which the isolated man cannot satisfy unaided 
nature has granted to the race a power refused to the individual  this
gives rise to the principle of the division of labor   a principle
founded on the speciality of vocations 

the satisfaction of some needs demands of man continual creation 
while others can  by the labor of a single individual  be satisfied for
millions of men through thousands of centuries  for example  the need of
clothing and food requires perpetual reproduction  while a knowledge
of the system of the universe may be acquired for ever by two or
three highly gifted men  the perpetual current of rivers supports our
commerce  and runs our machinery  but the sun  alone in the midst of
space  gives light to the whole world  nature  who might create
platos and virgils  newtons and cuviers  as she creates husbandmen and
shepherds  does not see fit to do so  choosing rather to proportion the
rarity of genius to the duration of its products  and to balance the
number of capacities by the competency of each one of them 

i do not inquire here whether the distance which separates one man from
another  in point of talent and intelligence  arises from the deplorable
condition of civilization  nor whether that which is now called the
inequality of powers would be in an ideal society any thing more than
a diversity of powers  i take the worst view of the matter  and  that
i may not be accused of tergiversation and evasion of difficulties  i
acknowledge all the inequalities that any one can desire   16 


certain philosophers  in love with the levelling idea  maintain that all
minds are equal  and that all differences are the result of education 
i am no believer  i confess  in this doctrine  which  even if it were
true  would lead to a result directly opposite to that desired  for  if
capacities are equal  whatever be the degree of their power  as no one
can be coerced   there are functions deemed coarse  low  and degrading 
which deserve higher pay   a result no less repugnant to equality than
to the principle  to each capacity according to its results  give me 
on the contrary  a society in which every kind of talent bears a proper
numerical relation to the needs of the society  and which demands from
each producer only that which his special function requires him to
produce  and  without impairing in the least the hierarchy of functions 
i will deduce the equality of fortunes 

this is my second point 

ii  relations  in considering the element of labor  i have shown that in
the same class of productive services  the capacity to perform a social
task being possessed by all  no inequality of reward can be based upon
an inequality of individual powers  however  it is but fair to say that
certain capacities seem quite incapable of certain services  so that  if
human industry were entirely confined to one class of products  numerous
incapacities would arise  and  consequently  the greatest social
inequality  but every body sees  without any hint from me  that the
variety of industries avoids this difficulty  so clear is this that
i shall not stop to discuss it  we have only to prove  then  that
functions are equal to each other  just as laborers  who perform the
same function  are equal to each other 


property makes man a eunuch  and then reproaches him for being nothing
but dry wood  a decaying tree 

are you astonished that i refuse to genius  to knowledge  to
courage   in a word  to all the excellences admired by the world   the
homage of dignities  the distinctions of power and wealth  it is not i
who refuse it  it is economy  it is justice  it is liberty  liberty  for
the first time in this discussion i appeal to her  let her rise in her
own defence  and achieve her victory 

every transaction ending in an exchange of products or services may be
designated as a commercial operation 

whoever says commerce  says exchange of equal values  for  if the values
are not equal  and the injured party perceives it  he will not consent
to the exchange  and there will be no commerce 

commerce exists only among free men  transactions may be effected
between other people by violence or fraud  but there is no commerce 

a free man is one who enjoys the use of his reason and his faculties 
who is neither blinded by passion  nor hindered or driven by oppression 
nor deceived by erroneous opinions 

so  in every exchange  there is a moral obligation that neither of the
contracting parties shall gain at the expense of the other  that is 
that  to be legitimate and true  commerce must be exempt from all
inequality  this is the first condition of commerce  its second
condition is  that it be voluntary  that is  that the parties act freely
and openly 

i define  then  commerce or exchange as an act of society 

the negro who sells his wife for a knife  his children for some bits
of glass  and finally himself for a bottle of brandy  is not free  the
dealer in human flesh  with whom he negotiates  is not his associate  he
is his enemy 

the civilized laborer who bakes a loaf that he may eat a slice of bread 
who builds a palace that he may sleep in a stable  who weaves rich
fabrics that he may dress in rags  who produces every thing that he may
dispense with every thing   is not free  his employer  not becoming
his associate in the exchange of salaries or services which takes place
between them  is his enemy 

the soldier who serves his country through fear instead of through love
is not free  his comrades and his officers  the ministers or organs of
military justice  are all his enemies 

the peasant who hires land  the manufacturer who borrows capital  the
tax payer who pays tolls  duties  patent and license fees  personal and
property taxes  &c   and the deputy who votes for them   all act
neither intelligently nor freely  their enemies are the proprietors  the
capitalists  the government 

give men liberty  enlighten their minds that they may know the meaning
of their contracts  and you will see the most perfect equality in
exchanges without regard to superiority of talent and knowledge  and
you will admit that in commercial affairs  that is  in the sphere of
society  the word superiority is void of sense 

let homer sing his verse  i listen to this sublime genius in comparison
with whom i  a simple herdsman  an humble farmer  am as nothing  what 
indeed   if product is to be compared with product   are my cheeses and
my beans in the presence of his  iliad   but  if homer wishes to take
from me all that i possess  and make me his slave in return for his
inimitable poem  i will give up the pleasure of his lays  and dismiss
him  i can do without his  iliad   and wait  if necessary  for the
 aeneid  

homer cannot live twenty four hours without my products  let him accept 
then  the little that i have to offer  and then his muse may instruct 
encourage  and console me 

 what  do you say that such should be the condition of one who sings of
gods and men  alms  with the humiliation and suffering which they bring
with them   what barbarous generosity      do not get excited  i beg
of you  property makes of a poet either a croesus or a beggar  only
equality knows how to honor and to praise him  what is its duty  to
regulate the right of the singer and the duty of the listener  now 
notice this point  which is a very important one in the solution of this
question  both are free  the one to sell  the other to buy  henceforth
their respective pretensions go for nothing  and the estimate  whether
fair or unfair  that they place  the one upon his verse  the other
upon his liberality  can have no influence upon the conditions of the
contract  we must no longer  in making our bargains  weigh talent  we
must consider products only 

in order that the bard of achilles may get his due reward  he must first
make himself wanted  that done  the exchange of his verse for a fee of
any kind  being a free act  must be at the same time a just act  that
is  the poet s fee must be equal to his product  now  what is the value
of this product 

let us suppose  in the first place  that this  iliad   this chef d 
oeuvre that is to be equitably rewarded  is really above price  that we
do not know how to appraise it  if the public  who are free to purchase
it  refuse to do so  it is clear that  the poem being unexchangeable 
its intrinsic value will not be diminished  but that its exchangeable
value  or its productive utility  will be reduced to zero  will be
nothing at all  then we must seek the amount of wages to be paid between
infinity on the one hand and nothing on the other  at an equal distance
from each  since all rights and liberties are entitled to equal respect 
in other words  it is not the intrinsic value  but the relative value 
of the thing sold that needs to be fixed  the question grows simpler 
what is this relative value  to what reward does a poem like the  iliad 
entitle its author 

the first business of political economy  after fixing its definitions 
was the solution of this problem  now  not only has it not been solved 
but it has been declared insoluble  according to the economists 
the relative or exchangeable value of things cannot be absolutely
determined  it necessarily varies 


 the value of a thing   says say   is a positive quantity  but only for
a given moment  it is its nature to perpetually vary  to change from one
point to another  nothing can fix it absolutely  because it is based
on needs and means of production which vary with every moment  these
variations complicate economical phenomena  and often render them very
difficult of observation and solution  i know no remedy for this  it is
not in our power to change the nature of things  


elsewhere say says  and repeats  that value being based on utility  and
utility depending entirely on our needs  whims  customs  &c   value
is as variable as opinion  now  political economy being the science
of values  of their production  distribution  exchange  and
consumption   if exchangeable value cannot be absolutely determined 
how is political economy possible  how can it be a science  how can two
economists look each other in the face without laughing  how dare they
insult metaphysicians and psychologists  what  that fool of a descartes
imagined that philosophy needed an immovable base  an  aliquid
inconcussum   on which the edifice of science might be built  and he was
simple enough to search for it  and the hermes of economy  trismegistus
say  devoting half a volume to the amplification of that solemn text 
 political economy is a science   has the courage to affirm immediately
afterwards that this science cannot determine its object   which is
equivalent to saying that it is without a principle or foundation  he
does not know  then  the illustrious say  the nature of a science  or
rather  he knows nothing of the subject which he discusses 

say s example has borne its fruits  political economy  as it exists at
present  resembles ontology  discussing effects and causes  it knows
nothing  explains nothing  decides nothing  the ideas honored with the
name of economic laws are nothing more than a few trifling generalities 
to which the economists thought to give an appearance of depth by
clothing them in high sounding words  as for the attempts that have been
made by the economists to solve social problems  all that can be said
of them is  that  if a glimmer of sense occasionally appears in their
lucubrations  they immediately fall back into absurdity  for twenty five
years political economy  like a heavy fog  has weighed upon france 
checking the efforts of the mind  and setting limits to liberty 

has every creation of industry a venal  absolute  unchangeable  and
consequently legitimate and true value   yes 

can every product of man be exchanged for some other product of
man   yes  again 

how many nails is a pair of shoes worth 

if we can solve this appalling problem  we shall have the key of the
social system for which humanity has been searching for six thousand
years  in the presence of this problem  the economist recoils confused 
the peasant who can neither read nor write replies without hesitation 
 as many as can be made in the same time  and with the same expense  

the absolute value of a thing  then  is its cost in time and expense 
how much is a diamond worth which costs only the labor of picking it
up   nothing  it is not a product of man  how much will it be worth when
cut and mounted   the time and expense which it has cost the laborer 
why  then  is it sold at so high a price   because men are not free 
society must regulate the exchange and distribution of the rarest
things  as it does that of the most common ones  in such a way that each
may share in the enjoyment of them  what  then  is that value which is
based upon opinion   delusion  injustice  and robbery 

by this rule  it is easy to reconcile every body  if the mean term 
which we are searching for  between an infinite value and no value at
all is expressed in the case of every product  by the amount of time and
expense which the product cost  a poem which has cost its author thirty
years of labor and an outlay of ten thousand francs in journeys  books 
&c   must be paid for by the ordinary wages received by a laborer during
thirty years  plus ten thousand francs indemnity for expense incurred 
suppose the whole amount to be fifty thousand francs  if the society
which gets the benefit of the production include a million of men  my
share of the debt is five centimes 

this gives rise to a few observations 

1  the same product  at different times and in different places  may
cost more or less of time and outlay  in this view  it is true that
value is a variable quantity  but this variation is not that of the
economists  who place in their list of the causes of the variation of
values  not only the means of production  but taste  caprice  fashion 
and opinion  in short  the true value of a thing is invariable in its
algebraic expression  although it may vary in its monetary expression 

2  the price of every product in demand should be its cost in time and
outlay  neither more nor less  every product not in demand is a loss to
the producer  a commercial non value 

3  the ignorance of the principle of evaluation  and the difficulty
under many circumstances of applying it  is the source of commercial
fraud  and one of the most potent causes of the inequality of fortunes 

4  to reward certain industries and pay for certain products  a society
is needed which corresponds in size with the rarity of talents  the
costliness of the products  and the variety of the arts and sciences 
if  for example  a society of fifty farmers can support a schoolmaster 
it requires one hundred for a shoemaker  one hundred and fifty for a
blacksmith  two hundred for a tailor  &c  if the number of farmers rises
to one thousand  ten thousand  one hundred thousand  &c   as fast as
their number increases  that of the functionaries which are earliest
required must increase in the same proportion  so that the highest
functions become possible only in the most powerful societies   17  that
is the peculiar feature of capacities  the character of genius  the seal
of its glory  cannot arise and develop itself  except in the bosom of
a great nation  but this physiological condition  necessary to the
existence of genius  adds nothing to its social rights  far from
that   the delay in its appearance proves that  in economical and
civil affairs  the loftiest intelligence must submit to the equality
of possessions  an equality which is anterior to it  and of which it
constitutes the crown 


this is severe on our pride  but it is an inexorable truth  and here
psychology comes to the aid of social economy  giving us to understand
that talent and material recompense have no common measure  that  in
this respect  the condition of all producers is equal  consequently 
that all comparison between them  and all distinction in fortunes  is
impossible 

   in fact  every work coming from the hands of man  compared with the
raw material of which it is composed  is beyond price  in this respect 
the distance is as great between a pair of wooden shoes and the trunk of
a walnut tree  as between a statue by scopas and a block of marble 
the genius of the simplest mechanic exerts as much influence over the
materials which he uses  as does the mind of a newton over the inert
spheres whose distances  volumes  and revolutions he calculates  you ask
for talent and genius a corresponding degree of honor and reward  fix
for me the value of a wood cutter s talent  and i will fix that of
homer  if any thing can reward intelligence  it is intelligence itself 
that is what happens  when various classes of producers pay to each
other a reciprocal tribute of admiration and praise  but if they
contemplate an exchange of products with a view to satisfying mutual
needs  this exchange must be effected in accordance with a system of
economy which is indifferent to considerations of talent and genius  and
whose laws are deduced  not from vague and meaningless admiration  but
from a just balance between debit and credit  in short  from commercial
accounts 

now  that no one may imagine that the liberty of buying and selling
is the sole basis of the equality of wages  and that society s sole
protection against superiority of talent lies in a certain force of
inertia which has nothing in common with right  i shall proceed to
explain why all capacities are entitled to the same reward  and why a
corresponding difference in wages would be an injustice  i shall prove
that the obligation to stoop to the social level is inherent in talent 
and on this very superiority of genius i will found the equality of
fortunes  i have just given the negative argument in favor of rewarding
all capacities alike  i will now give the direct and positive argument 

listen  first  to the economist  it is always pleasant to see how he
reasons  and how he understands justice  without him  moreover  without
his amusing blunders and his wonderful arguments  we should learn
nothing  equality  so odious to the economist  owes every thing to
political economy 


 when the parents of a physician  the text says a lawyer  which is
not so good an example  have expended on his education forty thousand
francs  this sum may be regarded as so much capital invested in his
head  it is therefore permissible to consider it as yielding an annual
income of four thousand francs  if the physician earns thirty thousand 
there remains an income of twenty six thousand francs due to the
personal talents given him by nature  this natural capital  then  if we
assume ten per cent  as the rate of interest  amounts to two hundred
and sixty thousand francs  and the capital given him by his parents  in
defraying the expenses of his education  to forty thousand francs  the
union of these two kinds of capital constitutes his fortune    say 
complete course  &c 


say divides the fortune of the physician into two parts  one is composed
of the capital which went to pay for his education  the other represents
his personal talents  this division is just  it is in conformity with
the nature of things  it is universally admitted  it serves as the
major premise of that grand argument which establishes the inequality of
capacities  i accept this premise without qualification  let us look at
the consequences 

1  say credits the physician with forty thousand francs   the cost of
his education  this amount should be entered upon the debit side of the
account  for  although this expense was incurred for him  it was not
incurred by him  then  instead of appropriating these forty thousand
francs  the physician should add them to the price of his product  and
repay them to those who are entitled to them  notice  further  that
say speaks of income instead of reimbursement  reasoning on the false
principle of the productivity of capital  the expense of educating a
talent is a debt contracted by this talent  from the very fact of its
existence  it becomes a debtor to an amount equal to the cost of its
production  this is so true and simple that  if the education of some
one child in a family has cost double or triple that of its brothers 
the latter are entitled to a proportional amount of the property
previous to its division  there is no difficulty about this in the case
of guardianship  when the estate is administered in the name of the
minors 

2  that which i have just said of the obligation incurred by talent of
repaying the cost of its education does not embarrass the economist  the
man of talent  he says  inheriting from his family  inherits among other
things a claim to the forty thousand francs which his education costs 
and he becomes  in consequence  its proprietor  but this is to abandon
the right of talent  and to fall back upon the right of occupancy  which
again calls up all the questions asked in chapter ii  what is the right
of occupancy  what is inheritance  is the right of succession a right of
accumulation or only a right of choice  how did the physician s father
get his fortune  was he a proprietor  or only a usufructuary  if he was
rich  let him account for his wealth  if he was poor  how could he incur
so large an expense  if he received aid  what right had he to use that
aid to the disadvantage of his benefactors  &c  

3   there remains an income of twenty six thousand francs due to
the personal talents given him by nature    say   as above quoted  
reasoning from this premise  say concludes that our physician s talent
is equivalent to a capital of two hundred and sixty thousand francs 
this skilful calculator mistakes a consequence for a principle  the
talent must not be measured by the gain  but rather the gain by
the talent  for it may happen  that  notwithstanding his merit  the
physician in question will gain nothing at all  in which case will it be
necessary to conclude that his talent or fortune is equivalent to zero 
to such a result  however  would say s reasoning lead  a result which is
clearly absurd 

now  it is impossible to place a money value on any talent whatsoever 
since talent and money have no common measure  on what plausible ground
can it be maintained that a physician should be paid two  three  or a
hundred times as much as a peasant  an unavoidable difficulty  which has
never been solved save by avarice  necessity  and oppression  it is not
thus that the right of talent should be determined  but how is it to be
determined 

4  i say  first  that the physician must be treated with as much favor
as any other producer  that he must not be placed below the level of
others  this i will not stop to prove  but i add that neither must he be
lifted above that level  because his talent is collective property for
which he did not pay  and for which he is ever in debt 

just as the creation of every instrument of production is the result of
collective force  so also are a man s talent and knowledge the product
of universal intelligence and of general knowledge slowly accumulated
by a number of masters  and through the aid of many inferior industries 
when the physician has paid for his teachers  his books  his diplomas 
and all the other items of his educational expenses  he has no more paid
for his talent than the capitalist pays for his house and land when he
gives his employees their wages  the man of talent has contributed to
the production in himself of a useful instrument  he has  then  a share
in its possession  he is not its proprietor  there exist side by side in
him a free laborer and an accumulated social capital  as a laborer  he
is charged with the use of an instrument  with the superintendence of a
machine  namely  his capacity  as capital  he is not his own master  he
uses himself  not for his own benefit  but for that of others 

even if talent did not find in its own excellence a reward for the
sacrifices which it costs  still would it be easier to find reasons for
lowering its reward than for raising it above the common level 
every producer receives an education  every laborer is a talent  a
capacity   that is  a piece of collective property  but all talents are
not equally costly  it takes but few teachers  but few years  and but
little study  to make a farmer or a mechanic  the generative effort
and  if i may venture to use such language  the period of social
gestation are proportional to the loftiness of the capacity  but while
the physician  the poet  the artist  and the savant produce but little 
and that slowly  the productions of the farmer are much less uncertain 
and do not require so long a time  whatever be then the capacity of a
man   when this capacity is once created   it does not belong to him 
like the material fashioned by an industrious hand  it had the power
of becoming  and society has given it being  shall the vase say to the
potter   i am that i am  and i owe you nothing  

the artist  the savant  and the poet find their just recompense in the
permission that society gives them to devote themselves exclusively to
science and to art  so that in reality they do not labor for themselves 
but for society  which creates them  and requires of them no other duty 
society can  if need be  do without prose and verse  music and painting 
and the knowledge of the movements of the moon and stars  but it cannot
live a single day without food and shelter 

undoubtedly  man does not live by bread alone  he must  also  according
to the gospel   live by the word of god  that is  he must love the
good and do it  know and admire the beautiful  and study the marvels of
nature  but in order to cultivate his mind  he must first take care of
his body   the latter duty is as necessary as the former is noble  if it
is glorious to charm and instruct men  it is honorable as well to feed
them  when  then  society  faithful to the principle of the division
of labor  intrusts a work of art or of science to one of its members 
allowing him to abandon ordinary labor  it owes him an indemnity for
all which it prevents him from producing industrially  but it owes him
nothing more  if he should demand more  society should  by refusing his
services  annihilate his pretensions  forced  then  in order to live  to
devote himself to labor repugnant to his nature  the man of genius would
feel his weakness  and would live the most distasteful of lives 

they tell of a celebrated singer who demanded of the empress of russia
 catherine ii  twenty thousand roubles for his services   that is more
than i give my field marshals   said catherine   your majesty   replied
the other   has only to make singers of her field marshals  

if france  more powerful than catherine ii  should say to mademoiselle
rachel   you must act for one hundred louis  or else spin cotton   to
m  duprez   you must sing for two thousand four hundred francs  or else
work in the vineyard    do you think that the actress rachel  and the
singer duprez  would abandon the stage  if they did  they would be the
first to repent it 

mademoiselle rachel receives  they say  sixty thousand francs annually
from the comedie francaise  for a talent like hers  it is a slight fee 
why not one hundred thousand francs  two hundred thousand francs  why 
not a civil list  what meanness  are we really guilty of chaffering with
an artist like mademoiselle rachel 

it is said  in reply  that the managers of the theatre cannot give more
without incurring a loss  that they admit the superior talent of
their young associate  but that  in fixing her salary  they have been
compelled to take the account of the company s receipts and expenses
into consideration also 

that is just  but it only confirms what i have said  namely  that an
artist s talent may be infinite  but that its mercenary claims are
necessarily limited   on the one hand  by its usefulness to the society
which rewards it  on the other  by the resources of this society  in
other words  that the demand of the seller is balanced by the right of
the buyer 

mademoiselle rachel  they say  brings to the treasury of the
theatre francais more than sixty thousand francs  i admit it  but then i
blame the theatre  from whom does the theatre francais take this
money  from some curious people who are perfectly free  yes  but the
workingmen  the lessees  the tenants  those who borrow by pawning their
possessions  from whom these curious people recover all that they pay to
the theatre   are they free  and when the better part of their products
are consumed by others at the play  do you assure me that their families
are not in want  until the french people  reflecting on the salaries
paid to all artists  savants  and public functionaries  have plainly
expressed their wish and judgment as to the matter  the salaries of
mademoiselle rachel and all her fellow artists will be a compulsory tax
extorted by violence  to reward pride  and support libertinism 

it is because we are neither free nor sufficiently enlightened  that we
submit to be cheated in our bargains  that the laborer pays the duties
levied by the prestige of power and the selfishness of talent upon the
curiosity of the idle  and that we are perpetually scandalized by these
monstrous inequalities which are encouraged and applauded by public
opinion 

the whole nation  and the nation only  pays its authors  its savants 
its artists  its officials  whatever be the hands through which their
salaries pass  on what basis should it pay them  on the basis of
equality  i have proved it by estimating the value of talent  i shall
confirm it in the following chapter  by proving the impossibility of all
social inequality 

what have we shown so far  things so simple that really they seem
silly   

that  as the traveller does not appropriate the route which he
traverses  so the farmer does not appropriate the field which he sows 

that if  nevertheless  by reason of his industry  a laborer may
appropriate the material which he employs  every employer of material
becomes  by the same title  a proprietor 

that all capital  whether material or mental  being the result of
collective labor  is  in consequence  collective property 

that the strong have no right to encroach upon the labor of the weak 
nor the shrewd to take advantage of the credulity of the simple 

finally  that no one can be forced to buy that which he does not want 
still less to pay for that which he has not bought  and  consequently 
that the exchangeable value of a product  being measured neither by the
opinion of the buyer nor that of the seller  but by the amount of time
and outlay which it has cost  the property of each always remains the
same 

are not these very simple truths  well  as simple as they seem to you 
reader  you shall yet see others which surpass them in dullness and
simplicity  for our course is the reverse of that of the geometricians 
with them  the farther they advance  the more difficult their problems
become  we  on the contrary  after having commenced with the most
abstruse propositions  shall end with the axioms 

but i must close this chapter with an exposition of one of those
startling truths which never have been dreamed of by legists or
economists 



  8   that  from the stand point of justice  labor destroys property 

this proposition is the logical result of the two preceding sections 
which we have just summed up 

the isolated man can supply but a very small portion of his wants  all
his power lies in association  and in the intelligent combination of
universal effort  the division and co operation of labor multiply the
quantity and the variety of products  the individuality of functions
improves their quality 

there is not a man  then  but lives upon the products of several
thousand different industries  not a laborer but receives from society
at large the things which he consumes  and  with these  the power to
reproduce  who  indeed  would venture the assertion   i produce  by
my own effort  all that i consume  i need the aid of no one else  
the farmer  whom the early economists regarded as the only real
producer  the farmer  housed  furnished  clothed  fed  and assisted
by the mason  the carpenter  the tailor  the miller  the baker  the
butcher  the grocer  the blacksmith  &c    the farmer  i say  can he
boast that he produces by his own unaided effort 

the various articles of consumption are given to each by all 
consequently  the production of each involves the production of all 
one product cannot exist without another  an isolated industry is an
impossible thing  what would be the harvest of the farmer  if others
did not manufacture for him barns  wagons  ploughs  clothes  &c   where
would be the savant without the publisher  the printer without the
typecaster and the machinist  and these  in their turn  without a
multitude of other industries     let us not prolong this catalogue  so
easy to extend  lest we be accused of uttering commonplaces  all
industries are united by mutual relations in a single group  all
productions do reciprocal service as means and end  all varieties of
talent are but a series of changes from the inferior to the superior 

now  this undisputed and indisputable fact of the general participation
in every species of product makes all individual productions common  so
that every product  coming from the hands of the producer  is mortgaged
in advance by society  the producer himself is entitled to only
that portion of his product  which is expressed by a fraction whose
denominator is equal to the number of individuals of which society is
composed  it is true that in return this same producer has a share in
all the products of others  so that he has a claim upon all  just as
all have a claim upon him  but is it not clear that this reciprocity of
mortgages  far from authorizing property  destroys even possession  the
laborer is not even possessor of his product  scarcely has he finished
it  when society claims it 

 but   it will be answered   even if that is so  even if the product
does not belong to the producer  still society gives each laborer an
equivalent for his product  and this equivalent  this salary  this
reward  this allowance  becomes his property  do you deny that this
property is legitimate  and if the laborer  instead of consuming his
entire wages  chooses to economize   who dare question his right to do
so  

the laborer is not even proprietor of the price of his labor  and cannot
absolutely control its disposition  let us not be blinded by a spurious
justice  that which is given the laborer in exchange for his product is
not given him as a reward for past labor  but to provide for and secure
future labor  we consume before we produce  the laborer may say at the
end of the day   i have paid yesterday s expenses  to morrow i shall pay
those of today   at every moment of his life  the member of society is
in debt  he dies with the debt unpaid   how is it possible for him to
accumulate 

they talk of economy  it is the proprietor s hobby  under a system of
equality  all economy which does not aim at subsequent reproduction or
enjoyment is impossible  why  because the thing saved  since it cannot
be converted into capital  has no object  and is without a final cause 
this will be explained more fully in the next chapter 

to conclude   

the laborer  in his relation to society  is a debtor who of necessity
dies insolvent  the proprietor is an unfaithful guardian who denies the
receipt of the deposit committed to his care  and wishes to be paid for
his guardianship down to the last day 

lest the principles just set forth may appear to certain readers
too metaphysical  i shall reproduce them in a more concrete form 
intelligible to the dullest brains  and pregnant with the most important
consequences 

hitherto  i have considered property as a power of exclusion  hereafter 
i shall examine it as a power of invasion 




chapter iv  that property is impossible 

the last resort of proprietors   the overwhelming argument whose
invincible potency reassures them   is that  in their opinion  equality
of conditions is impossible   equality of conditions is a chimera   they
cry with a knowing air   distribute wealth equally to day  to morrow
this equality will have vanished  

to this hackneyed objection  which they repeat everywhere with the most
marvellous assurance  they never fail to add the following comment  as
a sort of glory be to the father   if all men were equal  nobody would
work   this anthem is sung with variations 

 if all were masters  nobody would obey  

 if nobody were rich  who would employ the poor  

and   if nobody were poor  who would labor for the rich  

but let us have done with invective  we have better arguments at our
command 

if i show that property itself is impossible  that it is property which
is a contradiction  a chimera  a utopia  and if i show it no longer
by metaphysics and jurisprudence  but by figures  equations  and
calculations   imagine the fright of the astounded proprietor  and you 
reader  what do you think of the retort 

numbers govern the world  mundum regunt numeri  this proverb applies
as aptly to the moral and political  as to the sidereal and molecular 
world  the elements of justice are identical with those of algebra 
legislation and government are simply the arts of classifying
and balancing powers  all jurisprudence falls within the rules of
arithmetic  this chapter and the next will serve to lay the foundations
of this extraordinary doctrine  then will be unfolded to the reader s
vision an immense and novel career  then shall we commence to see in
numerical relations the synthetic unity of philosophy and the sciences 
and  filled with admiration and enthusiasm for this profound and
majestic simplicity of nature  we shall shout with the apostle   yes 
the eternal has made all things by number  weight  and measure   we
shall understand not only that equality of conditions is possible  but
that all else is impossible  that this seeming impossibility which
we charge upon it arises from the fact that we always think of it
in connection either with the proprietary or the communistic
regime   political systems equally irreconcilable with human nature  we
shall see finally that equality is constantly being realized without our
knowledge  even at the very moment when we are pronouncing it incapable
of realization  that the time draws near when  without any effort or
even wish of ours  we shall have it universally established  that with
it  in it  and by it  the natural and true political order must make
itself manifest 

it has been said  in speaking of the blindness and obstinacy of the
passions  that  if man had any thing to gain by denying the truths of
arithmetic  he would find some means of unsettling their certainty  here
is an opportunity to try this curious experiment  i attack property 
no longer with its own maxims  but with arithmetic  let the proprietors
prepare to verify my figures  for  if unfortunately for them the figures
prove accurate  the proprietors are lost 

in proving the impossibility of property  i complete the proof of its
injustice  in fact   

that which is just must be useful 

that which is useful must be true 

that which is true must be possible 

therefore  every thing which is impossible is untrue  useless  unjust 
then   a priori   we may judge of the justice of any thing by its
possibility  so that if the thing were absolutely impossible  it would
be absolutely unjust 



property is physically and mathematically impossible 

demonstration 

axiom   property is the right of increase claimed by the proprietor over
any thing which he has stamped as his own 


this proposition is purely an axiom  because   

1  it is not a definition  since it does not express all that is
included in the right of property  the right of sale  of exchange  of
gift  the right to transform  to alter  to consume  to destroy  to
use and abuse  &c  all these rights are so many different powers of
property  which we may consider separately  but which we disregard here 
that we may devote all our attention to this single one   the right of
increase 

2  it is universally admitted  no one can deny it without denying the
facts  without being instantly belied by universal custom 

3  it is self evident  since property is always accompanied  either
actually or potentially  by the fact which this axiom expresses  and
through this fact  mainly  property manifests  establishes  and asserts
itself 

4  finally  its negation involves a contradiction  the right of increase
is really an inherent right  so essential a part of property  that  in
its absence  property is null and void 

observations   increase receives different names according to the
thing by which it is yielded  if by land  farm rent  if by houses and
furniture  rent  if by life investments  revenue  if by money  interest 
if by exchange  advantage  gain  profit  three things which must not be
confounded with the wages or legitimate price of labor  

increase  a sort of royal prerogative  of tangible and consumable
homage  is due to the proprietor on account of his nominal and
metaphysical occupancy  his seal is set upon the thing  that is enough
to prevent any one else from occupying it without his permission 

this permission to use his things the proprietor may  if he chooses 
freely grant  commonly he sells it  this sale is really a stellionate
and an extortion  but by the legal fiction of the right of property 
this same sale  severely punished  we know not why  in other cases  is a
source of profit and value to the proprietor 

the amount demanded by the proprietor  in payment for this permission 
is expressed in monetary terms by the dividend which the supposed
product yields in nature  so that  by the right of increase  the
proprietor reaps and does not plough  gleans and does not till  consumes
and does not produce  enjoys and does not labor  very different from the
idols of the psalmist are the gods of property  the former had hands and
felt not  the latter  on the contrary   manus habent et palpabunt  
   the right of increase is conferred in a very mysterious and
supernatural manner  the inauguration of a proprietor is accompanied
by the awful ceremonies of an ancient initiation  first  comes the
consecration of the article  a consecration which makes known to all
that they must offer up a suitable sacrifice to the proprietor  whenever
they wish  by his permission obtained and signed  to use his article 

second  comes the anathema  which prohibits  except on the conditions
aforesaid  all persons from touching the article  even in the
proprietor s absence  and pronounces every violator of property
sacrilegious  infamous  amenable to the secular power  and deserving of
being handed over to it 

finally  the dedication  which enables the proprietor or patron
saint  the god chosen to watch over the article  to inhabit it mentally 
like a divinity in his sanctuary  by means of this dedication  the
substance of the article  so to speak  becomes converted into the person
of the proprietor  who is regarded as ever present in its form 

this is exactly the doctrine of the writers on jurisprudence 
 property   says toullier   is a moral quality inherent in a thing 
an actual bond which fastens it to the proprietor  and which cannot be
broken save by his act   locke humbly doubted whether god could make
matter intelligent  toullier asserts that the proprietor renders it
moral  how much does he lack of being a god  these are by no means
exaggerations 

property is the right of increase  that is  the power to produce without
labor  now  to produce without labor is to make something from nothing 
in short  to create  surely it is no more difficult to do this than to
moralize matter  the jurists are right  then  in applying to proprietors
this passage from the scriptures    ego dixi  dii estis et filii excelsi
omnes     i have said  ye are gods  and all of you are children of the
most high  

property is the right of increase  to us this axiom shall be like the
name of the beast in the apocalypse   a name in which is hidden the
complete explanation of the whole mystery of this beast  it was known
that he who should solve the mystery of this name would obtain a
knowledge of the whole prophecy  and would succeed in mastering the
beast  well  by the most careful interpretation of our axiom we shall
kill the sphinx of property 

starting from this eminently characteristic fact  the right of
increase  we shall pursue the old serpent through his coils  we shall
count the murderous entwinings of this frightful taenia  whose head 
with its thousand suckers  is always hidden from the sword of its most
violent enemies  though abandoning to them immense fragments of its
body  it requires something more than courage to subdue this monster 
it was written that it should not die until a proletaire  armed with a
magic wand  had fought with it 

corollaries   1  the amount of increase is proportional to the thing
increased  whatever be the rate of interest   whether it rise to three 
five  or ten per cent   or fall to one half  one fourth  one tenth   it
does not matter  the law of increase remains the same  the law is as
follows   

all capital  the cash value of which can be estimated  may be considered
as a term in an arithmetical series which progresses in the ratio of one
hundred  and the revenue yielded by this capital as the corresponding
term of another arithmetical series which progresses in a ratio equal to
the rate of interest  thus  a capital of five hundred francs being the
fifth term of the arithmetical progression whose ratio is one hundred 
its revenue at three per cent  will be indicated by the fifth term of
the arithmetical progression whose ratio is three   

          100    200    300    400    500

an acquaintance with this sort of logarithms  tables of which 
calculated to a very high degree  are possessed by proprietors  will
give us the key to the most puzzling problems  and cause us to
experience a series of surprises 

by this logarithmic theory of the right of increase  a piece of
property  together with its income  may be defined as a number whose
logarithm is equal to the sum of its units divided by one hundred  and
multiplied by the rate of interest  for instance  a house valued at one
hundred thousand francs  and leased at five per cent   yields a revenue
of five thousand francs  according to the formula 100 000 x 5 / 100 =
five thousand  vice versa  a piece of land which yields  at two and a
half per cent   a revenue of three thousand francs is worth one hundred
and twenty thousand francs  according to this other formula 
3 000 x 100/ 2 1/2 = one hundred and twenty thousand 

in the first case  the ratio of the progression which marks the increase
of interest is five  in the second  it is two and a half 

observation   the forms of increase known as farm rent  income  and
interest are paid annually  rent is paid by the week  the month  or
the year  profits and gains are paid at the time of exchange  thus  the
amount of increase is proportional both to the thing increased  and
the time during which it increases  in other words  usury grows like a
cancer   foenus serpit sicut cancer  

2  the increase paid to the proprietor by the occupant is a dead loss
to the latter  for if the proprietor owed  in exchange for the increase
which he receives  some thing more than the permission which he grants 
his right of property would not be perfect  he would not possess
 jure optimo  jure perfecto   that is  he would not be in reality a
proprietor  then  all which passes from the hands of the occupant into
those of the proprietor in the name of increase  and as the price of
the permission to occupy  is a permanent gain for the latter  and a dead
loss and annihilation for the former  to whom none of it will return 
save in the forms of gift  alms  wages paid for his services  or
the price of merchandise which he has delivered  in a word  increase
perishes so far as the borrower is concerned  or to use the more
energetic latin phrase    res perit solventi  

3  the right of increase oppresses the proprietor as well as the
stranger  the master of a thing  as its proprietor  levies a tax for the
use of his property upon himself as its possessor  equal to that which
he would receive from a third party  so that capital bears interest in
the hands of the capitalist  as well as in those of the borrower and the
commandite  if  indeed  rather than accept a rent of five hundred francs
for my apartment  i prefer to occupy and enjoy it  it is clear that i
shall become my own debtor for a rent equal to that which i deny myself 
this principle is universally practised in business  and is regarded as
an axiom by the economists  manufacturers  also  who have the advantage
of being proprietors of their floating capital  although they owe no
interest to any one  in calculating their profits subtract from them 
not only their running expenses and the wages of their employees  but
also the interest on their capital  for the same reason  money lenders
retain in their own possession as little money as possible  for  since
all capital necessarily bears interest  if this interest is supplied by
no one  it comes out of the capital  which is to that extent diminished 
thus  by the right of increase  capital eats itself up  this is 
doubtless  the idea that papinius intended to convey in the phrase  as
elegant as it is forcible   foenus mordet solidam   i beg pardon for
using latin so frequently in discussing this subject  it is an homage
which i pay to the most usurious nation that ever existed 



first proposition 

property is impossible  because it demands something for nothing 


the discussion of this proposition covers the same ground as that of the
origin of farm rent  which is so much debated by the economists  when
i read the writings of the greater part of these men  i cannot avoid
a feeling of contempt mingled with anger  in view of this mass of
nonsense  in which the detestable vies with the absurd  it would be a
repetition of the story of the elephant in the moon  were it not for the
atrocity of the consequences  to seek a rational and legitimate origin
of that which is  and ever must be  only robbery  extortion  and
plunder  that must be the height of the proprietor s folly  the last
degree of bedevilment into which minds  otherwise judicious  can be
thrown by the perversity of selfishness 


 a farmer   says say   is a wheat manufacturer who  among other tools
which serve him in modifying the material from which he makes the
wheat  employs one large tool  which we call a field  if he is not the
proprietor of the field  if he is only a tenant  he pays the proprietor
for the productive service of this tool  the tenant is reimbursed by
the purchaser  the latter by another  until the product reaches the
consumer  who redeems the first payment  plus all the others  by means
of which the product has at last come into his hands  


let us lay aside the subsequent payments by which the product reaches
the consumer  and  for the present  pay attention only to the first one
of all   the rent paid to the proprietor by the tenant  on what ground 
we ask  is the proprietor entitled to this rent 

according to ricardo  macculloch  and mill  farm rent  properly
speaking  is simply the excess of the product of the most fertile land
over that of lands of an inferior quality  so that farm rent is not
demanded for the former until the increase of population renders
necessary the cultivation of the latter 

it is difficult to see any sense in this  how can a right to the land be
based upon a difference in the quality of the land  how can varieties of
soil engender a principle of legislation and politics  this reasoning
is either so subtle  or so stupid  that the more i think of it  the more
bewildered i become  suppose two pieces of land of equal area  the one 
a  capable of supporting ten thousand inhabitants  the other  b  capable
of supporting nine thousand only  when  owing to an increase in their
number  the inhabitants of a shall be forced to cultivate b  the landed
proprietors of a will exact from their tenants in a a rent proportional
to the difference between ten and nine  so say  i think  ricardo 
macculloch  and mill  but if a supports as many inhabitants as it can
contain   that is  if the inhabitants of a  by our hypothesis  have only
just enough land to keep them alive   how can they pay farm rent 

if they had gone no farther than to say that the difference in land has
occasioned farm rent  instead of caused it  this observation would have
taught us a valuable lesson  namely  that farm rent grew out of a desire
for equality  indeed  if all men have an equal right to the possession
of good land  no one can be forced to cultivate bad land without
indemnification  farm rent  according to ricardo  macculloch  and
mill  would then have been a compensation for loss and hardship  this
system of practical equality is a bad one  no doubt  but it sprang from
good intentions  what argument can ricardo  macculloch  and mill develop
therefrom in favor of property  their theory turns against themselves 
and strangles them 

malthus thinks that farm rent has its source in the power possessed by
land of producing more than is necessary to supply the wants of the
men who cultivate it  i would ask malthus why successful labor should
entitle the idle to a portion of the products 

but the worthy malthus is mistaken in regard to the fact  yes  land has
the power of producing more than is needed by those who cultivate it  if
by cultivators is meant tenants only  the tailor also makes more clothes
than he wears  and the cabinet maker more furniture than he uses  but 
since the various professions imply and sustain one another  not only
the farmer  but the followers of all arts and trades  even to the doctor
and the school teacher  are  and ought to be  regarded as cultivators of
the land  malthus bases farm rent upon the principle of commerce 
now  the fundamental law of commerce being equivalence of the products
exchanged  any thing which destroys this equivalence violates the law 
there is an error in the estimate which needs to be corrected 

buchanan  a commentator on smith  regarded farm rent as the result of a
monopoly  and maintained that labor alone is productive  consequently 
he thought that  without this monopoly  products would rise in price 
and he found no basis for farm rent save in the civil law  this opinion
is a corollary of that which makes the civil law the basis of property 
but why has the civil law  which ought to be the written expression of
justice  authorized this monopoly  whoever says monopoly  necessarily
excludes justice  now  to say that farm rent is a monopoly sanctioned by
the law  is to say that injustice is based on justice   a contradiction
in terms 

say answers buchanan  that the proprietor is not a monopolist  because a
monopolist  is one who does not increase the utility of the merchandise
which passes through his hands  

how much does the proprietor increase the utility of his tenant s
products  has he ploughed  sowed  reaped  mowed  winnowed  weeded  these
are the processes by which the tenant and his employees increase
the utility of the material which they consume for the purpose of
reproduction 


 the landed proprietor increases the utility of products by means of his
implement  the land  this implement receives in one state  and returns
in another the materials of which wheat is composed  the action of
the land is a chemical process  which so modifies the material that it
multiplies it by destroying it  the soil is then a producer of utility 
and when it  the soil   asks its pay in the form of profit  or farm
rent  for its proprietor  it at the same time gives something to the
consumer in exchange for the amount which the consumer pays it  it gives
him a produced utility  and it is the production of this utility which
warrants us in calling land productive  as well as labor  


let us clear up this matter 

the blacksmith who manufactures for the farmer implements of husbandry 
the wheelwright who makes him a cart  the mason who builds his barn 
the carpenter  the basket maker  &c    all of whom contribute to
agricultural production by the tools which they provide   are producers
of utility  consequently  they are entitled to a part of the products 


 undoubtedly   says say   but the land also is an implement whose
service must be paid for  then     


i admit that the land is an implement  but who made it  did the
proprietor  did he  by the efficacious virtue of the right of property 
by this moral quality infused into the soil  endow it with vigor and
fertility  exactly there lies the monopoly of the proprietor  in the
fact that  though he did not make the implement  he asks pay for its
use  when the creator shall present himself and claim farm rent  we will
consider the matter with him  or even when the proprietor  his pretended
representative  shall exhibit his power of attorney 


 the proprietor s service   adds say   is easy  i admit  


it is a frank confession 


 but we cannot disregard it  without property  one farmer would contend
with another for the possession of a field without a proprietor  and the
field would remain uncultivated     


then the proprietor s business is to reconcile farmers by robbing
them  o logic  o justice  o the marvellous wisdom of economists  the
proprietor  if they are right  is like perrin dandin who  when summoned
by two travellers to settle a dispute about an oyster  opened it 
gobbled it  and said to them   


 the court awards you each a shell  


could any thing worse be said of property 

will say tell us why the same farmers  who  if there were no
proprietors  would contend with each other for possession of the
soil  do not contend to day with the proprietors for this possession 
obviously  because they think them legitimate possessors  and because
their respect for even an imaginary right exceeds their avarice  i
proved  in chapter ii   that possession is sufficient  without property 
to maintain social order  would it be more difficult  then  to reconcile
possessors without masters than tenants controlled by proprietors  would
laboring men  who respect  much to their own detriment  the pretended
rights of the idler  violate the natural rights of the producer and the
manufacturer  what  if the husbandman forfeited his right to the land as
soon as he ceased to occupy it  would he become more covetous  and would
the impossibility of demanding increase  of taxing another s labor  be a
source of quarrels and law suits  the economists use singular logic 
but we are not yet through  admit that the proprietor is the legitimate
master of the land 

 the land is an instrument of production   they say  that is true  but
when  changing the noun into an adjective  they alter the phrase  thus 
 the land is a productive instrument   they make a wicked blunder 

according to quesnay and the early economists  all production comes from
the land  smith  ricardo  and de tracy  on the contrary  say that labor
is the sole agent of production  say  and most of his successors 
teach that both land and labor and capital are productive  the latter
constitute the eclectic school of political economy  the truth is  that
neither land nor labor nor capital is productive  production results
from the co operation of these three equally necessary elements  which 
taken separately  are equally sterile 

political economy  indeed  treats of the production  distribution 
and consumption of wealth or values  but of what values  of the values
produced by human industry  that is  of the changes made in matter
by man  that he may appropriate it to his own use  and not at all of
nature s spontaneous productions  man s labor consists in a simple
laying on of hands  when he has taken that trouble  he has produced a
value  until then  the salt of the sea  the water of the springs  the
grass of the fields  and the trees of the forests are to him as if they
were not  the sea  without the fisherman and his line  supplies no fish 
the forest  without the wood cutter and his axe  furnishes neither
fuel nor timber  the meadow  without the mower  yields neither hay
nor aftermath  nature is a vast mass of material to be cultivated and
converted into products  but nature produces nothing for herself  in the
economical sense  her products  in their relation to man  are not yet
products 

capital  tools  and machinery are likewise unproductive  the hammer and
the anvil  without the blacksmith and the iron  do not forge  the mill 
without the miller and the grain  does not grind  &c  bring tools and
raw material together  place a plough and some seed on fertile soil 
enter a smithy  light the fire  and shut up the shop   you will produce
nothing  the following remark was made by an economist who possessed
more good sense than most of his fellows   say credits capital with an
active part unwarranted by its nature  left to itself  it is an idle
tool    j  droz  political economy  

finally  labor and capital together  when unfortunately combined 
produce nothing  plough a sandy desert  beat the water of the rivers 
pass type through a sieve   you will get neither wheat  nor fish  nor
books  your trouble will be as fruitless as was the immense labor of the
army of xerxes  who  as herodotus says  with his three million soldiers 
scourged the hellespont for twenty four hours  as a punishment for
having broken and scattered the pontoon bridge which the great king had
thrown across it 

tools and capital  land and labor  considered individually and
abstractly  are not  literally speaking  productive  the proprietor who
asks to be rewarded for the use of a tool  or the productive power
of his land  takes for granted  then  that which is radically false 
namely  that capital produces by its own effort   and  in taking pay for
this imaginary product  he literally receives something for nothing 

objection   but if the blacksmith  the wheelwright  all manufacturers in
short  have a right to the products in return for the implements which
they furnish  and if land is an implement of production   why does not
this implement entitle its proprietor  be his claim real or imaginary 
to a portion of the products  as in the case of the manufacturers of
ploughs and wagons 

reply   here we touch the heart of the question  the mystery of
property  which we must clear up  if we would understand any thing of
the strange effects of the right of increase 

he who manufactures or repairs the farmer s tools receives the price
once  either at the time of delivery  or in several payments  and when
this price is once paid to the manufacturer  the tools which he has
delivered belong to him no more  never does he claim double payment for
the same tool  or the same job of repairs  if he annually shares in the
products of the farmer  it is owing to the fact that he annually makes
something for the farmer 

the proprietor  on the contrary  does not yield his implement  eternally
he is paid for it  eternally he keeps it 

in fact  the rent received by the proprietor is not intended to defray
the expense of maintaining and repairing the implement  this expense is
charged to the borrower  and does not concern the proprietor except as
he is interested in the preservation of the article  if he takes it upon
himself to attend to the repairs  he takes care that the money which he
expends for this purpose is repaid 

this rent does not represent the product of the implement  since of
itself the implement produces nothing  we have just proved this  and we
shall prove it more clearly still by its consequences 

finally  this rent does not represent the participation of the
proprietor in the production  since this participation could consist 
like that of the blacksmith and the wheelwright  only in the surrender
of the whole or a part of his implement  in which case he would cease
to be its proprietor  which would involve a contradiction of the idea of
property 

then  between the proprietor and his tenant there is no exchange either
of values or services  then  as our axiom says  farm rent is real
increase   an extortion based solely upon fraud and violence on the
one hand  and weakness and ignorance upon the other  products say
the economists  are bought only by products  this maxim is property s
condemnation  the proprietor  producing neither by his own labor nor by
his implement  and receiving products in exchange for nothing  is either
a parasite or a thief  then  if property can exist only as a right 
property is impossible 

corollaries   1  the republican constitution of 1793  which defined
property as  the right to enjoy the fruit of one s labor   was grossly
mistaken  it should have said   property is the right to enjoy and
dispose at will of another s goods   the fruit of another s industry and
labor  

2  every possessor of lands  houses  furniture  machinery  tools  money 
&c   who lends a thing for a price exceeding the cost of repairs  the
repairs being charged to the lender  and representing products which he
exchanges for other products   is guilty of swindling and extortion  in
short  all rent received  nominally as damages  but really as payment
for a loan  is an act of property   a robbery 

historical comment   the tax which a victorious nation levies upon a
conquered nation is genuine farm rent  the seigniorial rights abolished
by the revolution of 1789   tithes  mortmain  statute labor  &c    were
different forms of the rights of property  and they who under the titles
of nobles  seigneurs  prebendaries  &c  enjoyed these rights  were
neither more nor less than proprietors  to defend property to day is to
condemn the revolution 



second proposition 

property is impossible because wherever it exists production costs more
than it is worth 


the preceding proposition was legislative in its nature  this one
is economical  it serves to prove that property  which originates in
violence  results in waste 


 production   says say   is exchange on a large scale  to render the
exchange productive the value of the whole amount of service must be
balanced by the value of the product  if this condition is not
complied with  the exchange is unequal  the producer gives more than he
receives  


now  value being necessarily based upon utility  it follows that every
useless product is necessarily valueless   that it cannot be exchanged 
and  consequently  that it cannot be given in payment for productive
services 

then  though production may equal consumption  it never can exceed it 
for there is no real production save where there is a production of
utility  and there is no utility save where there is a possibility of
consumption  thus  so much of every product as is rendered by
excessive abundance inconsumable  becomes useless  valueless 
unexchangeable   consequently  unfit to be given in payment for any
thing whatever  and is no longer a product 

consumption  on the other hand  to be legitimate   to be true
consumption   must be reproductive of utility  for  if it is
unproductive  the products which it destroys are cancelled
values  things produced at a pure loss  a state of things which causes
products to depreciate in value  man has the power to destroy  but he
consumes only that which he reproduces  under a right system of economy 
there is then an equation between production and consumption 

these points established  let us suppose a community of one thousand
families  enclosed in a territory of a given circumference  and deprived
of foreign intercourse  let this community represent the human race 
which  scattered over the face of the earth  is really isolated  in
fact  the difference between a community and the human race being only
a numerical one  the economical results will be absolutely the same in
each case 

suppose  then  that these thousand families  devoting themselves
exclusively to wheat culture  are obliged to pay to one hundred
individuals  chosen from the mass  an annual revenue of ten per cent  on
their product  it is clear that  in such a case  the right of increase
is equivalent to a tax levied in advance upon social production  of what
use is this tax 

it cannot be levied to supply the community with provisions  for between
that and farm rent there is nothing in common  nor to pay for services
and products   for the proprietors  laboring like the others  have
labored only for themselves  finally  this tax is of no use to its
recipients who  having harvested wheat enough for their own consumption 
and not being able in a society without commerce and manufactures to
procure any thing else in exchange for it  thereby lose the advantage of
their income 

in such a society  one tenth of the product being inconsumable 
one tenth of the labor goes unpaid  production costs more than it is
worth 

now  change three hundred of our wheat producers into artisans of all
kinds  one hundred gardeners and wine growers  sixty shoemakers
and tailors  fifty carpenters and blacksmiths  eighty of various
professions  and  that nothing may be lacking  seven school masters 
one mayor  one judge  and one priest  each industry furnishes the whole
community with its special product  now  the total production being one
thousand  each laborer s consumption is one  namely  wheat  meat 
and grain  0 7  wine and vegetables  0 1  shoes and clothing  0 06 
iron work and furniture  0 05  sundries  0 08  instruction  0 007 
administration  0 002  mass  0 001  total 1 

but the community owes a revenue of ten per cent   and it matters little
whether the farmers alone pay it  or all the laborers are responsible
for it   the result is the same  the farmer raises the price of his
products in proportion to his share of the debt  the other laborers
follow his example  then  after some fluctuations  equilibrium is
established  and all pay nearly the same amount of the revenue  it
would be a grave error to assume that in a nation none but farmers pay
farm rent  the whole nation pays it 

i say  then  that by this tax of ten per cent  each laborer s
consumption is reduced as follows  wheat  0 63  wine and vegetables 
0 09  clothing and shoes  0 054  furniture and iron work  0 045  other
products  0 072  schooling  0 0063  administration  0 0018  mass 
0 0009  total 0 9 

the laborer has produced 1  he consumes only 0 9  he loses  then 
one tenth of the price of his labor  his production still costs
more than it is worth  on the other hand  the tenth received by the
proprietors is no less a waste  for  being laborers themselves  they 
like the others  possess in the nine tenths of their product the
wherewithal to live  they want for nothing  why should they wish their
proportion of bread  wine  meat  clothes  shelter  &c   to be doubled 
if they can neither consume nor exchange them  then farm rent  with
them as with the rest of the laborers  is a waste  and perishes in their
hands  extend the hypothesis  increase the number and variety of the
products  you still have the same result 

hitherto  we have considered the proprietor as taking part in the
production  not only  as say says  by the use of his instrument  but in
an effective manner and by the labor of his hands  now  it is easy to
see that  under such circumstances  property will never exist  what
happens 

the proprietor  an essentially libidinous animal  without virtue or
shame  is not satisfied with an orderly and disciplined life  he loves
property  because it enables him to do at leisure what he pleases and
when he pleases  having obtained the means of life  he gives himself up
to trivialities and indolence  he enjoys  he fritters away his time  he
goes in quest of curiosities and novel sensations  property  to enjoy
itself  has to abandon ordinary life  and busy itself in luxurious
occupations and unclean enjoyments 

instead of giving up a farm rent  which is perishing in their hands 
and thus lightening the labor of the community  our hundred proprietors
prefer to rest  in consequence of this withdrawal   the absolute
production being diminished by one hundred  while the consumption
remains the same   production and consumption seem to balance  but 
in the first place  since the proprietors no longer labor  their
consumption is  according to economical principles  unproductive 
consequently  the previous condition of the community  when the labor of
one hundred was rewarded by no products  is superseded by one in which
the products of one hundred are consumed without labor  the deficit
is always the same  whichever the column of the account in which it is
expressed  either the maxims of political economy are false  or else
property  which contradicts them  is impossible 

the economists  regarding all unproductive consumption as an evil  as
a robbery of the human race  never fail to exhort proprietors to
moderation  labor  and economy  they preach to them the necessity of
making themselves useful  of remunerating production for that which they
receive from it  they launch the most terrible curses against luxury and
laziness  very beautiful morality  surely  it is a pity that it lacks
common sense  the proprietor who labors  or  as the economists say 
who makes himself useful  is paid for this labor and utility  is he 
therefore  any the less idle as concerns the property which he does not
use  and from which he receives an income  his condition  whatever he
may do  is an unproductive and felonious one  he cannot cease to waste
and destroy without ceasing to be a proprietor 

but this is only the least of the evils which property engenders 

society has to maintain some idle people  whether or no  it will always
have the blind  the maimed  the insane  and the idiotic  it can easily
support a few sluggards  at this point  the impossibilities thicken and
become complicated 



third proposition 

property is impossible  because  with a given capital  production is
proportional to labor  not to property 


to pay a farm rent of one hundred at the rate of ten per cent  of the
product  the product must be one thousand  that the product may be one
thousand  a force of one thousand laborers is needed  it follows 
that in granting a furlough  as we have just done  to our one hundred
laborer proprietors  all of whom had an equal right to lead the life
of men of income   we have placed ourselves in a position where we are
unable to pay their revenues  in fact  the productive power  which at
first was one thousand  being now but nine hundred  the production is
also reduced to nine hundred  one tenth of which is ninety  either 
then  ten proprietors out of the one hundred cannot be paid   provided
the remaining ninety are to get the whole amount of their farm rent   or
else all must consent to a decrease of ten per cent  for it is not for
the laborer  who has been wanting in no particular  who has produced as
in the past  to suffer by the withdrawal of the proprietor  the
latter must take the consequences of his own idleness  but  then  the
proprietor becomes poorer for the very reason that he wishes to enjoy 
by exercising his right  he loses it  so that property seems to decrease
and vanish in proportion as we try to lay hold of it   the more we
pursue it  the more it eludes our grasp  what sort of a right is that
which is governed by numerical relations  and which an arithmetical
calculation can destroy 

the laborer proprietor received  first  as laborer  0 9 in wages 
second  as proprietor  1 in farm rent  he said to himself   my farm rent
is sufficient  i have enough and to spare without my labor   and thus
it is that the income upon which he calculated gets diminished by
one tenth   he at the same time not even suspecting the cause of this
diminution  by taking part in the production  he was himself the creator
of this tenth which has vanished  and while he thought to labor only for
himself  he unwittingly suffered a loss in exchanging his products  by
which he was made to pay to himself one tenth of his own farm rent  like
every one else  he produced 1  and received but 0 9

if  instead of nine hundred laborers  there had been but five hundred 
the whole amount of farm rent would have been reduced to fifty  if there
had been but one hundred  it would have fallen to ten  we may posit 
then  the following axiom as a law of proprietary economy  increase must
diminish as the number of idlers augments 

   this first result will lead us to another more surprising still 
its effect is to deliver us at one blow from all the evils of property 
without abolishing it  without wronging proprietors  and by a highly
conservative process 

we have just proved that  if the farm rent in a community of one
thousand laborers is one hundred  that of nine hundred would be ninety 
that of eight hundred  eighty  that of one hundred  ten  &c  so that  in
a community where there was but one laborer  the farm rent would be but
0 1  no matter how great the extent and value of the land appropriated 
therefore  with a given landed capital  production is proportional to
labor  not to property 

guided by this principle  let us try to ascertain the maximum increase
of all property whatever 

what is  essentially  a farm lease  it is a contract by which the
proprietor yields to a tenant possession of his land  in consideration
of a portion of that which it yields him  the proprietor  if  in
consequence of an increase in his household  the tenant becomes ten
times as strong as the proprietor  he will produce ten times as
much  would the proprietor in such a case be justified in raising the
farm rent tenfold  his right is not  the more you produce  the more i
demand  it is  the more i sacrifice  the more i demand  the increase
in the tenant s household  the number of hands at his disposal  the
resources of his industry   all these serve to increase production  but
bear no relation to the proprietor  his claims are to be measured by his
own productive capacity  not that of others  property is the right of
increase  not a poll tax  how could a man  hardly capable of cultivating
even a few acres by himself  demand of a community  on the ground of its
use of ten thousand acres of his property  ten thousand times as much
as he is incapable of producing from one acre  why should the price of a
loan be governed by the skill and strength of the borrower  rather than
by the utility sacrificed by the proprietor  we must recognize  then 
this second economical law  increase is measured by a fraction of the
proprietors production 

now  this production  what is it  in other words  what can the lord and
master of a piece of land justly claim to have sacrificed in lending it
to a tenant 

the productive capacity of a proprietor  like that of any laborer  being
one  the product which he sacrifices in surrendering his land is also
one  if  then  the rate of increase is ten per cent   the maximum
increase is 0 1 

but we have seen that  whenever a proprietor withdraws from production 
the amount of products is lessened by 1  then the increase which accrues
to him  being equal to 0 1 while he remains among the laborers  will be
equal after his withdrawal  by the law of the decrease of farm rent 
to 0 09  thus we are led to this final formula  the maximum income of
a proprietor is equal to the square root of the product of one laborer
 some number being agreed upon to express this product   the diminution
which this income suffers  if the proprietor is idle  is equal to a
fraction whose numerator is 1  and whose denominator is the number which
expresses the product 

thus the maximum income of an idle proprietor  or of one who labors in
his own behalf outside of the community  figured at ten per cent  on an
average production of one thousand francs per laborer  would be ninety
francs  if  then  there are in france one million proprietors with an
income of one thousand francs each  which they consume unproductively 
instead of the one thousand millions which are paid them annually  they
are entitled in strict justice  and by the most accurate calculation  to
ninety millions only 

it is something of a reduction  to take nine hundred and ten millions
from the burdens which weigh so heavily upon the laboring class 
nevertheless  the account is not finished  and the laborer is still
ignorant of the full extent of his rights 

what is the right of increase when confined within just limits  a
recognition of the right of occupancy  but since all have an equal right
of occupancy  every man is by the same title a proprietor  every man has
a right to an income equal to a fraction of his product  if  then 
the laborer is obliged by the right of property to pay a rent to the
proprietor  the proprietor is obliged by the same right to pay the same
amount of rent to the laborer  and  since their rights balance each
other  the difference between them is zero 

 scholium    if farm rent is only a fraction of the supposed product of
the proprietor  whatever the amount and value of the property  the same
is true in the case of a large number of small and distinct proprietors 
for  although one man may use the property of each separately  he cannot
use the property of all at the same time 

to sum up  the right of increase  which can exist only within very
narrow limits  defined by the laws of production  is annihilated by
the right of occupancy  now  without the right of increase  there is no
property  then property is impossible 



fourth proposition 

property is impossible  because it is homicide 


if the right of increase could be subjected to the laws of reason and
justice  it would be reduced to an indemnity or reward whose maximum
never could exceed  for a single laborer  a certain fraction of that
which he is capable of producing  this we have just shown  but why
should the right of increase  let us not fear to call it by its right
name  the right of robbery  be governed by reason  with which it has
nothing in common  the proprietor is not content with the increase
allotted him by good sense and the nature of things  he demands ten
times  a hundred times  a thousand times  a million times as much  by
his own labor  his property would yield him a product equal only to
one  and he demands of society  no longer a right proportional to his
productive capacity  but a per capita tax  he taxes his fellows in
proportion to their strength  their number  and their industry  a son
is born to a farmer   good   says the proprietor   one more chance
for increase   by what process has farm rent been thus changed into
a poll tax  why have our jurists and our theologians failed  with all
their shrewdness  to check the extension of the right of increase 

the proprietor  having estimated from his own productive capacity the
number of laborers which his property will accommodate  divides it
into as many portions  and says   each one shall yield me revenue  
to increase his income  he has only to divide his property  instead
of reckoning the interest due him on his labor  he reckons it on his
capital  and  by this substitution  the same property  which in the
hands of its owner is capable of yielding only one  is worth to him
ten  a hundred  a thousand  a million  consequently  he has only to hold
himself in readiness to register the names of the laborers who apply to
him  his task consists in drafting leases and receipts 

not satisfied with the lightness of his duties  the proprietor does not
intend to bear even the deficit resulting from his idleness  he throws
it upon the shoulders of the producer  of whom he always demands the
same reward  when the farm rent of a piece of land is once raised to its
highest point  the proprietor never lowers it  high prices  the scarcity
of labor  the disadvantages of the season  even pestilence itself  have
no effect upon him  why should he suffer from hard times when he does
not labor 

here commences a new series of phenomena 

say  who reasons with marvellous clearness whenever he assails taxation 
but who is blind to the fact that the proprietor  as well as the
tax gatherer  steals from the tenant  and in the same manner  says in
his second letter to malthus   


 if the collector of taxes and those who employ him consume one sixth
of the products  they thereby compel the producers to feed  clothe  and
support themselves on five sixths of what they produce  they admit this 
but say at the same time that it is possible for each one to live on
five sixths of what he produces 

 i admit that  if they insist upon it  but i ask if they believe that the
producer would live as well  in case they demanded of him  instead of
one sixth  two sixths  or one third  of their products  no  but he would
still live  then i ask whether he would still live  in case they should
rob him of two thirds     then three quarters  but i hear no reply  


if the master of the french economists had been less blinded by his
proprietary prejudices  he would have seen that farm rent has precisely
the same effect 

take a family of peasants composed of six persons   father  mother  and
four children   living in the country  and cultivating a small piece of
ground  let us suppose that by hard labor they manage  as the saying is 
to make both ends meet  that  having lodged  warmed  clothed  and fed
themselves  they are clear of debt  but have laid up nothing  taking the
years together  they contrive to live  if the year is prosperous  the
father drinks a little more wine  the daughters buy themselves a dress 
the sons a hat  they eat a little cheese  and  occasionally  some meat 
i say that these people are on the road to wreck and ruin 

for  by the third corollary of our axiom  they owe to themselves the
interest on their own capital  estimating this capital at only eight
thousand francs at two and a half per cent   there is an annual interest
of two hundred francs to be paid  if  then  these two hundred francs 
instead of being subtracted from the gross product to be saved and
capitalized  are consumed  there is an annual deficit of two hundred
francs in the family assets  so that at the end of forty years these
good people  without suspecting it  will have eaten up their property
and become bankrupt 

this result seems ridiculous  it is a sad reality 

the conscription comes  what is the conscription  an act of property
exercised over families by the government without warning  a robbery
of men and money  the peasants do not like to part with their sons   in
that i do not think them wrong  it is hard for a young man of twenty
to gain any thing by life in the barracks  unless he is depraved  he
detests it  you can generally judge of a soldier s morality by his
hatred of his uniform  unfortunate wretches or worthless scamps   such
is the make up of the french army  this ought not to be the case   but
so it is  question a hundred thousand men  and not one will contradict
my assertion 

our peasant  in redeeming his two conscripted sons  expends four
thousand francs  which he borrows for that purpose  the interest on
this  at five per cent   is two hundred francs   a sum equal to that
referred to above  if  up to this time  the production of the family 
constantly balanced by its consumption  has been one thousand two
hundred francs  or two hundred francs per persons  in order to pay this
interest  either the six laborers must produce as much as seven  or must
consume as little as five 

curtail consumption they cannot  how can they curtail necessity  to
produce more is impossible  they can work neither harder nor longer 
shall they take a middle course  and consume five and a half while
producing six and a half  they would soon find that with the stomach
there is no compromise  that beyond a certain degree of abstinence it
is impossible to go  that strict necessity can be curtailed but little
without injury to the health  and  as for increasing the product   there
comes a storm  a drought  an epizootic  and all the hopes of the farmer
are dashed  in short  the rent will not be paid  the interest will
accumulate  the farm will be seized  and the possessor ejected 

thus a family  which lived in prosperity while it abstained from
exercising the right of property  falls into misery as soon as the
exercise of this right becomes a necessity  property requires of the
husbandman the double power of enlarging his land  and fertilizing it by
a simple command  while a man is simply possessor of the land  he finds
in it means of subsistence  as soon as he pretends to proprietorship 
it suffices him no longer  being able to produce only that which
he consumes  the fruit of his labor is his recompense for his
trouble  nothing is left for the instrument 

required to pay what he cannot produce   such is the condition of the
tenant after the proprietor has retired from social production in order
to speculate upon the labor of others by new methods 

let us now return to our first hypothesis 

the nine hundred laborers  sure that their future production will equal
that of the past  are quite surprised  after paying their farm rent  to
find themselves poorer by one tenth than they were the previous year 
in fact  this tenth  which was formerly produced and paid by the
proprietor laborer who then took part in the production  and paid part
of the  public expenses  now has not been produced  and has been paid 
it must then have been taken from the producer s consumption  to
choke this inexplicable deficit  the laborer borrows  confident of
his intention and ability to return   a confidence which is shaken the
following year by a new loan  plus the interest on the first  from whom
does he borrow  from the proprietor  the proprietor lends his surplus to
the laborer  and this surplus  which he ought to return  becomes  being
lent at interest  a new source of profit to him  then debts increase
indefinitely  the proprietor makes advances to the producer who never
returns them  and the latter  constantly robbed and constantly borrowing
from the robbers  ends in bankruptcy  defrauded of all that he had 

suppose that the proprietor  who needs his tenant to furnish him with
an income  then releases him from his debts  he will thus do a very
benevolent deed  which will procure for him a recommendation in the
curate s prayers  while the poor tenant  overwhelmed by this unstinted
charity  and taught by his catechism to pray for his benefactors  will
promise to redouble his energy  and suffer new hardships that he may
discharge his debt to so kind a master 

this time he takes precautionary measures  he raises the price of
grains  the manufacturer does the same with his products  the reaction
comes  and  after some fluctuation  the farm rent  which the tenant
thought to put upon the manufacturer s shoulders  becomes nearly
balanced  so that  while he is congratulating himself upon his success 
he finds himself again impoverished  but to an extent somewhat smaller
than before  for the rise having been general  the proprietor suffers
with the rest  so that the laborers  instead of being poorer by
one tenth  lose only nine hundredths  but always it is a debt which
necessitates a loan  the payment of interest  economy  and fasting 
fasting for the nine hundredths which ought not to be paid  and are
paid  fasting for the redemption of debts  fasting to pay the interest
on them  let the crop fail  and the fasting becomes starvation  they
say   it is necessary to work more   that means  obviously  that it is
necessary to produce more  by what conditions is production effected  by
the combined action of labor  capital  and land  as for the labor  the
tenant undertakes to furnish it  but capital is formed only by economy 
now  if the tenant could accumulate any thing  he would pay his debts 
but granting that he has plenty of capital  of what use would it be to
him if the extent of the land which he cultivates always remained the
same  he needs to enlarge his farm 

will it be said  finally  that he must work harder and to better
advantage  but  in our estimation of farm rent  we have assumed the
highest possible average of production  were it not the highest  the
proprietor would increase the farm rent  is not this the way in which
the large landed proprietors have gradually raised their rents  as
fast as they have ascertained by the increase in population and
the development of industry how much society can produce from their
property  the proprietor is a foreigner to society  but  like the
vulture  his eyes fixed upon his prey  he holds himself ready to pounce
upon and devour it 

the facts to which we have called attention  in a community of one
thousand persons  are reproduced on a large scale in every nation
and wherever human beings live  but with infinite variations and in
innumerable forms  which it is no part of my intention to describe 

in fine  property  after having robbed the laborer by usury  murders him
slowly by starvation  now  without robbery and murder  property cannot
exist  with robbery and murder  it soon dies for want of support 
therefore it is impossible 



fifth proposition 


property is impossible  because  if it exists  society devours itself 


when the ass is too heavily loaded  he lies down  man always moves on 
upon this indomitable courage  the proprietor  well knowing that it
exists  bases his hopes of speculation  the free laborer produces ten 
for me  thinks the proprietor  he will produce twelve 

indeed   before consenting to the confiscation of his fields  before
bidding farewell to the paternal roof   the peasant  whose story we have
just told  makes a desperate effort  he leases new land  he will sow
one third more  and  taking half of this new product for himself  he
will harvest an additional sixth  and thereby pay his rent  what an
evil  to add one sixth to his production  the farmer must add  not
one sixth  but two sixths to his labor  at such a price  he pays a
farm rent which in god s eyes he does not owe 

the tenant s example is followed by the manufacturer  the former tills
more land  and dispossesses his neighbors  the latter lowers the price
of his merchandise  and endeavors to monopolize its manufacture and
sale  and to crush out his competitors  to satisfy property  the laborer
must first produce beyond his needs  then  he must produce beyond his
strength  for  by the withdrawal of laborers who become proprietors  the
one always follows from the other  but to produce beyond his strength
and needs  he must invade the production of another  and consequently
diminish the number of producers  thus the proprietor  after having
lessened production by stepping outside  lessens it still further by
encouraging the monopoly of labor  let us calculate it 

the laborer s deficit  after paying his rent  being  as we have seen 
one tenth  he tries to increase his production by this amount  he sees
no way of accomplishing this save by increasing his labor  this also he
does  the discontent of the proprietors who have not received the full
amount of their rent  the advantageous offers and promises made them by
other farmers  whom they suppose more diligent  more industrious  and
more reliable  the secret plots and intrigues   all these give rise to a
movement for the re division of labor  and the elimination of a certain
number of producers  out of nine hundred  ninety will be ejected  that
the production of the others may be increased one tenth  but will
the total product be increased  not in the least  there will be eight
hundred and ten laborers producing as nine hundred  while  to accomplish
their purpose  they would have to produce as one thousand  now  it
having been proved that farm rent is proportional to the landed capital
instead of to labor  and that it never diminishes  the debts must
continue as in the past  while the labor has increased  here  then  we
have a society which is continually decimating itself  and which
would destroy itself  did not the periodical occurrence of failures 
bankruptcies  and political and economical catastrophes re establish
equilibrium  and distract attention from the real causes of the
universal distress 

the monopoly of land and capital is followed by economical processes
which also result in throwing laborers out of employment  interest being
a constant burden upon the shoulders of the farmer and the manufacturer 
they exclaim  each speaking for himself   i should have the means
wherewith to pay my rent and interest  had i not to pay so many hands  
then those admirable inventions  intended to assure the easy and speedy
performance of labor  become so many infernal machines which kill
laborers by thousands 


 a few years ago  the countess of strafford ejected fifteen thousand
persons from her estate  who  as tenants  added to its value  this act
of private administration was repeated in 1820  by another large scotch
proprietor  towards six hundred tenants and their families    tissot  on
suicide and revolt 

   the author whom i quote  and who has written eloquent words
concerning the revolutionary spirit which prevails in modern society 
does not say whether he would have disapproved of a revolt on the part
of these exiles  for myself  i avow boldly that in my eyes it would
have been the first of rights  and the holiest of duties  and all that i
desire to day is that my profession of faith be understood 

society devours itself   1  by the violent and periodical sacrifice
of laborers  this we have just seen  and shall see again  2  by the
stoppage of the producer s consumption caused by property  these two
modes of suicide are at first simultaneous  but soon the first is given
additional force by the second  famine uniting with usury to render
labor at once more necessary and more scarce 

by the principles of commerce and political economy  that an industrial
enterprise may be successful  its product must furnish   1  the interest
on the capital employed  2  means for the preservation of this capital 
3  the wages of all the employees and contractors  further  as large a
profit as possible must be realized 

the financial shrewdness and rapacity of property is worthy of
admiration  each different name which increase takes affords the
proprietor an opportunity to receive it   1  in the form of interest  2 
in the form of profit  for  it says  a part of the income derived
from manufactures consists of interest on the capital employed  if
one hundred thousand francs have been invested in a manufacturing
enterprise  and in a year s time five thousand francs have been received
therefrom in addition to the expenses  there has been no profit  but
only interest on the capital  now  the proprietor is not a man to labor
for nothing  like the lion in the fable  he gets paid in each of his
capacities  so that  after he has been served  nothing is left for his
associates 

          ego primam tollo  nominor quia leo 
          secundam quia sum fortis tribuctis mihi 
          tum quia plus valeo  me sequetur tertia 
          malo adficietur  si quis quartam tetigerit  


i know nothing prettier than this fable 

           i am the contractor   i take the first share 
           i am the laborer  i take the second 
           i am the capitalist  i take the third 
           i am the proprietor  i take the whole  


in four lines  phaedrus has summed up all the forms of property 

i say that this interest  all the more then this profit  is impossible 

what are laborers in relation to each other  so many members of a large
industrial society  to each of whom is assigned a certain portion of
the general production  by the principle of the division of labor and
functions  suppose  first  that this society is composed of but three
individuals   a cattle raiser  a tanner  and a shoemaker  the social
industry  then  is that of shoemaking  if i should ask what ought to be
each producer s share of the social product  the first schoolboy whom i
should meet would answer  by a rule of commerce and association  that it
should be one third  but it is not our duty here to balance the rights
of laborers conventionally associated  we have to prove that  whether
associated or not  our three workers are obliged to act as if they
were  that  whether they will or no  they are associated by the force of
things  by mathematical necessity 

three processes are required in the manufacture of shoes   the rearing
of cattle  the preparation of their hides  and the cutting and sewing 
if the hide  on leaving the farmer s stable  is worth one  it is worth
two on leaving the tanner s pit  and three on leaving the shoemaker s
shop  each laborer has produced a portion of the utility  so that  by
adding all these portions together  we get the value of the article  to
obtain any quantity whatever of this article  each producer must pay 
then  first for his own labor  and second for the labor of the other
producers  thus  to obtain as many shoes as can be made from ten hides 
the farmer will give thirty raw hides  and the tanner twenty tanned
hides  for  the shoes that are made from ten hides are worth thirty raw
hides  in consequence of the extra labor bestowed upon them  just
as twenty tanned hides are worth thirty raw hides  on account of
the tanner s labor  but if the shoemaker demands thirty three in the
farmer s product  or twenty two in the tanner s  for ten in his own 
there will be no exchange  for  if there were  the farmer and the
tanner  after having paid the shoemaker ten for his labor  would have to
pay eleven for that which they had themselves sold for ten   which  of
course  would be impossible   18 


well  this is precisely what happens whenever an emolument of any kind
is received  be it called revenue  farm rent  interest  or profit  in
the little community of which we are speaking  if the shoemaker  in
order to procure tools  buy a stock of leather  and support himself
until he receives something from his investment  borrows money at
interest  it is clear that to pay this interest he will have to make a
profit off the tanner and the farmer  but as this profit is impossible
unless fraud is used  the interest will fall back upon the shoulders of
the unfortunate shoemaker  and ruin him 

i have imagined a case of unnatural simplicity  there is no human
society but sustains more than three vocations  the most uncivilized
society supports numerous industries  to day  the number of industrial
functions  i mean by industrial functions all useful functions  exceeds 
perhaps  a thousand  however numerous the occupations  the economic law
remains the same   that the producer may live  his wages must repurchase
his product 

   the economists cannot be ignorant of this rudimentary principle
of their pretended science  why  then  do they so obstinately defend
property  and inequality of wages  and the legitimacy of usury  and the
honesty of profit   all of which contradict the economic law  and make
exchange impossible  a contractor pays one hundred thousand francs
for raw material  fifty thousand francs in wages  and then expects to
receive a product of two hundred thousand francs   that is  expects to
make a profit on the material and on the labor of his employees  but
if the laborers and the purveyor of the material cannot  with their
combined wages  repurchase that which they have produced for the
contractor  how can they live  i will develop my question  here details
become necessary 

if the workingman receives for his labor an average of three francs per
day  his employer  in order to gain any thing beyond his own salary  if
only interest on his capital  must sell the day s labor of his employee 
in the form of merchandise  for more than three francs  the workingman
cannot  then  repurchase that which he has produced for his master 
it is thus with all trades whatsoever  the tailor  the hatter  the
cabinet maker  the blacksmith  the tanner  the mason  the jeweller 
the printer  the clerk  &c   even to the farmer and wine grower  cannot
repurchase their products  since  producing for a master who in one form
or another makes a profit  they are obliged to pay more for their own
labor than they get for it 

in france  twenty millions of laborers  engaged in all the branches of
science  art  and industry  produce every thing which is useful to man 
their annual wages amount  it is estimated to twenty thousand millions 
but  in consequence of the right of property  and the multifarious forms
of increase  premiums  tithes  interests  fines  profits  farm rents 
house rents  revenues  emoluments of every nature and description  their
products are estimated by the proprietors and employers at twenty five
thousand millions  what does that signify  that the laborers  who are
obliged to repurchase these products in order to live  must either pay
five for that which they produced for four  or fast one day in five 

if there is an economist in france able to show that this calculation is
false  i summon him to appear  and i promise to retract all that i have
wrongfully and wickedly uttered in my attacks upon property 

let us now look at the results of this profit 

if the wages of the workingmen were the same in all pursuits  the
deficit caused by the proprietor s tax would be felt equally everywhere 
but also the cause of the evil would be so apparent  that it would soon
be discovered and suppressed  but  as there is the same inequality of
wages  from that of the scavenger up to that of the minister of state 
as of property  robbery continually rebounds from the stronger to the
weaker  so that  since the laborer finds his hardships increase as he
descends in the social scale  the lowest class of people are literally
stripped naked and eaten alive by the others 

the laboring people can buy neither the cloth which they weave  nor the
furniture which they manufacture  nor the metal which they forge  nor
the jewels which they cut  nor the prints which they engrave  they can
procure neither the wheat which they plant  nor the wine which they
grow  nor the flesh of the animals which they raise  they are allowed
neither to dwell in the houses which they build  nor to attend the
plays which their labor supports  nor to enjoy the rest which their body
requires  and why  because the right of increase does not permit these
things to be sold at the cost price  which is all that laborers can
afford to pay  on the signs of those magnificent warehouses which he in
his poverty admires  the laborer reads in large letters   this is thy
work  and thou shalt not have it    sic vos non vobis  

every manufacturer who employs one thousand laborers  and gains from
them daily one sou each  is slowly pushing them into a state of misery 
every man who makes a profit has entered into a conspiracy with famine 
but the whole nation has not even this labor  by means of which property
starves it  and why  because the workers are forced by the insufficiency
of their wages to monopolize labor  and because  before being destroyed
by dearth  they destroy each other by competition  let us pursue this
truth no further 

if the laborer s wages will not purchase his product  it follows
that the product is not made for the producer  for whom  then  is it
intended  for the richer consumer  that is  for only a fraction of
society  but when the whole society labors  it produces for the whole
society  if  then  only a part of society consumes  sooner or later a
part of society will be idle  now  idleness is death  as well for the
laborer as for the proprietor 

this conclusion is inevitable 

the most distressing spectacle imaginable is the sight of producers
resisting and struggling against this mathematical necessity  this power
of figures to which their prejudices blind them 

if one hundred thousand printers can furnish reading matter enough for
thirty four millions of men  and if the price of books is so high that
only one third of that number can afford to buy them  it is clear that
these one hundred thousand printers will produce three times as much as
the booksellers can sell  that the products of the laborers may never
exceed the demands of the consumers  the laborers must either rest two
days out of three  or  separating into three groups  relieve each other
three times a week  month  or quarter  that is  during two thirds of
their life they must not live  but industry  under the influence of
property  does not proceed with such regularity  it endeavors to
produce a great deal in a short time  because the greater the amount of
products  and the shorter the time of production  the less each product
costs  as soon as a demand begins to be felt  the factories fill up  and
everybody goes to work  then business is lively  and both governors and
governed rejoice  but the more they work to day  the more idle will they
be hereafter  the more they laugh  the more they shall weep  under
the rule of property  the flowers of industry are woven into none but
funeral wreaths  the laborer digs his own grave 

if the factory stops running  the manufacturer has to pay interest on
his capital the same as before  he naturally tries  then  to continue
production by lessening expenses  then comes the lowering of wages  the
introduction of machinery  the employment of women and children to do
the work of men  bad workmen  and wretched work  they still produce 
because the decreased cost creates a larger market  but they do not
produce long  because  the cheapness being due to the quantity and
rapidity of production  the productive power tends more than ever to
outstrip consumption  it is when laborers  whose wages are scarcely
sufficient to support them from one day to another  are thrown out of
work  that the consequences of the principle of property become most
frightful  they have not been able to economize  they have made no
savings  they have accumulated no capital whatever to support them even
one day more  today the factory is closed  to morrow the people starve
in the streets  day after tomorrow they will either die in the hospital 
or eat in the jail 

and still new misfortunes come to complicate this terrible situation  in
consequence of the cessation of business  and the extreme cheapness of
merchandise  the manufacturer finds it impossible to pay the interest
on his borrowed capital  whereupon his frightened creditors hasten to
withdraw their funds  production is suspended  and labor comes to a
standstill  then people are astonished to see capital desert commerce 
and throw itself upon the stock exchange  and i once heard m  blanqui
bitterly lamenting the blind ignorance of capitalists  the cause of
this movement of capital is very simple  but for that very reason an
economist could not understand it  or rather must not explain it  the
cause lies solely in competition 

i mean by competition  not only the rivalry between two parties engaged
in the same business  but the general and simultaneous effort of all
kinds of business to get ahead of each other  this effort is to day
so strong  that the price of merchandise scarcely covers the cost of
production and distribution  so that  the wages of all laborers being
lessened  nothing remains  not even interest for the capitalists 

the primary cause of commercial and industrial stagnations is  then 
interest on capital   that interest which the ancients with one accord
branded with the name of usury  whenever it was paid for the use
of money  but which they did not dare to condemn in the forms of
house rent  farm rent  or profit  as if the nature of the thing lent
could ever warrant a charge for the lending  that is  robbery 

in proportion to the increase received by the capitalist will be the
frequency and intensity of commercial crises   the first being given  we
always can determine the two others  and vice versa  do you wish to know
the regulator of a society  ascertain the amount of active capital  that
is  the capital bearing interest  and the legal rate of this interest 
the course of events will be a series of overturns  whose number and
violence will be proportional to the activity of capital 

in 1839  the number of failures in paris alone was one thousand and
sixty four  this proportion was kept up in the early months of 1840 
and  as i write these lines  the crisis is not yet ended  it is said 
further  that the number of houses which have wound up their business
is greater than the number of declared failures  by this flood  we may
judge of the waterspout s power of suction 

the decimation of society is now imperceptible and permanent  now
periodical and violent  it depends upon the course which property takes 
in a country where the property is pretty evenly distributed  and where
little business is done   the rights and claims of each being balanced
by those of others   the power of invasion is destroyed  there  it may
be truly said  property does not exist  since the right of increase is
scarcely exercised at all  the condition of the laborers  as regards
security of life  is almost the same as if absolute equality prevailed
among them  they are deprived of all the advantages of full and free
association  but their existence is not endangered in the least  with
the exception of a few isolated victims of the right of property  of
this misfortune whose primary cause no one perceives  the society
appears to rest calmly in the bosom of this sort of equality  but have a
care  it is balanced on the edge of a sword  at the slightest shock  it
will fall and meet with death 

ordinarily  the whirlpool of property localizes itself  on the one hand 
farm rent stops at a certain point  on the other  in consequence of
competition and over production  the price of manufactured goods does
not rise   so that the condition of the peasant varies but little  and
depends mainly on the seasons  the devouring action of property bears 
then  principally upon business  we commonly say commercial crises  not
agricultural crises  because  while the farmer is eaten up slowly by the
right of increase  the manufacturer is swallowed at a single mouthful 
this leads to the cessation of business  the destruction of fortunes 
and the inactivity of the working people  who die one after another on
the highways  and in the hospitals  prisons  and galleys 

to sum up this proposition   

property sells products to the laborer for more than it pays him for
them  therefore it is impossible 



appendix to the fifth proposition 


i  certain reformers  and even the most of the publicists  who  though
belonging to no particular school  busy themselves in devising means for
the amelioration of the lot of the poorer and more numerous class  lay
much stress now a days on a better organization of labor  the disciples
of fourier  especially  never stop shouting   on to the phalanx  
declaiming in the same breath against the foolishness and absurdity of
other sects 

they consist of half a dozen incomparable geniuses who have discovered
that five and four make nine  take two away  and nine remain   and
who weep over the blindness of france  who refuses to believe in this
astonishing arithmetic  1 

 1  fourier  having to multiply a whole number by a fraction 
never failed  they say  to obtain a product much greater than the
multiplicand  he affirmed that under his system of harmony the mercury
would solidify when the temperature was above zero  he might as well
have said that the harmonians would make burning ice  i once asked an
intelligent phalansterian what he thought of such physics   i do not
know   he answered   but i believe   and yet the same man disbelieved in
the doctrine of the real presence 


in fact  the fourierists proclaim themselves  on the one hand  defenders
of property  of the right of increase  which they have thus formulated 
to each according to his capital  his labor  and his skill  on the other
hand  they wish the workingman to come into the enjoyment of all
the wealth of society  that is   abridging the expression   into the
undivided enjoyment of his own product  is not this like saying to the
workingman   labor  you shall have three francs per day  you shall live
on fifty five sous  you shall give the rest to the proprietor  and thus
you will consume three francs  

if the above speech is not an exact epitome of charles fourier s system 
i will subscribe to the whole phalansterian folly with a pen dipped in
my own blood 

of what use is it to reform industry and agriculture   of what use 
indeed  to labor at all   if property is maintained  and labor can never
meet its expenses  without the abolition of property  the organization
of labor is neither more nor less than a delusion  if production should
be quadrupled   a thing which does not seem to me at all impossible   it
would be labor lost  if the additional product was not consumed  it
would be of no value  and the proprietor would decline to receive it as
interest  if it was consumed  all the disadvantages of property would
reappear  it must be confessed that the theory of passional attraction
is gravely at fault in this particular  and that fourier  when he tried
to harmonize the passion for property   a bad passion  whatever he may
say to the contrary   blocked his own chariot wheels 

the absurdity of the phalansterian economy is so gross  that many people
suspect fourier  in spite of all the homage paid by him to proprietors 
of having been a secret enemy of property  this opinion might be
supported by plausible arguments  still it is not mine  charlatanism
was too important a part for such a man to play  and sincerity too
insignificant a one  i would rather think fourier ignorant  which is
generally admitted  than disingenuous  as for his disciples  before they
can formulate any opinion of their own  they must declare once for
all  unequivocally and with no mental reservation  whether they mean to
maintain property or not  and what they mean by their famous motto    to
each according to his capital  his labor  and his skill  

ii  but  some half converted proprietor will observe   would it not be
possible  by suppressing the bank  incomes  farm rent  house rent  usury
of all kinds  and finally property itself  to proportion products to
capacities  that was st  simon s idea  it was also fourier s  it is the
desire of the human conscience  and no decent person would dare maintain
that a minister of state should live no better than a peasant  

o midas  your ears are long  what  will you never understand that
disparity of wages and the right of increase are one and the same 
certainly  st  simon  fourier  and their respective flocks committed
a serious blunder in attempting to unite  the one  inequality and
communism  the other  inequality and property  but you  a man of
figures  a man of economy   you  who know by heart your logarithmic
tables   how can you make so stupid a mistake 

does not political economy itself teach you that the product of a man 
whatever be his individual capacity  is never worth more than his labor 
and that a man s labor is worth no more than his consumption  you remind
me of that great constitution framer  poor pinheiro ferreira  the sieyes
of the nineteenth century  who  dividing the citizens of a nation into
twelve classes   or  if you prefer  into twelve grades   assigned to
some a salary of one hundred thousand francs each  to others  eighty
thousand  then twenty five thousand  fifteen thousand  ten thousand 
&c   down to one thousand five hundred  and one thousand francs  the
minimum allowance of a citizen  pinheiro loved distinctions  and could
no more conceive of a state without great dignitaries than of an army
without drum majors  and as he also loved  or thought he loved  liberty 
equality  and fraternity  he combined the good and the evil of our old
society in an eclectic philosophy which he embodied in a constitution 
excellent pinheiro  liberty even to passive submission  fraternity
even to identity of language  equality even in the jury box and at the
guillotine   such was his ideal republic  unappreciated genius  of whom
the present century was unworthy  but whom the future will avenge 

listen  proprietor  inequality of talent exists in fact  in right it is
not admissible  it goes for nothing  it is not thought of  one newton in
a century is equal to thirty millions of men  the psychologist admires
the rarity of so fine a genius  the legislator sees only the rarity
of the function  now  rarity of function bestows no privilege upon the
functionary  and that for several reasons  all equally forcible 

1  rarity of genius was not  in the creator s design  a motive to compel
society to go down on its knees before the man of superior talents 
but a providential means for the performance of all functions to the
greatest advantage of all 

2  talent is a creation of society rather than a gift of nature  it
is an accumulated capital  of which the receiver is only the guardian 
without society   without the education and powerful assistance which
it furnishes   the finest nature would be inferior to the most ordinary
capacities in the very respect in which it ought to shine  the more
extensive a man s knowledge  the more luxuriant his imagination  the
more versatile his talent   the more costly has his education been  the
more remarkable and numerous were his teachers and his models  and the
greater is his debt  the farmer produces from the time that he leaves
his cradle until he enters his grave  the fruits of art and science
are late and scarce  frequently the tree dies before the fruit ripens 
society  in cultivating talent  makes a sacrifice to hope 

3  capacities have no common standard of comparison  the conditions of
development being equal  inequality of talent is simply speciality of
talent 

4  inequality of wages  like the right of increase  is economically
impossible  take the most favorable case   that where each laborer
has furnished his maximum production  that there may be an equitable
distribution of products  the share of each must be equal to the
quotient of the total production divided by the number of laborers  this
done  what remains wherewith to pay the higher wages  nothing whatever 

will it be said that all laborers should be taxed  but  then  their
consumption will not be equal to their production  their wages will not
pay for their productive service  they will not be able to repurchase
their product  and we shall once more be afflicted with all the
calamities of property  i do not speak of the injustice done to
the defrauded laborer  of rivalry  of excited ambition  and burning
hatred   these may all be important considerations  but they do not hit
the point 

on the one hand  each laborer s task being short and easy  and the means
for its successful accomplishment being equal in all cases  how could
there be large and small producers  on the other hand  all functions
being equal  either on account of the actual equivalence of talents
and capacities  or on account of social co operation  how could a
functionary claim a salary proportional to the worth of his genius 

but  what do i say  in equality wages are always proportional to
talents  what is the economical meaning of wages  the reproductive
consumption of the laborer  the very act by which the laborer produces
constitutes  then  this consumption  exactly equal to his production 
of which we are speaking  when the astronomer produces observations  the
poet verses  or the savant experiments  they consume instruments  books 
travels  &c   &c   now  if society supplies this consumption  what more
can the astronomer  the savant  or the poet demand  we must conclude 
then  that in equality  and only in equality  st  simon s adage  to
each according to his capacity to each capacity according to its
results  finds its full and complete application 

iii  the great evil  the horrible and ever present evil  arising from
property  is that  while property exists  population  however reduced 
is  and always must be  over abundant  complaints have been made in
all ages of the excess of population  in all ages property has been
embarrassed by the presence of pauperism  not perceiving that it caused
it  further   nothing is more curious than the diversity of the plans
proposed for its extermination  their atrocity is equalled only by their
absurdity 

the ancients made a practice of abandoning their children  the wholesale
and retail slaughter of slaves  civil and foreign wars  also lent their
aid  in rome  where property held full sway   these three means were
employed so effectively  and for so long a time  that finally the empire
found itself without inhabitants  when the barbarians arrived  nobody
was to be found  the fields were no longer cultivated  grass grew in the
streets of the italian cities 

in china  from time immemorial  upon famine alone has devolved the task
of sweeping away the poor  the people living almost exclusively upon
rice  if an accident causes the crop to fail  in a few days hunger kills
the inhabitants by myriads  and the chinese historian records in the
annals of the empire  that in such a year of such an emperor twenty 
thirty  fifty  one hundred thousand inhabitants died of starvation 
then they bury the dead  and recommence the production of children until
another famine leads to the same result  such appears to have been  in
all ages  the confucian economy 

i borrow the following facts from a modern economist   


 since the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries  england has been
preyed upon by pauperism  at that time beggars were punished by law  
nevertheless  she had not one fourth as large a population as she has
to day 

 edward prohibits alms giving  on pain of imprisonment     the laws of
1547 and 1656 prescribe a like punishment  in case of a second offence 
elizabeth orders that each parish shall support its own paupers  but
what is a pauper  charles ii  decides that an undisputed residence of
forty days constitutes a settlement in a parish  but  if disputed  the
new comer is forced to pack off  james ii  modifies this decision 
which is again modified by william  in the midst of trials  reports  and
modifications  pauperism increases  and the workingman languishes and
dies 

 the poor tax in 1774 exceeded forty millions of francs  in 1783 4 5 
it averaged fifty three millions  1813  more than a hundred and
eighty seven millions five hundred thousand francs  1816  two hundred
and fifty millions  in 1817  it is estimated at three hundred and
seventeen millions 

 in 1821  the number of paupers enrolled upon the parish lists was
estimated at four millions  nearly one third of the population 

 france  in 1544  francis i  establishes a compulsory tax in behalf of
the poor  in 1566 and 1586  the same principle is applied to the whole
kingdom 

 under louis xiv   forty thousand paupers infested the capital  as many
in proportion as to day   mendicity was punished severely  in 1740 
the parliament of paris re establishes within its own jurisdiction the
compulsory assessment 

 the constituent assembly  frightened at the extent of the evil and the
difficulty of curing it  ordains the  statu quo  

 the convention proclaims assistance of the poor to be a national debt 
its law remains unexecuted 

 napoleon also wishes to remedy the evil  his idea is imprisonment   in
that way   said he   i shall protect the rich from the importunity
of beggars  and shall relieve them of the disgusting sight of abject
poverty    o wonderful man 


from these facts  which i might multiply still farther  two things are
to be inferred   the one  that pauperism is independent of population 
the other  that all attempts hitherto made at its extermination have
proved abortive 

catholicism founds hospitals and convents  and commands charity  that
is  she encourages mendicity  that is the extent of her insight as
voiced by her priests 

the secular power of christian nations now orders taxes on the rich 
now banishment and imprisonment for the poor  that is  on the one hand 
violation of the right of property  and  on the other  civil death and
murder 

the modern economists  thinking that pauperism is caused by the excess
of population  exclusively  have devoted themselves to devising checks 
some wish to prohibit the poor from marrying  thus   having denounced
religious celibacy   they propose compulsory celibacy  which will
inevitably become licentious celibacy 

others do not approve this method  which they deem too violent  and
which  they say  deprives the poor man of the only pleasure which he
knows in this world  they would simply recommend him to be prudent  this
opinion is held by malthus  sismondi  say  droz  duchatel  &c  but if
the poor are to be prudent  the rich must set the example  why should
the marriageable age of the latter be fixed at eighteen years  while
that of the former is postponed until thirty 


again  they would do well to explain clearly what they mean by this
matrimonial prudence which they so urgently recommend to the laborer 
for here equivocation is especially dangerous  and i suspect that
the economists are not thoroughly understood   some half enlightened
ecclesiastics are alarmed when they hear prudence in marriage advised 
they fear that the divine injunction  increase and multiply  is to be
set aside  to be logical  they must anathematize bachelors    j  droz 
political economy  

m  droz is too honest a man  and too little of a theologian  to see why
these casuists are so alarmed  and this chaste ignorance is the very
best evidence of the purity of his heart  religion never has encouraged
early marriages  and the kind of prudence which it condemns is that
described in this latin sentence from sanchez    an licet ob metum
liberorum semen extra vas ejicere  

destutt de tracy seems to dislike prudence in either form  he says   i
confess that i no more share the desire of the moralists to diminish
and restrain our pleasures  than that of the politicians to increase
our procreative powers  and accelerate reproduction   he believes  then 
that we should love and marry when and as we please  widespread misery
results from love and marriage  but this our philosopher does not heed 
true to the dogma of the necessity of evil  to evil he looks for the
solution of all problems  he adds   the multiplication of men continuing
in all classes of society  the surplus members of the upper classes are
supported by the lower classes  and those of the latter are destroyed
by poverty   this philosophy has few avowed partisans  but it has over
every other the indisputable advantage of demonstration in practice  not
long since france heard it advocated in the chamber of deputies  in the
course of the discussion on the electoral reform   poverty will always
exist  that is the political aphorism with which the minister of state
ground to powder the arguments of m  arago  poverty will always exist 
yes  so long as property does 

the fourierists  inventors of so many marvellous contrivances  could
not  in this field  belie their character  they invented four methods of
checking increase of population at will 

1  the vigor of women  on this point they are contradicted by
experience  for  although vigorous women may be less likely to conceive 
nevertheless they give birth to the healthiest children  so that the
advantage of maternity is on their side 

2  integral exercise  or the equal development of all the physical
powers  if this development is equal  how is the power of reproduction
lessened 

3  the gastronomic regime  or  in plain english  the philosophy of the
belly  the fourierists say  that abundance of rich food renders
women sterile  just as too much sap  while enhancing the beauty of
flowers  destroys their reproductive capacity  but the analogy is a
false one  flowers become sterile when the stamens  or male organs  are
changed into petals  as may be seen by inspecting a rose  and when
through excessive dampness the pollen loses its fertilizing power 
then   in order that the gastronomic regime may produce the results
claimed for it   not only must the females be fattened  but the males
must be rendered impotent 

4  phanerogamic morality  or public concubinage  i know not why the
phalansterians use greek words to convey ideas which can be expressed so
clearly in french  this method  like the preceding one  is copied from
civilized customs  fourier  himself  cites the example of prostitutes
as a proof  now we have no certain knowledge yet of the facts which he
quotes  so states parent duchatelet in his work on  prostitution  

from all the information which i have been able to gather  i find that
all the remedies for pauperism and fecundity  sanctioned by universal
practice  philosophy  political economy  and the latest reformers  may
be summed up in the following list  masturbation  onanism   19 
sodomy  tribadie  polyandry   20  prostitution  castration  continence 
abortion  and infanticide   21 


all these methods being proved inadequate  there remains proscription 

unfortunately  proscription  while decreasing the number of the poor 
increases their proportion  if the interest charged by the proprietor
upon the product is equal only to one twentieth of the product  by law
it is equal to one twentieth of the capital   it follows that twenty
laborers produce for nineteen only  because there is one among them 
called proprietor  who eats the share of two  suppose that the twentieth
laborer  the poor one  is killed  the production of the following year
will be diminished one twentieth  consequently the nineteenth will have
to yield his portion  and perish  for  since it is not one twentieth
of the product of nineteen which must be paid to the proprietor  but
one twentieth of the product of twenty  see third proposition   each
surviving laborer must sacrifice one twentieth plus one four hundredth
of his product  in other words  one man out of nineteen must be killed 
therefore  while property exists  the more poor people we kill  the more
there are born in proportion 

malthus  who proved so clearly that population increases in geometrical
progression  while production increases only in arithmetical
progression  did not notice this pauperizing power of property  had he
observed this  he would have understood that  before trying to check
reproduction  the right of increase should be abolished  because 
wherever that right is tolerated  there are always too many inhabitants 
whatever the extent or fertility of the soil 

it will be asked  perhaps  how i would maintain a balance between
population and production  for sooner or later this problem must be
solved  the reader will pardon me  if i do not give my method here  for 
in my opinion  it is useless to say a thing unless we prove it  now  to
explain my method fully would require no less than a formal treatise 
it is a thing so simple and so vast  so common and so extraordinary 
so true and so misunderstood  so sacred and so profane  that to name it
without developing and proving it would serve only to excite contempt
and incredulity  one thing at a time  let us establish equality  and
this remedy will soon appear  for truths follow each other  just as
crimes and errors do 



sixth proposition 

property is impossible  because it is the mother of tyranny 


what is government  government is public economy  the supreme
administrative power over public works and national possessions 

now  the nation is like a vast society in which all the citizens are
stockholders  each one has a deliberative voice in the assembly  and 
if the shares are equal  has one vote at his disposal  but  under the
regime of property  there is great inequality between the shares of
the stockholders  therefore  one may have several hundred votes  while
another has only one  if  for example  i enjoy an income of one million 
that is  if i am the proprietor of a fortune of thirty or forty millions
well invested  and if this fortune constitutes 1/30000 of the national
capital   it is clear that the public administration of my property
would form 1/30000 of the duties of the government  and  if the nation
had a population of thirty four millions  that i should have as many
votes as one thousand one hundred and thirty three simple stockholders 

thus  when m  arago demands the right of suffrage for all members of the
national guard  he is perfectly right  since every citizen is enrolled
for at least one national share  which entitles him to one vote  but the
illustrious orator ought at the same time to demand that each elector
shall have as many votes as he has shares  as is the case in commercial
associations  for to do otherwise is to pretend that the nation has a
right to dispose of the property of individuals without consulting them 
which is contrary to the right of property  in a country where property
exists  equality of electoral rights is a violation of property 

now  if each citizen s sovereignty must and ought to be proportional to
his property  it follows that the small stock holders are at the mercy
of the larger ones  who will  as soon as they choose  make slaves of
the former  marry them at pleasure  take from them their wives 
castrate their sons  prostitute their daughters  throw the aged to the
sharks   and finally will be forced to serve themselves in the same way 
unless they prefer to tax themselves for the support of their servants 
in such a condition is great britain to day  john bull  caring little
for liberty  equality  or dignity  prefers to serve and beg  but you 
bonhomme jacques 

property is incompatible with political and civil equality  then
property is impossible 

historical comments   1  when the vote of the third estate was doubled
by the states general of 1789  property was grossly violated  the
nobility and the clergy possessed three fourths of the soil of france 
they should have controlled three fourths of the votes in the national
representation  to double the vote of the third estate was just  it is
said  since the people paid nearly all the taxes  this argument would
be sound  if there were nothing to be voted upon but taxes  but it was a
question at that time of reforming the government and the constitution 
consequently  the doubling of the vote of the third estate was a
usurpation  and an attack on property 

2  if the present representatives of the radical opposition should
come into power  they would work a reform by which every national guard
should be an elector  and every elector eligible for office   an attack
on property 

they would lower the rate of interest on public funds   an attack on
property 

they would  in the interest of the public  pass laws to regulate the
exportation of cattle and wheat   an attack on property 

they would alter the assessment of taxes   an attack on property 

they would educate the people gratuitously   a conspiracy against
property 

they would organize labor  that is  they would guarantee labor to the
workingman  and give him a share in the profits   the abolition of
property 

now  these same radicals are zealous defenders of property   a radical
proof that they know not what they do  nor what they wish 

3  since property is the grand cause of privilege and despotism  the
form of the republican oath should be changed  instead of   i swear
hatred to royalty   henceforth the new member of a secret society should
say   i swear hatred to property  



seventh proposition 

 property is impossible  because  in consuming its receipts  it loses
them  in hoarding them  it nullifies them  and in using them as capital 
it turns them against production  

i  if  with the economists  we consider the laborer as a living machine 
we must regard the wages paid to him as the amount necessary to support
this machine  and keep it in repair  the head of a manufacturing
establishment  who employs laborers at three  five  ten  and
fifteen francs per day  and who charges twenty francs for his
superintendence  does not regard his disbursements as losses  because
he knows they will return to him in the form of products  consequently 
labor and reproductive consumption are identical 

what is the proprietor  he is a machine which does not work  or  which
working for its own pleasure  and only when it sees fit  produces
nothing 

what is it to consume as a proprietor  it is to consume without
working  to consume without reproducing  for  once more  that which the
proprietor consumes as a laborer comes back to him  he does not give his
labor in exchange for his property  since  if he did  he would thereby
cease to be a proprietor  in consuming as a laborer  the proprietor
gains  or at least does not lose  since he recovers that which he
consumes  in consuming as a proprietor  he impoverishes himself  to
enjoy property  then  it is necessary to destroy it  to be a real
proprietor  one must cease to be a proprietor 

the laborer who consumes his wages is a machine which destroys and
reproduces  the proprietor who consumes his income is a bottomless
gulf   sand which we water  a stone which we sow  so true is this 
that the proprietor  neither wishing nor knowing how to produce  and
perceiving that as fast as he uses his property he destroys it for
ever  has taken the precaution to make some one produce in his place 
that is what political economy  speaking in the name of eternal justice 
calls producing by his capital   producing by his tools  and that is
what ought to be called producing by a slave  producing as a thief and
as a tyrant  he  the proprietor  produce     the robber might say  as
well   i produce  

the consumption of the proprietor has been styled luxury  in opposition
to useful consumption  from what has just been said  we see that great
luxury can prevail in a nation which is not rich   that poverty even
increases with luxury  and vice versa  the economists  so much credit
must be given them  at least  have caused such a horror of luxury 
that to day a very large number of proprietors  not to say almost
all  ashamed of their idleness  labor  economize  and capitalize  they
have jumped from the frying pan into the fire 

i cannot repeat it too often  the proprietor who thinks to deserve
his income by working  and who receives wages for his labor  is a
functionary who gets paid twice  that is the only difference between an
idle proprietor and a laboring proprietor  by his labor  the proprietor
produces his wages only  not his income  and since his condition enables
him to engage in the most lucrative pursuits  it may be said that the
proprietor s labor harms society more than it helps it  whatever the
proprietor does  the consumption of his income is an actual loss  which
his salaried functions neither repair nor justify  and which would
annihilate property  were it not continually replenished by outside
production 

ii  then  the proprietor who consumes annihilates the product  he does
much worse if he lays it up  the things which he lays by pass into
another world  nothing more is seen of them  not even the  caput
mortuum    the smoke  if we had some means of transportation by which
to travel to the moon  and if the proprietors should be seized with a
sudden fancy to carry their savings thither  at the end of a certain
time our terraqueous planet would be transported by them to its
satellite 

the proprietor who lays up products will neither allow others to enjoy
them  nor enjoy them himself  for him there is neither possession nor
property  like the miser  he broods over his treasures  he does not use
them  he may feast his eyes upon them  he may lie down with them  he
may sleep with them in his arms  all very fine  but coins do not
breed coins  no real property without enjoyment  no enjoyment without
consumption  no consumption without loss of property   such is the
inflexible necessity to which god s judgment compels the proprietor to
bend  a curse upon property 

iii  the proprietor who  instead of consuming his income  uses it as
capital  turns it against production  and thereby makes it impossible
for him to exercise his right  for the more he increases the amount of
interest to be paid upon it  the more he is compelled to diminish wages 
now  the more he diminishes wages   that is  the less he devotes to
the maintenance and repair of the machines   the more he diminishes
the quantity of labor  and with the quantity of labor the quantity of
product  and with the quantity of product the very source of his income 
this is clearly shown by the following example   

take an estate consisting of arable land  meadows  and vineyards 
containing the dwellings of the owner and the tenant  and worth 
together with the farming implements  one hundred thousand francs  the
rate of increase being three per cent  if  instead of consuming his
revenue  the proprietor uses it  not in enlarging but in beautifying his
estate  can he annually demand of his tenant an additional ninety francs
on account of the three thousand francs which he has thus added to
his capital  certainly not  for on such conditions the tenant  though
producing no more than before  would soon be obliged to labor for
nothing   what do i say  to actually suffer loss in order to hold his
lease 

in fact  revenue can increase only as productive soil increases  it
is useless to build walls of marble  and work with plows of gold  but 
since it is impossible to go on acquiring for ever  to add estate to
estate  to continue one s possessions  as the latins said  and since 
moreover  the proprietor always has means wherewith to capitalize   it
follows that the exercise of his right finally becomes impossible 

well  in spite of this impossibility  property capitalizes  and in
capitalizing increases its revenue  and  without stopping to look at the
particular cases which occur in commerce  manufacturing operations 
and banking  i will cite a graver fact   one which directly affects all
citizens  i mean the indefinite increase of the budget 

the taxes increase every year  it would be difficult to tell in which
department of the government the expenses increase  for who can boast
of any knowledge as to the budget  on this point  the ablest financiers
continually disagree  what is to be thought  i ask  of the science of
government  when its professors cannot understand one another s figures 
whatever be the immediate causes of this growth of the budget  it is
certain that taxation increases at a rate which causes everybody to
despair  everybody sees it  everybody acknowledges it  but nobody
seems to understand the primary cause  1  now  i say that it cannot be
otherwise   that it is necessary and inevitable 

 1   the financial situation of the english government was shown up
in the house of lords during the session of january 23  it is not
an encouraging one  for several years the expenses have exceeded the
receipts  and the minister has been able to re establish the balance
only by loans renewed annually  the combined deficits of the years 1838
and 1839 amount to forty seven million five hundred thousand francs  in
1840  the excess of expenses over receipts is expected to be twenty two
million five hundred thousand francs  attention was called to these
figures by lord ripon  lord melbourne replied   the noble earl unhappily
was right in declaring that the public expenses continually increase 
and with him i must say that there is no room for hope that they can be
diminished or met in any way     national  january 26  1840 


a nation is the tenant of a rich proprietor called the government 
to whom it pays  for the use of the soil  a farm rent called a tax 
whenever the government makes war  loses or gains a battle  changes the
outfit of its army  erects a monu ment  digs a canal  opens a road 
or builds a railway  it borrows money  on which the tax payers pay
interest  that is  the government  without adding to its productive
capacity  increases its active capital   in a word  capitalizes after
the manner of the proprietor of whom i have just spoken 

now  when a governmental loan is once contracted  and the interest is
once stipulated  the budget cannot be reduced  for  to accomplish that 
either the capitalists must relinquish their interest  which would
involve an abandonment of property  or the government must go into
bankruptcy  which would be a fraudulent denial of the political
principle  or it must pay the debt  which would require another loan 
or it must reduce expenses  which is impossible  since the loan
was contracted for the sole reason that the ordinary receipts
were insufficient  or the money expended by the government must be
reproductive  which requires an increase of productive capacity   a
condition excluded by our hypothesis  or  finally  the tax payers must
submit to a new tax in order to pay the debt   an impossible thing  for 
if this new tax were levied upon all citizens alike  half  or even more 
of the citizens would be unable to pay it  if the rich had to bear the
whole  it would be a forced contribution   an invasion of property 
long financial experience has shown that the method of loans  though
exceedingly dangerous  is much surer  more convenient  and less costly
than any other method  consequently the government borrows   that is 
goes on capitalizing   and increases the budget 

then  a budget  instead of ever diminishing  must necessarily and
continually increase  it is astonishing that the economists  with all
their learning  have failed to perceive a fact so simple and so evident 
if they have perceived it  why have they neglected to condemn it 


historical comment   much interest is felt at present in a financial
operation which is expected to result in a reduction of the budget 
it is proposed to change the present rate of increase  five per cent 
laying aside the politico legal question to deal only with the financial
question   is it not true that  when five per cent  is changed to four
per cent   it will then be necessary  for the same reasons  to change
four to three  then three to two  then two to one  and finally to sweep
away increase altogether  but that would be the advent of equality of
conditions and the abolition of property  now it seems to me  that an
intelligent nation should voluntarily meet an inevitable revolution
half way  instead of suffering itself to be dragged after the car of
inflexible necessity 



eighth proposition 

property is impossible  because its power of accumulation is infinite 
and is exercised only over finite quantities 

if men  living in equality  should grant to one of their number the
exclusive right of property  and this sole proprietor should lend one
hundred francs to the human race at compound interest  payable to his
descendants twenty four generations hence   at the end of six hundred
years this sum of one hundred francs  at five per cent   would amount to
107 854 010 777 600 francs  two thousand six hundred and ninety six
and one third times the capital of france  supposing her capital to be
40 000 000 000   or more than twenty times the value of the terrestrial
globe 

suppose that a man  in the reign of st  louis  had borrowed one hundred
francs  and had refused   he and his heirs after him   to return it 
even though it were known that the said heirs were not the rightful
possessors  and that prescription had been interrupted always at the
right moment   nevertheless  by our laws  the last heir would be obliged
to return the one hundred francs with interest  and interest on the
interest  which in all would amount  as we have seen  to nearly one
hundred and eight thousand billions 

every day  fortunes are growing in our midst much more rapidly than
this  the preceding example supposed the interest equal to one twentieth
of the capital   it often equals one tenth  one fifth  one half of the
capital  and sometimes the capital itself 

the fourierists  irreconcilable enemies of equality  whose partisans
they regard as sharks  intend  by quadrupling production  to satisfy
all the demands of capital  labor  and skill  but  should production
be multiplied by four  ten  or even one hundred  property would
soon absorb  by its power of accumulation and the effects of its
capitalization  both products and capital  and the land  and even the
laborers  is the phalanstery to be prohibited from capitalizing and
lending at interest  let it explain  then  what it means by property 

i will carry these calculations no farther  they are capable of infinite
variation  upon which it would be puerile for me to insist  i only ask
by what standard judges  called upon to decide a suit for possession 
fix the interest  and  developing the question  i ask   

did the legislator  in introducing into the republic the principle
of property  weigh all the consequences  did he know the law of the
possible  if he knew it  why is it not in the code  why is so much
latitude allowed to the proprietor in accumulating property and
charging interest   to the judge in recognizing and fixing the domain of
property   to the state in its power to levy new taxes continually  at
what point is the nation justified in repudiating the budget  the tenant
his farm rent  and the manufacturer the interest on his capital  how
far may the idler take advantage of the laborer  where does the right
of spoliation begin  and where does it end  when may the producer say
to the proprietor   i owe you nothing more   when is property satisfied 
when must it cease to steal 

if the legislator did know the law of the possible  and disregarded it 
what must be thought of his justice  if he did not know it  what must
be thought of his wisdom  either wicked or foolish  how can we recognize
his authority 

if our charters and our codes are based upon an absurd hypothesis 
what is taught in the law schools  what does a judgment of the court
of appeal amount to  about what do our chambers deliberate  what is
politics  what is our definition of a statesman  what is the meaning of
jurisprudence  should we not rather say jurisignorance 

if all our institutions are based upon an error in calculation  does it
not follow that these institutions are so many shams  and if the entire
social structure is built upon this absolute impossibility of property 
is it not true that the government under which we live is a chimera  and
our present society a utopia 



ninth proposition 

property is impossible  because it is powerless against property 


i  by the third corollary of our axiom  interest tells against the
proprietor as well as the stranger  this economical principle is
universally admitted  nothing simpler at first blush  yet  nothing more
absurd  more contradictory in terms  or more absolutely impossible 

the manufacturer  it is said  pays himself the rent on his house and
capital  he pays himself  that is  he gets paid by the public who buy
his products  for  suppose the manufacturer  who seems to make this
profit on his property  wishes also to make it on his merchandise  can
he then pay himself one franc for that which cost him ninety centimes 
and make money by the operation  no  such a transaction would transfer
the merchant s money from his right hand to his left  but without any
profit whatever 

now  that which is true of a single individual trading with himself is
true also of the whole business world  form a chain of ten  fifteen 
twenty producers  as many as you wish  if the producer a makes a
profit out of the producer b  b s loss must  according to economical
principles  be made up by c  c s by d  and so on through to z 

but by whom will z be paid for the loss caused him by the profit charged
by a in the beginning  by the consumer  replies say  contemptible
equivocation  is this consumer any other  then  than a  b  c  d  &c  
or z  by whom will z be paid  if he is paid by a  no one makes a profit 
consequently  there is no property  if  on the contrary  z bears the
burden himself  he ceases to be a member of society  since it refuses
him the right of property and profit  which it grants to the other
associates 

since  then  a nation  like universal humanity  is a vast industrial
association which cannot act outside of itself  it is clear that no man
can enrich himself without impoverishing another  for  in order that the
right of property  the right of increase  may be respected in the
case of a  it must be denied to z  thus we see how equality of rights 
separated from equality of conditions  may be a truth  the iniquity of
political economy in this respect is flagrant   when i  a manufacturer 
purchase the labor of a workingman  i do not include his wages in the
net product of my business  on the contrary  i deduct them  but the
workingman includes them in his net product       say  political
economy  

that means that all which the workingman gains is net product  but that
only that part of the manufacturer s gains is net product  which remains
after deducting his wages  but why is the right of profit confined to
the manufacturer  why is this right  which is at bottom the right of
property itself  denied to the workingman  in the terms of economical
science  the workingman is capital  now  all capital  beyond the cost
of its maintenance and repair  must bear interest  this the proprietor
takes care to get  both for his capital and for himself  why is the
workingman prohibited from charging a like interest for his capital 
which is himself 

property  then  is inequality of rights  for  if it were not inequality
of rights  it would be equality of goods   in other words  it would not
exist  now  the charter guarantees to all equality of rights  then  by
the charter  property is impossible 

ii  is a  the proprietor of an estate  entitled by the fact of his
proprietorship to take possession of the field belonging to b  his
neighbor   no   reply the proprietors   but what has that to do with
the right of property   that i shall show you by a series of similar
propositions 

has c  a hatter  the right to force d  his neighbor and also a hatter 
to close his shop  and cease his business  not the least in the world 

but c wishes to make a profit of one franc on every hat  while d is
content with fifty centimes  it is evident that d s moderation is
injurious to c s extravagant claims  has the latter a right to prevent d
from selling  certainly not 

since d is at liberty to sell his hats fifty centimes cheaper than c if
he chooses  c in his turn is free to reduce his price one franc  now  d
is poor  while c is rich  so that at the end of two or three years d is
ruined by this intolerable competition  and c has complete control of
the market  can the proprietor d get any redress from the proprietor c 
can he bring a suit against him to recover his business and property 
no  for d could have done the same thing  had he been the richer of the
two 

on the same ground  the large proprietor a may say to the small
proprietor b   sell me your field  otherwise you shall not sell your
wheat    and that without doing him the least wrong  or giving him
ground for complaint  so that a can devour b if he likes  for the very
reason that a is stronger than b  consequently  it is not the right of
property which enables a and c to rob b and d  but the right of might 
by the right of property  neither the two neighbors a and b  nor the two
merchants c and d  could harm each other  they could neither dispossess
nor destroy one another  nor gain at one another s expense  the power of
invasion lies in superior strength 

but it is superior strength also which enables the manufacturer
to reduce the wages of his employees  and the rich merchant and
well stocked proprietor to sell their products for what they please  the
manufacturer says to the laborer   you are as free to go elsewhere
with your services as i am to receive them  i offer you so much   the
merchant says to the customer   take it or leave it  you are master of
your money  as i am of my goods  i want so much   who will yield  the
weaker 

therefore  without force  property is powerless against property  since
without force it has no power to increase  therefore  without force 
property is null and void 

historical comment   the struggle between colonial and native sugars
furnishes us a striking example of this impossibility of property  leave
these two industries to themselves  and the native manufacturer will
be ruined by the colonist  to maintain the beet root  the cane must be
taxed  to protect the property of the one  it is necessary to injure the
property of the other  the most remarkable feature of this business is
precisely that to which the least attention is paid  namely  that  in
one way or another  property has to be violated  impose on each industry
a proportional tax  so as to preserve a balance in the market  and you
create a maximum price   you attack property in two ways  on the one
hand  your tax interferes with the liberty of trade  on the other  it
does not recognize equality of proprietors  indemnify the beet root  you
violate the property of the tax payer  cultivate the two varieties of
sugar at the nation s expense  just as different varieties of tobacco
are cultivated   you abolish one species of property  this last course
would be the simpler and better one  but  to induce the nations to adopt
it  requires such a co operation of able minds and generous hearts as is
at present out of the question 

competition  sometimes called liberty of trade   in a word  property
in exchange   will be for a long time the basis of our commercial
legislation  which  from the economical point of view  embraces all
civil laws and all government  now  what is competition  a duel in a
closed field  where arms are the test of right 

 who is the liar   the accused or the accuser   said our barbarous
ancestors   let them fight it out   replied the still more barbarous
judge   the stronger is right  

which of us two shall sell spices to our neighbor   let each offer them
for sale   cries the economist   the sharper  or the more cunning  is
the more honest man  and the better merchant  

such is the exact spirit of the code napoleon 



tenth proposition 

property is impossible  because it is the negation of equality 


the development of this proposition will be the resume of the preceding
ones 

1  it is a principle of economical justice  that products are bought
only by products  property  being capable of defence only on the ground
that it produces utility  is  since it produces nothing  for ever
condemned 

2  it is an economical law  that labor must be balanced by product  it
is a fact that  with property  production costs more than it is worth 

3  another economical law  the capital being given  production is
measured  not by the amount of capital  but by productive capacity 
property  requiring income to be always proportional to capital without
regard to labor  does not recognize this relation of equality between
effect and cause 

4 and 5  like the insect which spins its silk  the laborer never
produces for himself alone  property  demanding a double product and
unable to obtain it  robs the laborer  and kills him 

6  nature has given to every man but one mind  one heart  one will 
property  granting to one individual a plurality of votes  supposes him
to have a plurality of minds 

7  all consumption which is not reproductive of utility is destruction 
property  whether it consumes or hoards or capitalizes  is productive of
inutility   the cause of sterility and death 

8  the satisfaction of a natural right always gives rise to an equation 
in other words  the right to a thing is necessarily balanced by the
possession of the thing  thus  between the right to liberty and the
condition of a free man there is a balance  an equation  between the
right to be a father and paternity  an equation  between the right to
security and the social guarantee  an equation  but between the right
of increase and the receipt of this increase there is never an equation 
for every new increase carries with it the right to another  the latter
to a third  and so on for ever  property  never being able to accomplish
its object  is a right against nature and against reason 

9  finally  property is not self existent  an extraneous cause  either
force or fraud  is necessary to its life and action  in other
words  property is not equal to property  it is a negation  a
delusion  nothing 




chapter v  psychological exposition of the idea of justice


     psychological exposition of the idea of justice and
     injustice  and a determination of the principle of
     government and of right 


property is impossible  equality does not exist  we hate the former  and
yet wish to possess it  the latter rules all our thoughts  yet we know
not how to reach it  who will explain this profound antagonism between
our conscience and our will  who will point out the causes of this
pernicious error  which has become the most sacred principle of justice
and society 

i am bold enough to undertake the task  and i hope to succeed 

but before explaining why man has violated justice  it is necessary to
determine what justice is 



part first 


  1   of the moral sense in man and the animals 


the philosophers have endeavored often to locate the line which
separates man s intelligence from that of the brutes  and  according
to their general custom  they gave utterance to much foolishness before
resolving upon the only course possible for them to take   observation 
it was reserved for an unpretending savant  who perhaps did not pride
himself on his philosophy  to put an end to the interminable controversy
by a simple distinction  but one of those luminous distinctions which
are worth more than systems  frederic cuvier separated instinct from
intelligence 

but  as yet  no one has proposed this question   

is the difference between man s moral sense and that of the brute a
difference in kind or only in degree 

if  hitherto  any one had dared to maintain the latter alternative  his
arguments would have seemed scandalous  blasphemous  and offensive to
morality and religion  the ecclesiastical and secular tribunals would
have condemned him with one voice  and  mark the style in which they
would have branded the immoral paradox   conscience    they would have
cried    conscience  man s chief glory  was given to him exclusively 
the notion of justice and injustice  of merit and demerit  is his noble
privilege  to man  alone   the lord of creation   belongs the sublime
power to resist his worldly propensities  to choose between good and
evil  and to bring himself more and more into the resemblance of god
through liberty and justice     no  the holy image of virtue was never
graven save on the heart of man   words full of feeling  but void of
sense 

man is a rational and social animal   greek   c g   said aristotle  this
definition is worth more than all which have been given since  i do not
except even m  de bonald s celebrated definition   man is an intellect
served by organs  a definition which has the double fault of explaining
the known by the unknown  that is  the living being by the intellect 
and of neglecting man s essential quality   animality 

man  then  is an animal living in society  society means the sum total
of relationships  in short  system  now  all systems exist only on
certain conditions  what  then  are the conditions  the laws  of human
society 

what are the rights of men with respect to each other  what is justice 

it amounts to nothing to say   with the philosophers of various
schools    it is a divine instinct  an immortal and heavenly voice  a
guide given us by nature  a light revealed unto every man on coming
into the world  a law engraved upon our hearts  it is the voice of
conscience  the dictum of reason  the inspiration of sentiment  the
penchant of feeling  it is the love of self in others  it is enlightened
self interest  or else it is an innate idea  the imperative command of
applied reason  which has its source in the concepts of pure reason 
it is a passional attraction   &c   &c  this may be as true as it seems
beautiful  but it is utterly meaningless  though we should prolong
this litany through ten pages  it has been filtered through a thousand
volumes   we should be no nearer to the solution of the question 

 justice is public utility   says aristotle  that is true  but it is a
tautology   the principle that the public welfare ought to be the
object of the legislator   says m  ch  comte in his  treatise on
legislation    cannot be overthrown  but legislation is advanced no
farther by its announcement and demonstration  than is medicine when it
is said that it is the business of physicians to cure the sick  

let us take another course  rught is the sum total of the principles
which govern society  justice  in man  is the respect and observation of
those principles  to practise justice is to obey the social instinct 
to do an act of justice is to do a social act  if  then  we watch the
conduct of men towards each other under different circumstances  it
will be easy for us to distinguish between the presence and absence of
society  from the result we may inductively infer the law 

let us commence with the simplest and least doubtful cases 

the mother  who protects her son at the peril of her life  and
sacrifices every thing to his support  is in society with him  she is a
good mother  she  on the contrary  who abandons her child  is unfaithful
to the social instinct   maternal love being one of its many features 
she is an unnatural mother 

if i plunge into the water to rescue a drowning man  i am his brother 
his associate  if  instead of aiding him  i sink him  i am his enemy 
his murderer 

whoever bestows alms treats the poor man as his associate  not
thoroughly  it is true  but only in respect to the amount which he
shares with him  whoever takes by force or stratagem that which is
not the product of his labor  destroys his social character  he is a
brigand 

the samaritan who relieves the traveller lying by the wayside  dresses
his wounds  comforts him  and supplies him with money  thereby declares
himself his associate  his neighbor  the priest  who passes by on the
other side  remains unassociated  and is his enemy 

in all these cases  man is moved by an internal attraction towards his
fellow  by a secret sympathy which causes him to love  congratulate 
and condole  so that  to resist this attraction  his will must struggle
against his nature 

but in these respects there is no decided difference between man and the
animals  with them  as long as the weakness of their young endears them
to their mothers   in a word  associates them with their mothers   the
latter protect the former  at the peril of their lives  with a courage
which reminds us of our heroes dying for their country  certain species
unite for hunting purposes  seek each other  call each other  a poet
would say invite each other   to share their prey  in danger they
aid  protect  and warn each other  the elephant knows how to help his
companion out of the ditch into which the latter has fallen  cows form
a circle  with their horns outward and their calves in the centre  in
order to repel the attacks of wolves  horses and pigs  on hearing a cry
of distress from one of their number  rush to the spot whence it comes 
what descriptions i might give of their marriages  the tenderness of the
males towards the females  and the fidelity of their loves  let us add 
however   to be entirely just  that these touching demonstrations of
society  fraternity  and love of neighbor  do not prevent the animals
from quarrelling  fighting  and outrageously abusing one another while
gaining their livelihood and showing their gallantry  the resemblance
between them and ourselves is perfect 

the social instinct  in man and beast  exists to a greater or less
degree  its nature is the same  man has the greater need of association 
and employs it more  the animal seems better able to endure isolation 
in man  social needs are more imperative and complex  in the beast  they
seem less intense  less diversified  less regretted  society  in a
word  aims  in the case of man  at the preservation of the race and
the individual  with the animals  its object is more exclusively the
preservation of the race 

as yet  we have met with no claim which man can make for himself alone 
the social instinct and the moral sense he shares with the brutes  and
when he thinks to become god like by a few acts of charity  justice 
and devotion  he does not perceive that in so acting he simply obeys an
instinct wholly animal in its nature  as we are good  loving  tender 
just  so we are passionate  greedy  lewd  and vindictive  that is  we
are like the beasts  our highest virtues appear  in the last analysis 
as blind  impulsive instincts  what subjects for canonization and
apotheosis 

there is  however  a difference between us two handed bipeds and other
living creatures  what is it 

a student of philosophy would hasten to reply   this difference lies in
the fact that we are conscious of our social faculty  while the animals
are unconscious of theirs  in the fact that while we reflect and reason
upon the operation of our social instinct  the animals do nothing of the
kind  

i will go farther  it is by our reflective and reasoning powers 
with which we seem to be exclusively endowed  that we know that it is
injurious  first to others and then to ourselves  to resist the social
instinct which governs us  and which we call justice  it is our reason
which teaches us that the selfish man  the robber  the murderer  in a
word  the traitor to society  sins against nature  and is guilty with
respect to others and himself  when he does wrong wilfully  finally  it
is our social sentiment on the one hand  and our reason on the
other  which cause us to think that beings such as we should take the
responsibility of their acts  such is the principle of remorse  revenge 
and penal justice 

but this proves only an intellectual diversity between the animals and
man  not at all an affectional one  for  although we reason upon our
relations with our fellows  we likewise reason upon our most trivial
actions   such as drinking  eating  choosing a wife  or selecting a
dwelling place  we reason upon things earthly and things heavenly  there
is nothing to which our reasoning powers are not applicable  now 
just as the knowledge of external phenomena  which we acquire  has no
influence upon their causes and laws  so reflection  by illuminating our
instinct  enlightens us as to our sentient nature  but does not alter
its character  it tells us what our morality is  but neither changes nor
modifies it  our dissatisfaction with ourselves after doing wrong 
the indignation which we feel at the sight of injustice  the idea of
deserved punishment and due remuneration  are effects of reflection  and
not immediate effects of instinct and emotion  our appreciation  i do
not say exclusive appreciation  for the animals also realize that they
have done wrong  and are indignant when one of their number is attacked 
but   our infinitely superior appreciation of our social duties  our
knowledge of good and evil  does not establish  as regards morality  any
vital difference between man and the beasts 



  2   of the first and second degrees of sociability 


i insist upon the fact  which i have just pointed out  as one of the
most important facts of anthropology 

the sympathetic attraction  which causes us to associate  is  by reason
of its blind  unruly nature  always governed by temporary impulse 
without regard to higher rights  and without distinction of merit or
priority  the bastard dog follows indifferently all who call it  the
suckling child regards every man as its father and every woman as its
nurse  every living creature  when deprived of the society of animals
of its species  seeks companionship in its solitude  this fundamental
characteristic of the social instinct renders intolerable and even
hateful the friendship of frivolous persons  liable to be infatuated
with every new face  accommodating to all whether good or bad  and
ready to sacrifice  for a passing liaison  the oldest and most honorable
affections  the fault of such beings is not in the heart  it is in the
judgment  sociability  in this degree  is a sort of magnetism awakened
in us by the contemplation of a being similar to ourselves  but which
never goes beyond the person who feels it  it may be reciprocated  but
not communicated  love  benevolence  pity  sympathy  call it what you
will  there is nothing in it which deserves esteem   nothing which lifts
man above the beast 

the second degree of sociability is justice  which may be defined as the
recognition of the equality between another s personality and our own 
the sentiment of justice we share with the animals  we alone can form
an exact idea of it  but our idea  as has been said already  does not
change its nature  we shall soon see how man rises to a third degree
of sociability which the animals are incapable of reaching  but i must
first prove by metaphysics that society  justice  and equality 
are three equivalent terms   three expressions meaning the same
thing   whose mutual conversion is always allowable 

if  amid the confusion of a shipwreck  having escaped in a boat with
some provisions  i see a man struggling with the waves  am i bound to
go to his assistance  yes  i am bound under penalty of being adjudged
guilty of murder and treason against society 

but am i also bound to share with him my provisions 

to settle this question  we must change the phraseology  if society is
binding on the boat  is it also binding on the provisions  undoubtedly 
the duty of an associate is absolute  man s occupancy succeeds his
social nature  and is subordinate to it  possession can become exclusive
only when permission to occupy is granted to all alike  that which
in this instance obscures our duty is our power of foresight  which 
causing us to fear an eventual danger  impels us to usurpation  and
makes us robbers and murderers  animals do not calculate the duty of
instinct any more than the disadvantages resulting to those who exercise
it  it would be strange if the intellect of man  the most sociable of
animals  should lead him to disobey the law 

he betrays society who attempts to use it only for his own advantage 
better that god should deprive us of prudence  if it is to serve as the
tool of our selfishness 

 what   you will say   must i share my bread  the bread which i have
earned and which belongs to me  with the stranger whom i do not know 
whom i may never see again  and who  perhaps  will reward me with
ingratitude  if we had earned this bread together  if this man had
done something to obtain it  he might demand his share  since his
co operation would entitle him to it  but as it is  what claim has he on
me  we have not produced together  we shall not eat together  

the fallacy in this argument lies in the false supposition  that each
producer is not necessarily associated with every other producer 

when two or more individuals have regularly organized a society   when
the contracts have been agreed upon  drafted  and signed   there is
no difficulty about the future  everybody knows that when two men
associate  for instance  in order to fish  if one of them catches no
fish  he is none the less entitled to those caught by his associate 
if two merchants form a partnership  while the partnership lasts  the
profits and losses are divided between them  since each produces  not
for himself  but for the society  when the time of distribution arrives 
it is not the producer who is considered  but the associate  that is why
the slave  to whom the planter gives straw and rice  and the civilized
laborer  to whom the capitalist pays a salary which is always too
small   not being associated with their employers  although producing
with them   are disregarded when the product is divided  thus  the horse
who draws our coaches  and the ox who draws our carts produce with us 
but are not associated with us  we take their product  but do not share
it with them  the animals and laborers whom we employ hold the same
relation to us  whatever we do for them  we do  not from a sense of
justice  but out of pure benevolence   22 


but is it possible that we are not all associated  let us call to mind
what was said in the last two chapters  that even though we do not want
to be associated  the force of things  the necessity of consumption  the
laws of production  and the mathematical principle of exchange combine
to associate us  there is but a single exception to this rule   that
of the proprietor  who  producing by his right of increase  is not
associated with any one  and consequently is not obliged to share his
product with any one  just as no one else is bound to share with him 
with the exception of the proprietor  we labor for each other  we can
do nothing by ourselves unaided by others  and we continually exchange
products and services with each other  if these are not social acts 
what are they 

now  neither a commercial  nor an industrial  nor an agricultural
association can be conceived of in the absence of equality  equality
is its sine qua non  so that  in all matters which concern this
association  to violate society is to violate justice and equality 
apply this principle to humanity at large 

after what has been said  i assume that the reader has sufficient
insight to enable him to dispense with any aid of mine 

by this principle  the man who takes possession of a field  and says 
 this field is mine   will not be unjust so long as every one else has
an equal right of possession  nor will he be unjust  if  wishing to
change his location  he exchanges this field for an equivalent  but
if  putting another in his place  he says to him   work for me while
i rest   he then becomes unjust  unassociated  unequal  he is a
proprietor 

reciprocally  the sluggard  or the rake  who  without performing
any social task  enjoys like others  and often more than others  the
products of society  should be proceeded against as a thief and a
parasite  we owe it to ourselves to give him nothing  but  since he must
live  to put him under supervision  and compel him to labor 

sociability is the attraction felt by sentient beings for each other 
justice is this same attraction  accompanied by thought and knowledge 
but under what general concept  in what category of the understanding 
is justice placed  in the category of equal quantities  hence  the
ancient definition of justice   justum aequale est  injustum inaequale  
what is it  then  to practise justice  it is to give equal wealth
to each  on condition of equal labor  it is to act socially  our
selfishness may complain  there is no escape from evidence and
necessity 

what is the right of occupancy  it is a natural method of dividing the
earth  by reducing each laborer s share as fast as new laborers present
themselves  this right disappears if the public interest requires it 
which  being the social interest  is also that of the occupant 

what is the right of labor  it is the right to obtain one s share
of wealth by fulfilling the required conditions  it is the right of
society  the right of equality 

justice  which is the product of the combination of an idea and an
instinct  manifests itself in man as soon as he is capable of feeling 
and of forming ideas  consequently  it has been regarded as an
innate and original sentiment  but this opinion is logically and
chronologically false  but justice  by its composition hybrid  if i may
use the term   justice  born of emotion and intellect combined  seems to
me one of the strongest proofs of the unity and simplicity of the
ego  the organism being no more capable of producing such a mixture by
itself  than are the combined senses of hearing and sight of forming a
binary sense  half auditory and half visual 

this double nature of justice gives us the definitive basis of all the
demonstrations in chapters ii   iii   and iv  on the one hand  the idea
of justice being identical with that of society  and society necessarily
implying equality  equality must underlie all the sophisms invented in
defence of property  for  since property can be defended only as a just
and social institution  and property being inequality  in order to
prove that property is in harmony with society  it must be shown that
injustice is justice  and that inequality is equality   a contradiction
in terms  on the other hand  since the idea of equality  the second
element of justice  has its source in the mathematical proportions of
things  and since property  or the unequal distribution of wealth among
laborers  destroys the necessary balance between labor  production  and
consumption   property must be impossible 

all men  then  are associated  all are entitled to the same justice  all
are equal  does it follow that the preferences of love and friendship
are unjust 

this requires explanation  i have already supposed the case of a man in
peril  i being in a position to help him  now  i suppose myself appealed
to at the same time by two men exposed to danger 

am i not allowed  am i not commanded even  to rush first to the aid of
him who is endeared to me by ties of blood  friendship  acquaintance 
or esteem  at the risk of leaving the other to perish  yes  and why 
because within universal society there exist for each of us as many
special societies as there are individuals  and we are bound  by the
principle of sociability itself  to fulfil the obligations which these
impose upon us  according to the intimacy of our relations with them 
therefore we must give our father  mother  children  friends  relatives 
&c   the preference over all others  but in what consists this
preference 

a judge has a case to decide  in which one of the parties is his
friend  and the other his enemy  should he  in this instance  prefer
his intimate associate to his distant associate  and decide the case in
favor of his friend  in spite of evidence to the contrary  no  for  if
he should favor his friend s injustice  he would become his accomplice
in his violation of the social compact  he would form with him a sort of
conspiracy against the social body  preference should be shown only in
personal matters  such as love  esteem  confidence  or intimacy  when
all cannot be considered at once  thus  in case of fire  a father
would save his own child before thinking of his neighbor s  but the
recognition of a right not being an optional matter with a judge  he is
not at liberty to favor one person to the detriment of another 

the theory of these special societies  which are formed concentrically 
so to speak  by each of us inside of the main body  gives the key to
all the problems which arise from the opposition and conflict of the
different varieties of social duty   problems upon which the ancient
tragedies are based 

the justice practised among animals is  in a certain degree  negative 
with the exception of protecting their young  hunting and plundering
in troops  uniting for common defence and sometimes for individual
assistance  it consists more in prevention than in action  a sick animal
who cannot arise from the ground  or an imprudent one who has fallen
over a precipice  receives neither medicine nor nourishment  if he
cannot cure himself  nor relieve himself of his trouble  his life is in
danger  he will neither be cared for in bed  nor fed in a prison 

their neglect of their fellows arises as much from the weakness of
their intellect as from their lack of resources  still  the degrees
of intimacy common among men are not unknown to the animals  they
have friendships of habit and of choice  friendships neighborly  and
friendships parental  in comparison with us  they have feeble memories 
sluggish feelings  and are almost destitute of intelligence  but
the identity of these faculties is preserved to some extent  and our
superiority in this respect arises entirely from our understanding 

it is our strength of memory and penetration of judgment which enable us
to multiply and combine the acts which our social instinct impels us to
perform  and which teaches us how to render them more effective  and
how to distribute them justly  the beasts who live in society practise
justice  but are ignorant of its nature  and do not reason upon it  they
obey their instinct without thought or philosophy  they know not how to
unite the social sentiment with the idea of equality  which they do not
possess  this idea being an abstract one  we  on the contrary  starting
with the principle that society implies equality  can  by our reasoning
faculty  understand and agree with each other in settling our rights 
we have even used our judgment to a great extent  but in all this our
conscience plays a small part  as is proved by the fact that the idea
of right  of which we catch a glimpse in certain animals who approach
nearer than any others to our standard of intelligence  seems to grow 
from the low level at which it stands in savages  to the lofty height
which it reaches in a plato or a franklin  if we trace the development
of the moral sense in individuals  and the progress of laws in nations 
we shall be convinced that the ideas of justice and legislative
perfection are always proportional to intelligence  the notion of
justice  which has been regarded by some philosophers as simple  is
then  in reality  complex  it springs from the social instinct on the
one hand  and the idea of equality on the other  just as the notion of
guilt arises from the feeling that justice has been violated  and from
the idea of free will 

in conclusion  instinct is not modified by acquaintance with its nature 
and the facts of society  which we have thus far observed  occur among
beasts as well as men  we know the meaning of justice  in other words 
of sociability viewed from the standpoint of equality  we have met with
nothing which separates us from the animals 



  3   of the third degree of sociability 


the reader  perhaps  has not forgotten what was said in the third
chapter concerning the division of labor and the speciality of talents 
the sum total of the talents and capacities of the race is always
the same  and their nature is always similar  we are all born poets 
mathematicians  philosophers  artists  artisans  or farmers  but we are
not born equally endowed  and between one man and another in society 
or between one faculty and another in the same individual  there is an
infinite difference  this difference of degree in the same faculties 
this predominance of talent in certain directions  is  we have said 
the very foundation of our society  intelligence and natural genius have
been distributed by nature so economically  and yet so liberally  that
in society there is no danger of either a surplus or a scarcity of
special talents  and that each laborer  by devoting himself to his
function  may always attain to the degree of proficiency necessary to
enable him to benefit by the labors and discoveries of his fellows 
owing to this simple and wise precaution of nature  the laborer is not
isolated by his task  he communicates with his fellows through the mind 
before he is united with them in heart  so that with him love is born of
intelligence 

it is not so with societies of animals  in every species  the aptitudes
of all the individuals  though very limited  are equal in number and
 when they are not the result of instinct  in intensity  each one does
as well as all the others what all the others do  provides his food 
avoids the enemy  burrows in the earth  builds a nest  &c  no animal 
when free and healthy  expects or requires the aid of his neighbor  who 
in his turn  is equally independent 

associated animals live side by side without any intellectual
intercourse or intimate communication   all doing the same things 
having nothing to learn or to remember  they see  feel  and come in
contact with each other  but never penetrate each other  man continually
exchanges with man ideas and feelings  products and services  every
discovery and act in society is necessary to him  but of this immense
quantity of products and ideas  that which each one has to produce and
acquire for himself is but an atom in the sun  man would not be man were
it not for society  and society is supported by the balance and harmony
of the powers which compose it 

society  among the animals  is simple  with man it is complex  man is
associated with man by the same instinct which associates animal with
animal  but man is associated differently from the animal  and it is
this difference in association which constitutes the difference in
morality 

i have proved   at too great length  perhaps   both by the spirit of
the laws which regard property as the basis of society  and by political
economy  that inequality of conditions is justified neither by priority
of occupation nor superiority of talent  service  industry  and
capacity  but  although equality of conditions is a necessary
consequence of natural right  of liberty  of the laws of production 
of the capacity of physical nature  and of the principle of society
itself   it does not prevent the social sentiment from stepping over the
boundaries of debt and credit  the fields of benevolence and love extend
far beyond  and when economy has adjusted its balance  the mind
begins to benefit by its own justice  and the heart expands in the
boundlessness of its affection 

the social sentiment then takes on a new character  which varies with
different persons  in the strong  it becomes the pleasure of generosity 
among equals  frank and cordial friendship  in the weak  the pleasure of
admiration and gratitude 

the man who is superior in strength  skill  or courage  knows that he
owes all that he is to society  without which he could not exist  he
knows that  in treating him precisely as it does the lowest of its
members  society discharges its whole duty towards him  but he does
not underrate his faculties  he is no less conscious of his power and
greatness  and it is this voluntary reverence which he pays to humanity 
this avowal that he is but an instrument of nature   who is alone worthy
of glory and worship   it is  i say  this simultaneous confession of
the heart and the mind  this genuine adoration of the great being  that
distinguishes and elevates man  and lifts him to a degree of social
morality to which the beast is powerless to attain  hercules destroying
the monsters and punishing brigands for the safety of greece  orpheus
teaching the rough and wild pelasgians   neither of them putting a price
upon their services   there we see the noblest creations of poetry  the
loftiest expression of justice and virtue 

the joys of self sacrifice are ineffable 

if i were to compare human society to the old greek tragedies  i should
say that the phalanx of noble minds and lofty souls dances the strophe 
and the humble multitude the antistrophe  burdened with painful and
disagreeable tasks  but rendered omnipotent by their number and the
harmonic arrangement of their functions  the latter execute what the
others plan  guided by them  they owe them nothing  they honor them 
however  and lavish upon them praise and approbation 

gratitude fills people with adoration and enthusiasm 

but equality delights my heart  benevolence degenerates into tyranny 
and admiration into servility  friendship is the daughter of equality 
o my friends  may i live in your midst without emulation  and without
glory  let equality bring us together  and fate assign us our places 
may i die without knowing to whom among you i owe the most esteem 

friendship is precious to the hearts of the children of men 

generosity  gratitude  i mean here only that gratitude which is born
of admiration of a superior power   and friendship are three distinct
shades of a single sentiment which i will call equite  or social
proportionality   23  equite does not change justice  but  always taking
equite for the base  it superadds esteem  and thereby forms in man a
third degree of sociability  equite makes it at once our duty and our
pleasure to aid the weak who have need of us  and to make them our
equals  to pay to the strong a just tribute of gratitude and honor 
without enslaving ourselves to them  to cherish our neighbors  friends 
and equals  for that which we receive from them  even by right of
exchange  equite is sociability raised to its ideal by reason and
justice  its commonest manifestation is urbanity or politeness  which 
among certain nations  sums up in a single word nearly all the social
duties 

it is the just distribution of social sympathy and universal love 

now  this feeling is unknown among the beasts  who love and cling to
each other  and show their preferences  but who cannot conceive of
esteem  and who are incapable of generosity  admiration  or politeness 

this feeling does not spring from intelligence  which calculates 
computes  and balances  but does not love  which sees  but does not
feel  as justice is the product of social instinct and reflection
combined  so equite is a product of justice and taste combined  that is 
of our powers of judging and of idealizing 

this product  the third and last degree of human sociability  is
determined by our complex mode of association  in which inequality 
or rather the divergence of faculties  and the speciality of
functions  tending of themselves to isolate laborers  demand a more
active sociability 

that is why the force which oppresses while protecting is execrable  why
the silly ignorance which views with the same eye the marvels of art 
and the products of the rudest industry  excites unutterable contempt 
why proud mediocrity  which glories in saying   i have paid you  i owe
you nothing   is especially odious 

sociability  justice  equite  such  in its triplicity  is the exact
definition of the instinctive faculty which leads us into communication
with our fellows  and whose physical manifestation is expressed by the
formula  equality in natural wealth  and the products of labor 

these three degrees of sociability support and imply each other 

equite cannot exist without justice  society without justice is a
solecism  if  in order to reward talent  i take from one to give to
another  in unjustly stripping the first  i do not esteem his talent as
i ought  if  in society  i award more to myself than to my associate  we
are not really associated  justice is sociability as manifested in the
division of material things  susceptible of weight and measure  equite
is justice accompanied by admiration and esteem   things which cannot be
measured 

from this several inferences may be drawn 

1  though we are free to grant our esteem to one more than to another 
and in all possible degrees  yet we should give no one more than his
proportion of the common wealth  because the duty of justice  being
imposed upon us before that of equite  must always take precedence of
it  the woman honored by the ancients  who  when forced by a tyrant
to choose between the death of her brother and that of her husband 
sacrificed the latter on the ground that she could find another husband
but not another brother   that woman  i say  in obeying her sense of
equite  failed in point of justice  and did a bad deed  because conjugal
association is a closer relation than fraternal association  and because
the life of our neighbor is not our property 

by the same principle  inequality of wages cannot be admitted by law on
the ground of inequality of talents  because the just distribution of
wealth is the function of economy   not of enthusiasm 

finally  as regards donations  wills  and inheritance  society  careful
both of the personal affections and its own rights  must never permit
love and partiality to destroy justice  and  though it is pleasant to
think that the son  who has been long associated with his father in
business  is more capable than any one else of carrying it on  and that
the citizen  who is surprised in the midst of his task by death  is
best fitted  in consequence of his natural taste for his occupation  to
designate his successor  and though the heir should be allowed the right
of choice in case of more than one inheritance   nevertheless  society
can tolerate no concentration of capital and industry for the benefit of
a single man  no monopoly of labor  no encroachment   24 

 suppose that some spoils  taken from the enemy  and equal to twelve 
are to be divided between achilles and ajax  if the two persons were
equal  their respective shares would be arithmetically equal  achilles
would have six  ajax six  and if we should carry out this arithmetical
equality  thersites would be entitled to as much as achilles  which
would be unjust in the extreme  to avoid this injustice  the worth of
the persons should be estimated  and the spoils divided accordingly 
suppose that the worth of achilles is double that of ajax  the former s
share is eight  the latter four  there is no arithmetical equality  but
a proportional equality  it is this comparison of merits  rationum 
that aristotle calls distributive justice  it is a geometrical
proportion    toullier  french law according to the code 

are achilles and ajax associated  or are they not  settle that  and
you settle the whole question  if achilles and ajax  instead of being
associated  are themselves in the service of agamemnon who pays them 
there is no objection to aristotle s method  the slave owner  who
controls his slaves  may give a double allowance of brandy to him who
does double work  that is the law of despotism  the right of slavery 

but if achilles and ajax are associated  they are equals  what matters
it that achilles has a strength of four  while that of ajax is only two 
the latter may always answer that he is free  that if achilles has a
strength of four  five could kill him  finally  that in doing personal
service he incurs as great a risk as achilles  the same argument applies
to thersites  if he is unable to fight  let him be cook  purveyor  or
butler  if he is good for nothing  put him in the hospital  in no case
wrong him  or impose upon him laws 

man must live in one of two states  either in society  or out of it 
in society  conditions are necessarily equal  except in the degree of
esteem and consideration which each one may receive  out of society  man
is so much raw material  a capitalized tool  and often an incommodious
and useless piece of furniture 


2  equite  justice  and society  can exist only between individuals of
the same species  they form no part of the relations of different races
to each other   for instance  of the wolf to the goat  of the goat to
man  of man to god  much less of god to man  the attribution of justice 
equity  and love to the supreme being is pure anthropomorphism  and the
adjectives just  merciful  pitiful  and the like  should be stricken
from our litanies  god can be regarded as just  equitable  and good 
only to another god  now  god has no associate  consequently  he cannot
experience social affections   such as goodness  equite  and justice 
is the shepherd said to be just to his sheep and his dogs  no  and if he
saw fit to shear as much wool from a lamb six months old  as from a ram
of two years  or  if he required as much work from a young dog as from
an old one   they would say  not that he was unjust  but that he was
foolish  between man and beast there is no society  though there may be
affection  man loves the animals as things   as sentient things  if you
will   but not as persons  philosophy  after having eliminated from the
idea of god the passions ascribed to him by superstition  will then be
obliged to eliminate also the virtues which our liberal piety awards to
him   25 

the rights of woman and her relations with man are yet to be determined
matrimonial legislation  like civil legislation  is a matter for the
future to settle 

if god should come down to earth  and dwell among us  we could not love
him unless he became like us  nor give him any thing unless he produced
something  nor listen to him unless he proved us mistaken  nor worship
him unless he manifested his power  all the laws of our nature 
affectional  economical  and intellectual  would prevent us from
treating him as we treat our fellow men   that is  according to reason 
justice  and equite 

i infer from this that  if god should wish ever to put himself into
immediate communication with man  he would have to become a man 

now  if kings are images of god  and executors of his will  they cannot
receive love  wealth  obedience  and glory from us  unless they consent
to labor and associate with us  produce as much as they consume  reason
with their subjects  and do wonderful things  still more  if  as some
pretend  kings are public functionaries  the love which is due them is
measured by their personal amiability  our obligation to obey them  by
the wisdom of their commands  and their civil list  by the total social
production divided by the number of citizens 

thus  jurisprudence  political economy  and psychology agree in
admitting the law of equality  right and duty  the due reward of talent
and labor  the outbursts of love and enthusiasm   all are regulated in
advance by an invariable standard  all depend upon number and balance 
equality of conditions is the law of society  and universal solidarity
is the ratification of this law 

equality of conditions has never been realized  thanks to our passions
and our ignorance  but our opposition to this law has made it all the
more a necessity  to that fact history bears perpetual testimony  and
the course of events reveals it to us  society advances from equation to
equation  to the eyes of the economist  the revolutions of empires
seem now like the reduction of algebraical quantities  which are
inter deducible  now like the discovery of unknown quantities  induced
by the inevitable influence of time  figures are the providence of
history  undoubtedly there are other elements in human progress  but in
the multitude of hidden causes which agitate nations  there is none more
powerful or constant  none less obscure  than the periodical explosions
of the proletariat against property  property  acting by exclusion
and encroachment  while population was increasing  has been the
life principle and definitive cause of all revolutions  religious wars 
and wars of conquest  when they have stopped short of the extermination
of races  have been only accidental disturbances  soon repaired by the
mathematical progression of the life of nations  the downfall and death
of societies are due to the power of accumulation possessed by property 

in the middle ages  take florence   a republic of merchants and brokers 
always rent by its well known factions  the guelphs and ghibellines  who
were  after all  only the people and the proprietors fighting against
each other   florence  ruled by bankers  and borne down at last by the
weight of her debts   26  in ancient times  take rome  preyed upon from
its birth by usury  flourishing  nevertheless  as long as the known
world furnished its terrible proletaires with labor stained with blood
by civil war at every interval of rest  and dying of exhaustion when
the people lost  together with their former energy  their last spark
of moral sense  carthage  a commercial and financial city  continually
divided by internal competition  tyre  sidon  jerusalem  nineveh 
babylon  ruined  in turn  by commercial rivalry and  as we now express
it  by panics in the market   do not these famous examples show clearly
enough the fate which awaits modern nations  unless the people 
unless france  with a sudden burst of her powerful voice  proclaims in
thunder tones the abolition of the regime of property 


here my task should end  i have proved the right of the poor  i have
shown the usurpation of the rich  i demand justice  it is not my
business to execute the sentence  if it should be argued  in order to
prolong for a few years an illegitimate privilege  that it is not enough
to demonstrate equality  that it is necessary also to organize it  and
above all to establish it peacefully  i might reply  the welfare of the
oppressed is of more importance than official composure  equality of
conditions is a natural law upon which public economy and jurisprudence
are based  the right to labor  and the principle of equal distribution
of wealth  cannot give way to the anxieties of power  it is not for the
proletaire to reconcile the contradictions of the codes  still less to
suffer for the errors of the government  on the contrary  it is the duty
of the civil and administrative power to reconstruct itself on the basis
of political equality  an evil  when known  should be condemned and
destroyed  the legislator cannot plead ignorance as an excuse for
upholding a glaring iniquity  restitution should not be delayed 
justice  justice  recognition of right  reinstatement of the
proletaire   when these results are accomplished  then  judges and
consuls  you may attend to your police  and provide a government for the
republic 

for the rest  i do not think that a single one of my readers accuses
me of knowing how to destroy  but of not knowing how to construct  in
demonstrating the principle of equality  i have laid the foundation of
the social structure i have done more  i have given an example of
the true method of solving political and legislative problems  of the
science itself  i confess that i know nothing more than its principle 
and i know of no one at present who can boast of having penetrated
deeper  many people cry   come to me  and i will teach you the truth  
these people mistake for the truth their cherished opinion and ardent
conviction  which is usually any thing but the truth  the science of
society  like all human sciences  will be for ever incomplete  the depth
and variety of the questions which it embraces are infinite  we hardly
know the a b c of this science  as is proved by the fact that we have
not yet emerged from the period of systems  and have not ceased to
put the authority of the majority in the place of facts  a certain
philological society decided linguistic questions by a plurality
of votes  our parliamentary debates  were their results less
pernicious  would be even more ridiculous  the task of the true
publicist  in the age in which we live  is to close the mouths of
quacks and charlatans  and to teach the public to demand demonstrations 
instead of being contented with symbols and programmes  before talking
of the science itself  it is necessary to ascertain its object  and
discover its method and principle  the ground must be cleared of the
prejudices which encumber it  such is the mission of the nineteenth
century 

for my part  i have sworn fidelity to my work of demolition  and i will
not cease to pursue the truth through the ruins and rubbish  i hate to
see a thing half done  and it will be believed without any assurance of
mine  that  having dared to raise my hand against the holy ark  i shall
not rest contented with the removal of the cover  the mysteries of the
sanctuary of iniquity must be unveiled  the tables of the old alliance
broken  and all the objects of the ancient faith thrown in a heap to the
swine  a charter has been given to us   a resume of political science 
the monument of twenty legislatures  a code has been written   the pride
of a conqueror  and the summary of ancient wisdom  well  of this charter
and this code not one article shall be left standing upon another 
the time has come for the wise to choose their course  and prepare for
reconstruction 

but  since a destroyed error necessarily implies a counter truth  i will
not finish this treatise without solving the first problem of political
science   that which receives the attention of all minds 



when property is abolished  what will be the form of society  will it be
communism 



part second 



  1   of the causes of our mistakes  the origin of property 


the true form of human society cannot be determined until the following
question has been solved   

property not being our natural condition  how did it gain a foothold 
why has the social instinct  so trustworthy among the animals  erred
in the case of man  why is man  who was born for society  not yet
associated 

i have said that human society is complex in its nature  though this
expression is inaccurate  the fact to which it refers is none the less
true  namely  the classification of talents and capacities  but who
does not see that these talents and capacities  owing to their infinite
variety  give rise to an infinite variety of wills  and that the
character  the inclinations  and  if i may venture to use the
expression  the form of the ego  are necessarily changed  so that in
the order of liberty  as in the order of intelligence  there are as
many types as individuals  as many characters as heads  whose tastes 
fancies  and propensities  being modified by dissimilar ideas 
must necessarily conflict  man  by his nature and his instinct  is
predestined to society  but his personality  ever varying  is adverse to
it 

in societies of animals  all the members do exactly the same things 
the same genius directs them  the same will animates them  a society of
beasts is a collection of atoms  round  hooked  cubical  or triangular 
but always perfectly identical  these personalities do not vary  and we
might say that a single ego governs them all  the labors which animals
perform  whether alone or in society  are exact reproductions of their
character  just as the swarm of bees is composed of individual bees 
alike in nature and equal in value  so the honeycomb is formed of
individual cells  constantly and invariably repeated 

but man s intelligence  fitted for his social destiny and his personal
needs  is of a very different composition  and therefore gives rise to
a wonderful variety of human wills  in the bee  the will is constant
and uniform  because the instinct which guides it is invariable  and
constitutes the animal s whole life and nature  in man  talent varies 
and the mind wavers  consequently  his will is multiform and vague  he
seeks society  but dislikes constraint and monotony  he is an imitator 
but fond of his own ideas  and passionately in love with his works 

if  like the bees  every man were born possessed of talent  perfect
knowledge of certain kinds  and  in a word  an innate acquaintance
with the functions he has to perform  but destitute of reflective and
reasoning faculties  society would organize itself  we should see one
man plowing a field  another building houses  this one forging metals 
that one cutting clothes  and still others storing the products  and
superintending their distribution  each one  without inquiring as to the
object of his labor  and without troubling himself about the extent of
his task  would obey orders  bring his product  receive his salary  and
would then rest for a time  keeping meanwhile no accounts  envious of
nobody  and satisfied with the distributor  who never would be unjust to
any one  kings would govern  but would not reign  for to reign is to be
a  proprietor a l engrais   as bonaparte said  and having no commands
to give  since all would be at their posts  they would serve rather as
rallying centres than as authorities or counsellors  it would be a state
of ordered communism  but not a society entered into deliberately and
freely 

but man acquires skill only by observation and experiment  he reflects 
then  since to observe and experiment is to reflect  he reasons 
since he cannot help reasoning  in reflecting  he becomes deluded  in
reasoning  he makes mistakes  and  thinking himself right  persists in
them  he is wedded to his opinions  he esteems himself  and despises
others  consequently  he isolates himself  for he could not submit
to the majority without renouncing his will and his reason   that is 
without disowning himself  which is impossible  and this isolation  this
intellectual egotism  this individuality of opinion  lasts until the
truth is demonstrated to him by observation and experience  a final
illustration will make these facts still clearer 

if to the blind but convergent and harmonious instincts of a swarm
of bees should be suddenly added reflection and judgment  the little
society could not long exist  in the first place  the bees would not
fail to try some new industrial process  for instance  that of making
their cells round or square  all sorts of systems and inventions would
be tried  until long experience  aided by geometry  should show them
that the hexagonal shape is the best  then insurrections would occur 
the drones would be told to provide for themselves  and the queens to
labor  jealousy would spread among the laborers  discords would burst
forth  soon each one would want to produce on his own account  and
finally the hive would be abandoned  and the bees would perish  evil
would be introduced into the honey producing republic by the power of
reflection   the very faculty which ought to constitute its glory 

thus  moral evil  or  in this case  disorder in society  is naturally
explained by our power of reflection  the mother of poverty  crime 
insurrection  and war was inequality of conditions  which was the
daughter of property  which was born of selfishness  which was
engendered by private opinion  which descended in a direct line from
the autocracy of reason  man  in his infancy  is neither criminal
nor barbarous  but ignorant and inexperienced  endowed with imperious
instincts which are under the control of his reasoning faculty  at first
he reflects but little  and reasons inaccurately  then  benefiting by
his mistakes  he rectifies his ideas  and perfects his reason  in the
first place  it is the savage sacrificing all his possessions for
a trinket  and then repenting and weeping  it is esau selling his
birthright for a mess of pottage  and afterwards wishing to cancel
the bargain  it is the civilized workman laboring in insecurity  and
continually demanding that his wages be increased  neither he nor his
employer understanding that  in the absence of equality  any salary 
however large  is always insufficient  then it is naboth dying to defend
his inheritance  cato tearing out his entrails that he might not be
enslaved  socrates drinking the fatal cup in defence of liberty of
thought  it is the third estate of  89 reclaiming its liberty  soon it
will be the people demanding equality of wages and an equal division of
the means of production 

man is born a social being   that is  he seeks equality and justice in
all his relations  but he loves independence and praise  the difficulty
of satisfying these various desires at the same time is the primary
cause of the despotism of the will  and the appropriation which results
from it  on the other hand  man always needs a market for his products 
unable to compare values of different kinds  he is satisfied to judge
approximately  according to his passion and caprice  and he engages in
dishonest commerce  which always results in wealth and poverty  thus 
the greatest evils which man suffers arise from the misuse of his social
nature  of this same justice of which he is so proud  and which he
applies with such deplorable ignorance 

the practice of justice is a science which  when once discovered
and diffused  will sooner or later put an end to social disorder  by
teaching us our rights and duties 

this progressive and painful education of our instinct  this slow
and imperceptible transformation of our spontaneous perceptions into
deliberate knowledge  does not take place among the animals  whose
instincts remain fixed  and never become enlightened 


 according to frederic cuvier  who has so clearly distinguished between
instinct and intelligence in animals   instinct is a natural and
inherent faculty  like feeling  irritability  or intelligence  the wolf
and the fox who recognize the traps in which they have been caught  and
who avoid them  the dog and the horse  who understand the meaning of
several of our words  and who obey us   thereby show  intelligence  
the dog who hides the remains of his dinner  the bee who constructs his
cell  the bird who builds his nest  act only from  instinct   even man
has instincts  it is a special instinct which leads the new born
child to suck  but  in man  almost every thing is accomplished by
intelligence  and intelligence supplements instinct  the opposite is
true of animals  their instinct is given them as a supplement to their
intelligence     flourens  analytical summary of the observations of f 
cuvier 

 we can form a clear idea of instinct only by admitting that animals
have in their  sensorium   images or innate and constant sensations 
which influence their actions in the same manner that ordinary and
accidental sensations commonly do  it is a sort of dream  or vision 
which always follows them and in all which relates to instinct they may
be regarded as somnambulists    f  cuvier  introduction to the animal
kingdom 


intelligence and instinct being common  then  though in different
degrees  to animals and man  what is the distinguishing characteristic
of the latter  according to f  cuvier  it is reflection or the power
of intellectually considering our own modifications by a survey of
ourselves  this lacks clearness  and requires an explanation 

if we grant intelligence to animals  we must also grant them  in some
degree  reflection  for  the first cannot exist without the second  as
f  cuvier himself has proved by numerous examples  but notice that the
learned observer defines the kind of reflection which distinguishes us
from the animals as the power of considering our own modifications  this
i shall endeavour to interpret  by developing to the best of my ability
the laconism of the philosophical naturalist 

the intelligence acquired by animals never modifies the operations which
they perform by instinct  it is given them only as a provision against
unexpected accidents which might disturb these operations  in man  on
the contrary  instinctive action is constantly changing into deliberate
action  thus  man is social by instinct  and is every day becoming
social by reflection and choice  at first  he formed his words by
instinct  1  he was a poet by inspiration  to day  he makes grammar a
science  and poetry an art  his conception of god and a future life is
spontaneous and instinctive  and his expressions of this conception
have been  by turns  monstrous  eccentric  beautiful  comforting  and
terrible  all these different creeds  at which the frivolous irreligion
of the eighteenth century mocked  are modes of expression of the
religious sentiment  some day  man will explain to himself the character
of the god whom he believes in  and the nature of that other world to
which his soul aspires 

 1   the problem of the origin of language is solved by the distinction
made by frederic cuvier between instinct and intelligence  language
is not a premeditated  arbitrary  or conventional device  nor is it
communicated or revealed to us by god  language is an instinctive and
unpremeditated creation of man  as the hive is of the bee  in this
sense  it may be said that language is not the work of man  since it is
not the work of his mind  further  the mechanism of language seems
more wonderful and ingenious when it is not regarded as the result of
reflection  this fact is one of the most curious and indisputable which
philology has observed  see  among other works  a latin essay by f  g 
bergmann  strasbourg  1839   in which the learned author explains how
the phonetic germ is born of sensation  how language passes through
three successive stages of development  why man  endowed at birth with
the instinctive faculty of creating a language  loses this faculty
as fast as his mind develops  and that the study of languages is real
natural history   in fact  a science  france possesses to day several
philologists of the first rank  endowed with rare talents and deep
philosophic insight   modest savants developing a science almost without
the knowledge of the public  devoting themselves to studies which are
scornfully looked down upon  and seeming to shun applause as much as
others seek it  


all that he does from instinct man despises  or  if he admires it  it
is as nature s work  not as his own  this explains the obscurity
which surrounds the names of early inventors  it explains also our
indifference to religious matters  and the ridicule heaped upon
religious customs  man esteems only the products of reflection and of
reason  the most wonderful works of instinct are  in his eyes  only
lucky god sends  he reserves the name discovery  i had almost said
creation  for the works of intelligence  instinct is the source of
passion and enthusiasm  it is intelligence which causes crime and
virtue 

in developing his intelligence  man makes use of not only his own
observations  but also those of others  he keeps an account of his
experience  and preserves the record  so that the race  as well as
the individual  becomes more and more intelligent  the animals do not
transmit their knowledge  that which each individual accumulates dies
with him 

it is not enough  then  to say that we are distinguished from the
animals by reflection  unless we mean thereby the constant tendency of
our instinct to become intelligence  while man is governed by instinct 
he is unconscious of his acts  he never would deceive himself  and never
would be troubled by errors  evils  and disorder  if  like the animals 
instinct were his only guide  but the creator has endowed us with
reflection  to the end that our instinct might become intelligence 
and since this reflection and resulting knowledge pass through various
stages  it happens that in the beginning our instinct is opposed  rather
than guided  by reflection  consequently  that our power of thought
leads us to act in opposition to our nature and our end  that  deceiving
ourselves  we do and suffer evil  until instinct which points us towards
good  and reflection which makes us stumble into evil  are replaced by
the science of good and evil  which invariably causes us to seek the one
and avoid the other 

thus  evil  or error and its consequences  is the firstborn son of
the union of two opposing faculties  instinct and reflection  good 
or truth  must inevitably be the second child  or  to again employ the
figure  evil is the product of incest between adverse powers  good will
sooner or later be the legitimate child of their holy and mysterious
union 

property  born of the reasoning faculty  intrenches itself behind
comparisons  but  just as reflection and reason are subsequent to
spontaneity  observation to sensation  and experience to instinct  so
property is subsequent to communism  communism  or association in a
simple form  is the necessary object and original aspiration of the
social nature  the spontaneous movement by which it manifests and
establishes itself  it is the first phase of human civilization  in this
state of society   which the jurists have called negative communism  man
draws near to man  and shares with him the fruits of the field and the
milk and flesh of animals  little by little this communism  negative
as long as man does not produce  tends to become positive and organic
through the development of labor and industry  but it is then that the
sovereignty of thought  and the terrible faculty of reasoning logically
or illogically  teach man that  if equality is the sine qua non of
society  communism is the first species of slavery  to express this idea
by an hegelian formula  i will say 

communism  the first expression of the social nature  is the first term
of social development   the thesis  property  the reverse of communism 
is the second term   the antithesis  when we have discovered the third
term  the synthesis  we shall have the required solution  now  this
synthesis necessarily results from the correction of the thesis by the
antithesis  therefore it is necessary  by a final examination of their
characteristics  to eliminate those features which are hostile to
sociability  the union of the two remainders will give us the true form
of human association 



  2   characteristics of communism and of property 


i  i ought not to conceal the fact that property and communism have been
considered always the only possible forms of society  this deplorable
error has been the life of property  the disadvantages of communism are
so obvious that its critics never have needed to employ much eloquence
to thoroughly disgust men with it  the irreparability of the injustice
which it causes  the violence which it does to attractions and
repulsions  the yoke of iron which it fastens upon the will  the moral
torture to which it subjects the conscience  the debilitating effect
which it has upon society  and  to sum it all up  the pious and
stupid uniformity which it enforces upon the free  active  reasoning 
unsubmissive personality of man  have shocked common sense  and
condemned communism by an irrevocable decree 

the authorities and examples cited in its favor disprove it  the
communistic republic of plato involved slavery  that of lycurgus
employed helots  whose duty it was to produce for their masters  thus
enabling the latter to devote themselves exclusively to athletic sports
and to war  even j  j  rousseau  confounding communism and equality  has
said somewhere that  without slavery  he did not think equality of
conditions possible  the communities of the early church did not last
the first century out  and soon degenerated into monasteries  in those
of the jesuits of paraguay  the condition of the blacks is said by all
travellers to be as miserable as that of slaves  and it is a fact that
the good fathers were obliged to surround themselves with ditches and
walls to prevent their new converts from escaping  the followers
of baboeuf  guided by a lofty horror of property rather than by any
definite belief  were ruined by exaggeration of their principles  the
st  simonians  lumping communism and inequality  passed away like a
masquerade  the greatest danger to which society is exposed to day is
that of another shipwreck on this rock 

singularly enough  systematic communism  the deliberate negation of
property  is conceived under the direct influence of the proprietary
prejudice  and property is the basis of all communistic theories 

the members of a community  it is true  have no private property  but
the community is proprietor  and proprietor not only of the goods  but
of the persons and wills  in consequence of this principle of absolute
property  labor  which should be only a condition imposed upon man by
nature  becomes in all communities a human commandment  and therefore
odious  passive obedience  irreconcilable with a reflecting will  is
strictly enforced  fidelity to regulations  which are always defective 
however wise they may be thought  allows of no complaint  life  talent 
and all the human faculties are the property of the state  which has
the right to use them as it pleases for the common good  private
associations are sternly prohibited  in spite of the likes and dislikes
of different natures  because to tolerate them would be to introduce
small communities within the large one  and consequently private
property  the strong work for the weak  although this ought to be left
to benevolence  and not enforced  advised  or enjoined  the industrious
work for the lazy  although this is unjust  the clever work for the
foolish  although this is absurd  and  finally  man  casting aside his
personality  his spontaneity  his genius  and his affections  humbly
annihilates himself at the feet of the majestic and inflexible commune 

communism is inequality  but not as property is  property is the
exploitation of the weak by the strong  communism is the exploitation
of the strong by the weak  in property  inequality of conditions is
the result of force  under whatever name it be disguised  physical and
mental force  force of events  chance  fortune  force of accumulated
property  &c  in communism  inequality springs from placing mediocrity
on a level with excellence  this damaging equation is repellent to the
conscience  and causes merit to complain  for  although it may be
the duty of the strong to aid the weak  they prefer to do it out of
generosity   they never will endure a comparison  give them equal
opportunities of labor  and equal wages  but never allow their jealousy
to be awakened by mutual suspicion of unfaithfulness in the performance
of the common task 

communism is oppression and slavery  man is very willing to obey the
law of duty  serve his country  and oblige his friends  but he wishes to
labor when he pleases  where he pleases  and as much as he pleases  he
wishes to dispose of his own time  to be governed only by necessity  to
choose his friendships  his recreation  and his discipline  to act from
judgment  not by command  to sacrifice himself through selfishness  not
through servile obligation  communism is essentially opposed to the
free exercise of our faculties  to our noblest desires  to our deepest
feelings  any plan which could be devised for reconciling it with the
demands of the individual reason and will would end only in changing the
thing while preserving the name  now  if we are honest truth seekers  we
shall avoid disputes about words 

thus  communism violates the sovereignty of the conscience  and
equality  the first  by restricting spontaneity of mind and heart 
and freedom of thought and action  the second  by placing labor and
laziness  skill and stupidity  and even vice and virtue on an equality
in point of comfort  for the rest  if property is impossible on account
of the desire to accumulate  communism would soon become so through the
desire to shirk 


ii  property  in its turn  violates equality by the rights of exclusion
and increase  and freedom by despotism  the former effect of property
having been sufficiently developed in the last three chapters  i will
content myself here with establishing by a final comparison  its perfect
identity with robbery 

the latin words for robber are  fur  and  latro   the former taken from
the greek  greek m    from  greek m    latin  fero   i carry away  the
latter from  greek  i    i play the part of a brigand  which is derived
from  greek i    latin  lateo   i conceal myself  the greeks have also
 greek ncg    from  greek ncg    i filch  whose radical consonants are
the same as those of  greek   cg    i cover  i conceal  thus  in these
languages  the idea of a robber is that of a man who conceals  carries
away  or diverts  in any manner whatever  a thing which does not belong
to him 

the hebrews expressed the same idea by the word  gannab    robber   from
the verb  ganab   which means to put away  to turn aside   lo thi gnob
 decalogue  eighth commandment    thou shalt not steal   that is  thou
shalt not hold back  thou shalt not put away any thing for thyself  that
is the act of a man who  on entering into a society into which he
agrees to bring all that he has  secretly reserves a portion  as did the
celebrated disciple ananias 

the etymology of the french verb  voler  is still more significant 
 voler   or  faire la vole   from the latin  vola   palm of the hand  
means to take all the tricks in a game of ombre  so that  le voleur  
the robber  is the capitalist who takes all  who gets the lion s share 
probably this verb  voler  had its origin in the professional slang of
thieves  whence it has passed into common use  and  consequently into
the phraseology of the law 

robbery is committed in a variety of ways  which have been very
cleverly distinguished and classified by legislators according to their
heinousness or merit  to the end that some robbers may be honored  while
others are punished 

we rob   1  by murder on the highway  2  alone  or in a band  3  by
breaking into buildings  or scaling walls  4  by abstraction  5  by
fraudulent bankruptcy  6  by forgery of the handwriting of public
officials or private individuals  7  by manufacture of counterfeit
money 

this species includes all robbers who practise their profession with no
other aid than force and open fraud  bandits  brigands  pirates  rovers
by land and sea   these names were gloried in by the ancient heroes  who
thought their profession as noble as it was lucrative  nimrod  theseus 
jason and his argonauts  jephthah  david  cacus  romulus  clovis and
all his merovingian descendants  robert guiscard  tancred de hauteville 
bohemond  and most of the norman heroes   were brigands and robbers  the
heroic character of the robber is expressed in this line from horace  in
reference to achilles   

           jura neget sibi nata  nihil non arroget armis     27 
and by this sentence from the dying words of jacob  gen  xlviii    which
the jews apply to david  and the christians to their christ   manus ejus
contra omnes   in our day  the robber  the warrior of the ancients  is
pursued with the utmost vigor  his profession  in the language of the
code  entails ignominious and corporal penalties  from imprisonment to
the scaffold  a sad change in opinions here below 

we rob   8  by cheating  9  by swindling  10  by abuse of trust  11  by
games and lotteries 

this second species was encouraged by the laws of lycurgus  in order
to sharpen the wits of the young  it is the kind practised by ulysses 
solon  and sinon  by the ancient and modern jews  from jacob down to
deutz  and by the bohemians  the arabs  and all savage tribes  under
louis xiii  and louis xiv   it was not considered dishonorable to cheat
at play  to do so was a part of the game  and many worthy people did not
scruple to correct the caprice of fortune by dexterous jugglery 
to day even  and in all countries  it is thought a mark of merit
among peasants  merchants  and shopkeepers to know how to make a
bargain   that is  to deceive one s man  this is so universally
accepted  that the cheated party takes no offence  it is known with what
reluctance our government resolved upon the abolition of lotteries  it
felt that it was dealing a stab thereby at property  the pickpocket 
the blackleg  and the charlatan make especial use of their dexterity of
hand  their subtlety of mind  the magic power of their eloquence 
and their great fertility of invention  sometimes they offer bait to
cupidity  therefore the penal code  which much prefers intelligence
to muscular vigor  has made  of the four varieties mentioned above 
a second category  liable only to correctional  not to ignominious 
punishments 

let them now accuse the law of being materialistic and atheistic 

we rob   12  by usury 

this species of robbery  so odious and so severely punished since the
publication of the gospel  is the connecting link between forbidden and
authorized robbery  owing to its ambiguous nature  it has given rise to
a multitude of contradictions in the laws and in morals   contradictions
which have been very cleverly turned to account by lawyers  financiers 
and merchants  thus the usurer  who lends on mortgage at ten  twelve 
and fifteen per cent   is heavily fined when detected  while the banker 
who receives the same interest  not  it is true  upon a loan  but in the
way of exchange or discount   that is  of sale   is protected by royal
privilege  but the distinction between the banker and the usurer is
a purely nominal one  like the usurer  who lends on property  real or
personal  the banker lends on business paper  like the usurer  he
takes his interest in advance  like the usurer  he can recover from
the borrower if the property is destroyed  that is  if the note is
not redeemed    a circumstance which makes him a money lender  not a
money seller  but the banker lends for a short time only  while
the usurer s loan may be for one  two  three  or more years  now  a
difference in the duration of the loan  or the form of the act  does not
alter the nature of the transaction  as for the capitalists who invest
their money  either with the state or in commercial operations  at
three  four  and five per cent    that is  who lend on usury at a
little lower rate than the bankers and usurers   they are the flower of
society  the cream of honesty  moderation in robbery is the height of
virtue   28 

but what  then  is usury  nothing is more amusing than to see these
instructors of nations hesitate between the authority of the gospel 
which  they say  never can have spoken in vain  and the authority of
economical demonstrations  nothing  to my mind  is more creditable
to the gospel than this old infidelity of its pretended teachers 
salmasius  having assimilated interest to rent  was refuted by grotius 
pufendorf  burlamaqui  wolf  and heineccius  and  what is more curious
still  salmasius admitted his error  instead of inferring from this
doctrine of salmasius that all increase is illegitimate  and proceeding
straight on to the demonstration of gospel equality  they arrived at
just the opposite conclusion  namely  that since everybody acknowledges
that rent is permissible  if we allow that interest does not differ
from rent  there is nothing left which can be called usury  and 
consequently  that the commandment of jesus christ is an illusion  and
amounts to nothing  which is an impious conclusion 

if this memoir had appeared in the time of bossuet  that great
theologian would have proved by scripture  the fathers  traditions 
councils  and popes  that property exists by divine right  while usury
is an invention of the devil  and the heretical work would have been
burned  and the author imprisoned 


we rob   13  by farm rent  house rent  and leases of all kinds 

the author of the  provincial letters  entertained the honest christians
of the seventeenth century at the expense of escobar  the jesuit 
and the contract mohatra   the contract mohatra   said escobar   is a
contract by which goods are bought  at a high price and on credit  to
be again sold at the same moment to the same person  cash down  and at a
lower price   escobar found a way to justify this kind of usury  pascal
and all the jansenists laughed at him  but what would the satirical
pascal  the learned nicole  and the invincible arnaud have said  if
father antoine escobar de valladolid had answered them thus   a lease
is a contract by which real estate is bought  at a high price and on
credit  to be again sold  at the expiration of a certain time  to the
same person  at a lower price  only  to simplify the transaction  the
buyer is content to pay the difference between the first sale and the
second  either deny the identity of the lease and the contract mohatra 
and then i will annihilate you in a moment  or  if you admit the
similarity  admit also the soundness of my doctrine  otherwise you
proscribe both interest and rent at one blow  

in reply to this overwhelming argument of the jesuit  the sire of
montalte would have sounded the tocsin  and would have shouted
that society was in peril   that the jesuits were sapping its very
foundations 

we rob   14  by commerce  when the profit of the merchant exceeds his
legitimate salary 

everybody knows the definition of commerce  the art of buying for three
francs that which is worth six  and of selling for six that which is
worth three  between commerce thus defined and  vol a l americaine  
the only difference is in the relative proportion of the values
exchanged   in short  in the amount of the profit 

we rob   15  by making profit on our product  by accepting sinecures 
and by exacting exorbitant wages 

the farmer  who sells a certain amount of corn to the consumer  and who
during the measurement thrusts his hand into the bushel and takes out a
handful of grains  robs  the professor  whose lectures are paid for by
the state  and who through the intervention of a bookseller sells them
to the public a second time  robs  the sinecurist  who receives an
enormous product in exchange for his vanity  robs  the functionary  the
laborer  whatever he may be  who produces only one and gets paid four 
one hundred  or one thousand  robs  the publisher of this book  and i 
its author   we rob  by charging for it twice as much as it is worth 

in recapitulation   

justice  after passing through the state of negative communism  called
by the ancient poets the age of gold  commences as the right of the
strongest  in a society which is trying to organize itself  inequality
of faculties calls up the idea of merit  equite suggests the plan of
proportioning not only esteem  but also material comforts  to personal
merit  and since the highest and almost the only merit then recognized
is physical strength  the strongest   greek   eg    and consequently
the best   greek   eg    is entitled to the largest share  and if it
is refused him  he very naturally takes it by force  from this to the
assumption of the right of property in all things  it is but one step 

such was justice in the heroic age  preserved  at least by tradition 
among the greeks and romans down to the last days of their republics 
plato  in the  gorgias   introduces a character named callicles  who
spiritedly defends the right of the strongest  which socrates  the
advocate of equality   greek g e     seriously refutes   it is related
of the great pompey  that he blushed easily  and  nevertheless  these
words once escaped his lips   why should i respect the laws  when i have
arms in my hand   this shows him to have been a man in whom the moral
sense and ambition were struggling for the mastery  and who sought to
justify his violence by the motto of the hero and the brigand 

from the right of the strongest springs the exploitation of man by
man  or bondage  usury  or the tribute levied upon the conquered by the
conqueror  and the whole numerous family of taxes  duties  monarchical
prerogatives  house rents  farm rents  &c   in one word   property 

force was followed by artifice  the second manifestation of justice 
which was detested by the ancient heroes  who  not excelling in that
direction  were heavy losers by it  force was still employed  but mental
force instead of physical  skill in deceiving an enemy by treacherous
propositions seemed deserving of reward  nevertheless  the strong always
prided themselves upon their honesty  in those days  oaths were observed
and promises kept according to the letter rather than the spirit   uti
lingua nuncupassit  ita jus esto     as the tongue has spoken  so must
the right be   says the law of the twelve tables  artifice  or rather
perfidy  was the main element in the politics of ancient rome  among
other examples  vico cites the following  also quoted by montesquieu 
the romans had guaranteed to the carthaginians the preservation of their
goods and their city   intentionally using the word civitas  that is 
the society  the state  the carthaginians  on the contrary  understood
them to mean the material city  urbs  and accordingly began to rebuild
their walls  they were immediately attacked on account of their
violation of the treaty  by the romans  who  acting upon the old
heroic idea of right  did not imagine that  in taking advantage of an
equivocation to surprise their enemies  they were waging unjust war 

from artifice sprang the profits of manufactures  commerce  and banking 
mercantile frauds  and pretensions which are honored with the beautiful
names of talent and genius  but which ought to be regarded as the last
degree of knavery and deception  and  finally  all sorts of social
inequalities 

in those forms of robbery which are prohibited by law  force and
artifice are employed alone and undisguised  in the authorized forms 
they conceal themselves within a useful product  which they use as a
tool to plunder their victim 

the direct use of violence and stratagem was early and universally
condemned  but no nation has yet got rid of that kind of robbery which
acts through talent  labor  and possession  and which is the source
of all the dilemmas of casuistry and the innumerable contradictions of
jurisprudence 

the right of force and the right of artifice  glorified by the
rhapsodists in the poems of the  iliad  and the  odyssey   inspired the
legislation of the greeks and romans  from which they passed into our
morals and codes  christianity has not changed at all  the gospel should
not be blamed  because the priests  as stupid as the legists  have been
unable either to expound or to understand it  the ignorance of councils
and popes upon all questions of morality is equal to that of the
market place and the money changers  and it is this utter ignorance
of right  justice  and society  which is killing the church  and
discrediting its teachings for ever  the infidelity of the roman church
and other christian churches is flagrant  all have disregarded the
precept of jesus  all have erred in moral and doctrinal points  all
are guilty of teaching false and absurd dogmas  which lead straight to
wickedness and murder  let it ask pardon of god and men   this church
which called itself infallible  and which has grown so corrupt in
morals  let its reformed sisters humble themselves     and the people 
undeceived  but still religious and merciful  will begin to think   29 

one of the main causes of ireland s poverty to day is the immense
revenues of the english clergy  so heretics and orthodox  protestants
and papists  cannot reproach each other  all have strayed from the path
of justice  all have disobeyed the eighth commandment of the decalogue 
 thou shalt not steal  


the development of right has followed the same order  in its various
expressions  that property has in its forms  every where we see justice
driving robbery before it and confining it within narrower and narrower
limits  hitherto the victories of justice over injustice  and of
equality over inequality  have been won by instinct and the simple force
of things  but the final triumph of our social nature will be due to
our reason  or else we shall fall back into feudal chaos  either this
glorious height is reserved for our intelligence  or this miserable
depth for our baseness 

the second effect of property is despotism  now  since despotism
is inseparably connected with the idea of legitimate authority  in
explaining the natural causes of the first  the principle of the second
will appear 

what is to be the form of government in the future  hear some of my
younger readers reply   why  how can you ask such a question 

 you are a republican    a republican  yes  but that word specifies
nothing   res publica   that is  the public thing  now  whoever
is interested in public affairs  no matter under what form
of government  may call himself a republican  even kings are
republicans    


 well  you are a democrat     no     what  you would have a
monarchy     no     a constitutionalist     god forbid     you are then
an aristocrat     not at all     you want a mixed government     still
less     what are you  then     i am an anarchist  

 oh  i understand you  you speak satirically  this is a hit at the
government     by no means  i have just given you my serious and
well considered profession of faith  although a firm friend of order  i
am  in the full force of the term  an anarchist  listen to me  


in all species of sociable animals   the weakness of the young is the
principle of their obedience to the old   who are strong  and from habit 
which is a kind of conscience with them  the power remains with the
oldest  although he finally becomes the weakest 

whenever the society is under the control of a chief  this chief is
almost always the oldest of the troop  i say almost always  because
the established order may be disturbed by violent outbreaks  then the
authority passes to another  and  having been re established by force 
it is again maintained by habit  wild horses go in herds  they have a
chief who marches at their head  whom they confidently follow  and who
gives the signal for flight or battle 

 the sheep which we have raised follows us  but it follows in company
with the flock in the midst of which it was born  it regards man as the
chief of its flock     man is regarded by domestic animals as a member
of their society  all that he has to do is to get himself accepted by
them as an associate  he soon becomes their chief  in consequence of his
superior intelligence  he does not  then  change the natural condition
of these animals  as buffon has said  on the contrary  he uses this
natural condition to his own advantage  in other words  he finds
sociable animals  and renders them domestic by becoming their associate
and chief  thus  the domesticity of animals is only a special condition 
a simple modification  a definitive consequence of their sociability 
all domestic animals are by nature sociable animals       flourens 
summary of the observations of f  cuvier 


sociable animals follow their chief by instinct  but take notice of the
fact  which f  cuvier omitted to state   that the function of the chief
is altogether one of intelligence  the chief does not teach the others
to associate  to unite under his lead  to reproduce their kind  to
take to flight  or to defend themselves  concerning each of these
particulars  his subordinates are as well informed as he  but it is the
chief who  by his accumulated experience  provides against accidents  he
it is whose private intelligence supplements  in difficult situations 
the general instinct  he it is who deliberates  decides  and leads  he
it is  in short  whose enlightened prudence regulates the public routine
for the greatest good of all 

man  naturally a sociable being  naturally follows a chief  originally 
the chief is the father  the patriarch  the elder  in other words  the
good and wise man  whose functions  consequently  are exclusively of a
reflective and intellectual nature  the human race  like all other
races of sociable animals  has its instincts  its innate faculties  its
general ideas  and its categories of sentiment and reason  its chiefs 
legislators  or kings have devised nothing  supposed nothing  imagined
nothing  they have only guided society by their accumulated experience 
always however in conformity with opinions and beliefs 

those philosophers who  carrying into morals and into history their
gloomy and factious whims  affirm that the human race had originally
neither chiefs nor kings  know nothing of the nature of man  royalty 
and absolute royalty  is  as truly and more truly than democracy  a
primitive form of government  perceiving that  in the remotest ages 
crowns and kingships were worn by heroes  brigands  and knight errants 
they confound the two things   royalty and despotism  but royalty dates
from the creation of man  it existed in the age of negative communism 
ancient heroism  and the despotism which it engendered  commenced only
with the first manifestation of the idea of justice  that is  with the
reign of force  as soon as the strongest  in the comparison of merits 
was decided to be the best  the oldest had to abandon his position  and
royalty became despotic 

the spontaneous  instinctive  and  so to speak  physiological origin of
royalty gives it  in the beginning  a superhuman character  the
nations connected it with the gods  from whom they said the first kings
descended  this notion was the origin of the divine genealogies of royal
families  the incarnations of gods  and the messianic fables  from it
sprang the doctrine of divine right  which is still championed by a few
singular characters 

royalty was at first elective  because  at a time when man produced but
little and possessed nothing  property was too weak to establish the
principle of heredity  and secure to the son the throne of his father 
but as soon as fields were cleared  and cities built  each function
was  like every thing else  appropriated  and hereditary kingships and
priesthoods were the result  the principle of heredity was carried into
even the most ordinary professions   a circumstance which led to class
distinctions  pride of station  and abjection of the common people  and
which confirms my assertion  concerning the principle of patrimonial
succession  that it is a method suggested by nature of filling vacancies
in business  and completing unfinished tasks 

from time to time  ambition caused usurpers  or supplanters of kings 
to start up  and  in consequence  some were called kings by right  or
legitimate kings  and others tyrants  but we must not let these names
deceive us  there have been execrable kings  and very tolerable tyrants 
royalty may always be good  when it is the only possible form of
government  legitimate it is never  neither heredity  nor election 
nor universal suffrage  nor the excellence of the sovereign  nor the
consecration of religion and of time  can make royalty legitimate 
whatever form it takes   monarchic  oligarchic  or democratic   royalty 
or the government of man by man  is illegitimate and absurd 

man  in order to procure as speedily as possible the most thorough
satisfaction of his wants  seeks rule  in the beginning  this rule is
to him living  visible  and tangible  it is his father  his master  his
king  the more ignorant man is  the more obedient he is  and the more
absolute is his confidence in his guide  but  it being a law of man s
nature to conform to rule   that is  to discover it by his powers of
reflection and reason   man reasons upon the commands of his chiefs 
now  such reasoning as that is a protest against authority   a beginning
of disobedience  at the moment that man inquires into the motives which
govern the will of his sovereign   at that moment man revolts  if
he obeys no longer because the king commands  but because the king
demonstrates the wisdom of his commands  it may be said that henceforth
he will recognize no authority  and that he has become his own king 
unhappy he who shall dare to command him  and shall offer  as his
authority  only the vote of the majority  for  sooner or later  the
minority will become the majority  and this imprudent despot will be
overthrown  and all his laws annihilated 

in proportion as society becomes enlightened  royal authority
diminishes  that is a fact to which all history bears witness  at the
birth of nations  men reflect and reason in vain  without methods 
without principles  not knowing how to use their reason  they cannot
judge of the justice of their conclusions  then the authority of kings
is immense  no knowledge having been acquired with which to contradict
it  but  little by little  experience produces habits  which develop
into customs  then the customs are formulated in maxims  laid down as
principles   in short  transformed into laws  to which the king  the
living law  has to bow  there comes a time when customs and laws are so
numerous that the will of the prince is  so to speak  entwined by the
public will  and that  on taking the crown  he is obliged to swear that
he will govern in conformity with established customs and usages  and
that he is but the executive power of a society whose laws are made
independently of him 

up to this point  all is done instinctively  and  as it were 
unconsciously  but see where this movement must end 

by means of self instruction and the acquisition of ideas  man finally
acquires the idea of science   that is  of a system of knowledge in
harmony with the reality of things  and inferred from observation 
he searches for the science  or the system  of inanimate bodies   the
system of organic bodies  the system of the human mind  and the system
of the universe  why should he not also search for the system of
society  but  having reached this height  he comprehends that political
truth  or the science of politics  exists quite independently of
the will of sovereigns  the opinion of majorities  and popular
beliefs   that kings  ministers  magistrates  and nations  as wills 
have no connection with the science  and are worthy of no consideration 
he comprehends  at the same time  that  if man is born a sociable being 
the authority of his father over him ceases on the day when  his mind
being formed and his education finished  he becomes the associate of his
father  that his true chief and his king is the demonstrated truth  that
politics is a science  not a stratagem  and that the function of the
legislator is reduced  in the last analysis  to the methodical search
for truth 

thus  in a given society  the authority of man over man is inversely
proportional to the stage of intellectual development which that
society has reached  and the probable duration of that authority can
be calculated from the more or less general desire for a true
government   that is  for a scientific government  and just as the right
of force and the right of artifice retreat before the steady advance
of justice  and must finally be extinguished in equality  so the
sovereignty of the will yields to the sovereignty of the reason  and
must at last be lost in scientific socialism  property and royalty
have been crumbling to pieces ever since the world began  as man seeks
justice in equality  so society seeks order in anarchy 

anarchy   the absence of a master  of a sovereign   30   such is the
form of government to which we are every day approximating  and which
our accustomed habit of taking man for our rule  and his will for law 
leads us to regard as the height of disorder and the expression of
chaos  the story is told  that a citizen of paris in the seventeenth
century having heard it said that in venice there was no king  the
good man could not recover from his astonishment  and nearly died from
laughter at the mere mention of so ridiculous a thing  so strong is our
prejudice  as long as we live  we want a chief or chiefs  and at this
very moment i hold in my hand a brochure  whose author  a zealous
communist  dreams  like a second marat  of the dictatorship  the most
advanced among us are those who wish the greatest possible number of
sovereigns   their most ardent wish is for the royalty of the national
guard  soon  undoubtedly  some one  jealous of the citizen militia  will
say   everybody is king   but  when he has spoken  i will say  in my
turn   nobody is king  we are  whether we will or no  associated  
every question of domestic politics must be decided by departmental
statistics  every question of foreign politics is an affair of
international statistics  the science of government rightly belongs
to one of the sections of the academy of sciences  whose permanent
secretary is necessarily prime minister  and  since every citizen may
address a memoir to the academy  every citizen is a legislator  but  as
the opinion of no one is of any value until its truth has been proven 
no one can substitute his will for reason   nobody is king 


all questions of legislation and politics are matters of science  not of
opinion  the legislative power belongs only to the reason  methodically
recognized and demonstrated  to attribute to any power whatever the
right of veto or of sanction  is the last degree of tyranny  justice
and legality are two things as independent of our approval as is
mathematical truth  to compel  they need only to be known  to be known 
they need only to be considered and studied  what  then  is the nation 
if it is not the sovereign   if it is not the source of the legislative
power 

the nation is the guardian of the law  the nation is the executive
power  every citizen may assert   this is true  that is just   but his
opinion controls no one but himself  that the truth which he proclaims
may become a law  it must be recognized  now  what is it to recognize a
law  it is to verify a mathematical or a metaphysical calculation  it is
to repeat an experiment  to observe a phenomenon  to establish a fact 
only the nation has the right to say   be it known and decreed  

i confess that this is an overturning of received ideas  and that i seem
to be attempting to revolutionize our political system  but i beg the
reader to consider that  having begun with a paradox  i must  if i
reason correctly  meet with paradoxes at every step  and must end with
paradoxes  for the rest  i do not see how the liberty of citizens would
be endangered by entrusting to their hands  instead of the pen of
the legislator  the sword of the law  the executive power  belonging
properly to the will  cannot be confided to too many proxies  that is
the true sovereignty of the nation   31 


the proprietor  the robber  the hero  the sovereign  for all these
titles are synonymous  imposes his will as law  and suffers neither
contradiction nor control  that is  he pretends to be the legislative
and the executive power at once  accordingly  the substitution of the
scientific and true law for the royal will is accomplished only by a
terrible struggle  and this constant substitution is  after property 
the most potent element in history  the most prolific source of
political disturbances  examples are too numerous and too striking to
require enumeration 

now  property necessarily engenders despotism   the government of
caprice  the reign of libidinous pleasure  that is so clearly the
essence of property that  to be convinced of it  one need but remember
what it is  and observe what happens around him  property is the right
to use and abuse  if  then  government is economy   if its object
is production and consumption  and the distribution of labor and
products   how is government possible while property exists  and
if goods are property  why should not the proprietors be kings  and
despotic kings  kings in proportion to their  facultes bonitaires   and
if each proprietor is sovereign lord within the sphere of his property 
absolute king throughout his own domain  how could a government of
proprietors be any thing but chaos and confusion 



  3   determination of the third form of society  conclusion 


then  no government  no public economy  no administration  is possible 
which is based upon property 

communism seeks equality and law  property  born of the sovereignty of
the reason  and the sense of personal merit  wishes above all things
independence and proportionality 

but communism  mistaking uniformity for law  and levelism for
equality  becomes tyrannical and unjust  property  by its despotism and
encroachments  soon proves itself oppressive and anti social 

the objects of communism and property are good  their results are bad 
and why  because both are exclusive  and each disregards two elements
of society  communism rejects independence and proportionality  property
does not satisfy equality and law 

now  if we imagine a society based upon these four
principles   equality  law  independence  and proportionality   we
find   

1  that equality  consisting only in equality of conditions  that is  of
means  and not in equality of comfort   which it is the business of the
laborers to achieve for themselves  when provided with equal means   in
no way violates justice and equite 

2  that law  resulting from the knowledge of facts  and consequently
based upon necessity itself  never clashes with independence 

3  that individual independence  or the autonomy of the private reason 
originating in the difference in talents and capacities  can exist
without danger within the limits of the law 

4  that proportionality  being admitted only in the sphere of
intelligence and sentiment  and not as regards material objects  may be
observed without violating justice or social equality 

this third form of society  the synthesis of communism and property  we
will call liberty   32 


in determining the nature of liberty  we do not unite communism and
property indiscriminately  such a process would be absurd eclecticism 
we search by analysis for those elements in each which are true  and
in harmony with the laws of nature and society  disregarding the rest
altogether  and the result gives us an adequate expression of the
natural form of human society   in one word  liberty 

liberty is equality  because liberty exists only in society  and in the
absence of equality there is no society 

liberty is anarchy  because it does not admit the government of the
will  but only the authority of the law  that is  of necessity 

liberty is infinite variety  because it respects all wills within the
limits of the law 

liberty is proportionality  because it allows the utmost latitude to the
ambition for merit  and the emulation of glory 

we can now say  in the words of m  cousin   our principle is true  it is
good  it is social  let us not fear to push it to its ultimate  

man s social nature becoming justice through reflection  equite through
the classification of capacities  and having liberty for its formula 
is the true basis of morality   the principle and regulator of all our
actions  this is the universal motor  which philosophy is searching for 
which religion strengthens  which egotism supplants  and whose place
pure reason never can fill  duty and right are born of need  which  when
considered in connection with others  is a right  and when considered in
connection with ourselves  a duty 

we need to eat and sleep  it is our right to procure those things which
are necessary to rest and nourishment  it is our duty to use them when
nature requires it 

we need to labor in order to live  to do so is both our right and our
duty 

we need to love our wives and children  it is our duty to protect and
support them  it is our right to be loved in preference to all others 
conjugal fidelity is justice  adultery is high treason against society 

we need to exchange our products for other products  it is our right
that this exchange should be one of equivalents  and since we consume
before we produce  it would be our duty  if we could control the matter 
to see to it that our last product shall follow our last consumption 
suicide is fraudulent bankruptcy 

we need to live our lives according to the dictates of our reason  it
is our right to maintain our freedom  it is our duty to respect that of
others 

we need to be appreciated by our fellows  it is our duty to deserve
their praise  it is our right to be judged by our works 

liberty is not opposed to the rights of succession and bequest  it
contents itself with preventing violations of equality   choose   it
tells us   between two legacies  but do not take them both   all our
legislation concerning transmissions  entailments  adoptions  and  if i
may venture to use such a word  coadjutoreries  requires remodelling 

liberty favors emulation  instead of destroying it  in social equality 
emulation consists in accomplishing under like conditions  it is its own
reward  no one suffers by the victory 

liberty applauds self sacrifice  and honors it with its votes  but it
can dispense with it  justice alone suffices to maintain the social
equilibrium  self sacrifice is an act of supererogation  happy  however 
the man who can say   i sacrifice myself    33 


liberty is essentially an organizing force  to insure equality between
men and peace among nations  agriculture and industry  and the centres
of education  business  and storage  must be distributed according to
the climate and the geographical position of the country  the nature of
the products  the character and natural talents of the inhabitants  &c  
in proportions so just  so wise  so harmonious  that in no place shall
there ever be either an excess or a lack of population  consumption  and
products  there commences the science of public and private right 
the true political economy  it is for the writers on jurisprudence 
henceforth unembarrassed by the false principle of property  to describe
the new laws  and bring peace upon earth  knowledge and genius they do
not lack  the foundation is now laid for them   34 


i have accomplished my task  property is conquered  never again to
arise  wherever this work is read and discussed  there will be deposited
the germ of death to property  there  sooner or later  privilege and
servitude will disappear  and the despotism of will will give place to
the reign of reason  what sophisms  indeed  what prejudices
 however obstinate  can stand before the simplicity of the following
propositions   

i  individual possession  35  is the condition of social life  five
thousand years of property demonstrate it  property is the suicide of
society  possession is a right  property is against right  suppress
property while maintaining possession  and  by this simple modification
of the principle  you will revolutionize law  government  economy  and
institutions  you will drive evil from the face of the earth 

ii  all having an equal right of occupancy  possession varies with the
number of possessors  property cannot establish itself 

iii  the effect of labor being the same for all  property is lost in the
common prosperity 

iv  all human labor being the result of collective force  all property
becomes  in consequence  collective and unitary  to speak more exactly 
labor destroys property 

v  every capacity for labor being  like every instrument of labor  an
accumulated capital  and a collective property  inequality of wages
and fortunes  on the ground of inequality of capacities  is  therefore 
injustice and robbery 

vi  the necessary conditions of commerce are the liberty of the
contracting parties and the equivalence of the products exchanged 
now  value being expressed by the amount of time and outlay which each
product costs  and liberty being inviolable  the wages of laborers  like
their rights and duties  should be equal 

vii  products are bought only by products  now  the condition of all
exchange being equivalence of products  profit is impossible and unjust 
observe this elementary principle of economy  and pauperism  luxury 
oppression  vice  crime  and hunger will disappear from our midst 

viii  men are associated by the physical and mathematical law of
production  before they are voluntarily associated by choice  therefore 
equality of conditions is demanded by justice  that is  by strict social
law  esteem  friendship  gratitude  admiration  all fall within the
domain of equitable or proportional law only 

ix  free association  liberty  whose sole function is to maintain
equality in the means of production and equivalence in exchanges  is the
only possible  the only just  the only true form of society 

x  politics is the science of liberty  the government of man by man
 under whatever name it be disguised  is oppression  society finds its
highest perfection in the union of order with anarchy 

the old civilization has run its race  a new sun is rising  and will
soon renew the face of the earth  let the present generation perish  let
the old prevaricators die in the desert  the holy earth shall not cover
their bones  young man  exasperated by the corruption of the age  and
absorbed in your zeal for justice   if your country is dear to you 
and if you have the interests of humanity at heart  have the courage to
espouse the cause of liberty  cast off your old selfishness  and plunge
into the rising flood of popular equality  there your regenerate soul
will acquire new life and vigor  your enervated genius will recover
unconquerable energy  and your heart  perhaps already withered  will be
rejuvenated  every thing will wear a different look to your illuminated
vision  new sentiments will engender new ideas within you  religion 
morality  poetry  art  language will appear before you in nobler and
fairer forms  and thenceforth  sure of your faith  and thoughtfully
enthusiastic  you will hail the dawn of universal regeneration 

and you  sad victims of an odious law   you  whom a jesting world
despoils and outrages   you  whose labor has always been fruitless 
and whose rest has been without hope   take courage  your tears are
numbered  the fathers have sown in affliction  the children shall reap
in rejoicings 

o god of liberty  god of equality  thou who didst place in my heart
the sentiment of justice  before my reason could comprehend it  hear
my ardent prayer  thou hast dictated all that i have written  thou hast
shaped my thought  thou hast directed my studies  thou hast weaned my
mind from curiosity and my heart from attachment  that i might publish
thy truth to the master and the slave  i have spoken with what force and
talent thou hast given me  it is thine to finish the work  thou knowest
whether i seek my welfare or thy glory  o god of liberty  ah  perish
my memory  and let humanity be free  let me see from my obscurity
the people at last instructed  let noble teachers enlighten them  let
generous spirits guide them  abridge  if possible  the time of our
trial  stifle pride and avarice in equality  annihilate this love of
glory which enslaves us  teach these poor children that in the bosom
of liberty there are neither heroes nor great men  inspire the powerful
man  the rich man  him whose name my lips shall never pronounce in thy
presence  with a horror of his crimes  let him be the first to apply for
admission to the redeemed society  let the promptness of his repentance
be the ground of his forgiveness  then  great and small  wise and
foolish  rich and poor  will unite in an ineffable fraternity  and 
singing in unison a new hymn  will rebuild thy altar  o god of liberty
and equality

second memoir 


paris  april 1  1841 

monsieur   

before resuming my  inquiries into government and property   it is
fitting  for the satisfaction of some worthy people  and also in the
interest of order  that i should make to you a plain  straightforward
explanation  in a much governed state  no one would be allowed to
attack the external form of the society  and the groundwork of its
institutions  until he had established his right to do so   first  by
his morality  second  by his capacity  and  third  by the purity of
his intentions  any one who  wishing to publish a treatise upon the
constitution of the country  could not satisfy this threefold condition 
would be obliged to procure the endorsement of a responsible patron
possessing the requisite qualifications 

but we frenchmen have the liberty of the press  this grand right  the
sword of thought  which elevates the virtuous citizen to the rank of
legislator  and makes the malicious citizen an agent of discord  frees
us from all preliminary responsibility to the law  but it does not
release us from our internal obligation to render a public account
of our sentiments and thoughts  i have used  in all its fulness  and
concerning an important question  the right which the charter grants
us  i come to day  sir  to submit my conscience to your judgment  and my
feeble insight to your discriminating reason  you have criticised in a
kindly spirit  i had almost said with partiality for the writer  a work
which teaches a doctrine that you thought it your duty to condemn   the
academy of moral and political sciences   said you in your report   can
accept the conclusions of the author only as far as it likes   i venture
to hope  sir  that  after you have read this letter  if your prudence
still restrains you  your fairness will induce you to do me justice 

men  equal in the dignity of their persons and equal before the law 
should be equal in their conditions   such is the thesis which i
maintained and developed in a memoir bearing the title   what is
property  or  an inquiry into the principle of right and of government  

the idea of social equality  even in individual fortunes  has in all
ages besieged  like a vague presentiment  the human imagination  poets
have sung of it in their hymns  philosophers have dreamed of it in their
utopias  priests teach it  but only for the spiritual world  the people 
governed by it  never have had faith in it  and the civil power is never
more disturbed than by the fables of the age of gold and the reign
of astrea  a year ago  however  this idea received a scientific
demonstration  which has not yet been satisfactorily answered  and 
permit me to add  never will be  this demonstration  owing to its
slightly impassioned style  its method of reasoning   which was so
at variance with that employed by the generally recognized
authorities   and the importance and novelty of its conclusions  was of
a nature to cause some alarm  and might have been dangerous  had it not
been  as you  sir  so well said  a sealed letter  so far as the general
public was concerned  addressed only to men of intelligence  i was
glad to see that through its metaphysical dress you recognized the wise
foresight of the author  and i thank you for it  may god grant that my
intentions  which are wholly peaceful  may never be charged upon me as
treasonable 

like a stone thrown into a mass of serpents  the first memoir on
property excited intense animosity  and aroused the passions of many 
but  while some wished the author and his work to be publicly denounced 
others found in them simply the solution of the fundamental problems of
society  a few even basing evil speculations upon the new light which
they had obtained  it was not to be expected that a system of inductions
abstractly gathered together  and still more abstractly expressed  would
be understood with equal accuracy in its ensemble and in each of its
parts 

to find the law of equality  no longer in charity and self sacrifice
 which are not binding in their nature   but in justice  to base
equality of functions upon equality of persons  to determine the
absolute principle of exchange  to neutralize the inequality of
individual faculties by collective force  to establish an equation
between property and robbery  to change the law of succession without
destroying the principle  to maintain the human personality in a
system of absolute association  and to save liberty from the chains
of communism  to synthetize the monarchical and democratic forms of
government  to reverse the division of powers  to give the executive
power to the nation  and to make legislation a positive  fixed 
and absolute science   what a series of paradoxes  what a string of
delusions  if i may not say  what a chain of truths  but it is not
my purpose here to pass upon the theory of the right of possession  i
discuss no dogmas  my only object is to justify my views  and to show
that  in writing as i did  i not only exercised a right  but performed a
duty 

yes  i have attacked property  and shall attack it again  but  sir 
before demanding that i shall make the amende honorable for having
obeyed my conscience and spoken the exact truth  condescend  i beg of
you  to cast a glance at the events which are happening around us  look
at our deputies  our magistrates  our philosophers  our ministers  our
professors  and our publicists  examine their methods of dealing with
the matter of property  count up with me the restrictions placed upon
it every day in the name of the public welfare  measure the breaches
already made  estimate those which society thinks of making hereafter 
add the ideas concerning property held by all theories in common 
interrogate history  and then tell me what will be left  half a century
hence  of this old right of property  and  thus perceiving that i have
so many accomplices  you will immediately declare me innocent 

what is the law of expropriation on the ground of public utility  which
everybody favors  and which is even thought too lenient   36 


a flagrant violation of the right of property  society indemnifies 
it is said  the dispossessed proprietor  but does it return to him the
traditional associations  the poetic charm  and the family pride which
accompany property  naboth  and the miller of sans souci  would have
protested against french law  as they protested against the caprice of
their kings   it is the field of our fathers   they would have cried 
 and we will not sell it   among the ancients  the refusal of the
individual limited the powers of the state  the roman law bowed to
the will of the citizen  and an emperor  commodus  if i remember
rightly  abandoned the project of enlarging the forum out of respect for
the rights of the occupants who refused to abdicate  property is a
real right   jus   in re    a right inherent in the thing  and whose
principle lies in the external manifestation of man s will  man leaves
his imprint  stamps his character  upon the objects of his handiwork 
this plastic force of man  as the modern jurists say  is the seal which 
set upon matter  makes it holy  whoever lays hands upon it  against the
proprietor s will  does violence to the latter s personality  and yet 
when an administrative committee saw fit to declare that public utility
required it  property had to give way to the general will  soon  in
the name of public utility  methods of cultivation and conditions of
enjoyment will be prescribed  inspectors of agriculture and manufactures
will be appointed  property will be taken away from unskilful hands 
and entrusted to laborers who are more deserving of it  and a general
superintendence of production will be established  it is not two years
since i saw a proprietor destroy a forest more than five hundred acres
in extent  if public utility had interfered  that forest  the only one
for miles around  would still be standing 

but  it is said  expropriation on the ground of public utility is only
an exception which confirms the principle  and bears testimony in
favor of the right  very well  but from this exception we will pass to
another  from that to a third  and so on from exceptions to exceptions 
until we have reduced the rule to a pure abstraction 

how many supporters do you think  sir  can be claimed for the project
of the conversion of the public funds  i venture to say that everybody
favors it  except the fund holders  now  this so called conversion is
an extensive expropriation  and in this case with no indemnity whatever 
the public funds are so much real estate  the income from which the
proprietor counts upon with perfect safety  and which owes its value
to the tacit promise of the government to pay interest upon it at the
established rate  until the fund holder applies for redemption  for 
if the income is liable to diminution  it is less profitable than
house rent or farm rent  whose rates may rise or fall according to the
fluctuations in the market  and in that case  what inducement has the
capitalist to invest his money in the state  when  then  you force the
fund holder to submit to a diminution of interest  you make him bankrupt
to the extent of the diminution  and since  in consequence of the
conversion  an equally profitable investment becomes impossible  you
depreciate his property 

that such a measure may be justly executed  it must be generalized  that
is  the law which provides for it must decree also that interest on sums
lent on deposit or on mortgage throughout the realm  as well as house
and farm rents  shall be reduced to three per cent  this simultaneous
reduction of all kinds of income would be not a whit more difficult to
accomplish than the proposed conversion  and  further  it would offer
the advantage of forestalling at one blow all objections to it  at the
same time that it would insure a just assessment of the land tax  see 
if at the moment of conversion a piece of real estate yields an income
of one thousand francs  after the new law takes effect it will yield
only six hundred francs  now  allowing the tax to be an aliquot
part  one fourth for example  of the income derived from each piece of
property  it is clear on the one hand that the proprietor would not  in
order to lighten his share of the tax  underestimate the value of his
property  since  house and farm rents being fixed by the value of the
capital  and the latter being measured by the tax  to depreciate his
real estate would be to reduce his revenue  on the other hand  it is
equally evident that the same proprietors could not overestimate the
value of their property  in order to increase their incomes beyond the
limits of the law  since the tenants and farmers  with their old leases
in their hands  would enter a protest 

such  sir  must be the result sooner or later of the conversion which
has been so long demanded  otherwise  the financial operation of which
we are speaking would be a crying injustice  unless intended as a
stepping stone  this last motive seems the most plausible one  for in
spite of the clamors of interested parties  and the flagrant violation
of certain rights  the public conscience is bound to fulfil its desire 
and is no more affected when charged with attacking property  than
when listening to the complaints of the bondholders  in this case 
instinctive justice belies legal justice 

who has not heard of the inextricable confusion into which the chamber
of deputies was thrown last year  while discussing the question of
colonial and native sugars  did they leave these two industries to
themselves  the native manufacturer was ruined by the colonist  to
maintain the beet root  the cane had to be taxed  to protect the
property of the one  it became necessary to violate the property of the
other  the most remarkable feature of this business was precisely that
to which the least attention was paid  namely  that  in one way or
another  property had to be violated  did they impose on each industry
a proportional tax  so as to preserve a balance in the market  they
created a maximum price for each variety of sugar  and  as this maximum
price was not the same  they attacked property in two ways   on the one
hand  interfering with the liberty of trade  on the other  disregarding
the equality of proprietors  did they suppress the beet root by granting
an indemnity to the manufacturer  they sacrificed the property of the
tax payer  finally  did they prefer to cultivate the two varieties of
sugar at the nation s expense  just as different varieties of tobacco
are cultivated  they abolished  so far as the sugar industry was
concerned  the right of property  this last course  being the most
social  would have been certainly the best  but  if property is the
necessary basis of civilization  how is this deep seated antagonism to
be explained   37 


not satisfied with the power of dispossessing a citizen on the ground
of public utility  they want also to dispossess him on the ground of
private utility  for a long time  a revision of the law concerning
mortgages was clamored for  a process was demanded  in behalf of all
kinds of credit and in the interest of even the debtors themselves 
which would render the expropriation of real estate as prompt  as easy 
and as effective as that which follows a commercial protest  the chamber
of deputies  in the early part of this year  1841  discussed this
project  and the law was passed almost unanimously  there is nothing
more just  nothing more reasonable  nothing more philosophical
apparently  than the motives which gave rise to this reform 

i  formerly  the small proprietor whose obligation had arrived at
maturity  and who found himself unable to meet it  had to employ all
that he had left  after being released from his debt  in defraying the
legal costs  henceforth  the promptness of expropriation will save him
from total ruin  2  the difficulties in the way of payment arrested
credit  and prevented the employment of capital in agricultural
enterprises  this cause of distrust no longer existing  capitalists will
find new markets  agriculture will rapidly develop  and farmers will
be the first to enjoy the benefit of the new law  3  finally  it was
iniquitous and absurd  that  on account of a protested note  a poor
manufacturer should see in twenty four hours his business arrested  his
labor suspended  his merchandise seized  his machinery sold at auction 
and finally himself led off to prison  while two years were sometimes
necessary to expropriate the most miserable piece of real estate 

these arguments  and others besides  you clearly stated  sir  in your
first lectures of this academic year 

but  when stating these excellent arguments  did you ask yourself  sir 
whither would tend such a transformation of our system of mortgages    
to monetize  if i may say so  landed property  to accumulate it within
portfolios  to separate the laborer from the soil  man from nature  to
make him a wanderer over the face of the earth  to eradicate from
his heart every trace of family feeling  national pride  and love of
country  to isolate him more and more  to render him indifferent to
all around him  to concentrate his love upon one object   money  and 
finally  by the dishonest practices of usury  to monopolize the land
to the profit of a financial aristocracy   a worthy auxiliary of that
industrial feudality whose pernicious influence we begin to feel so
bitterly  thus  little by little  the subordination of the laborer to
the idler  the restoration of abolished castes  and the distinction
between patrician and plebeian  would be effected  thus  thanks to the
new privileges granted to the property of the capitalists  that of the
small and intermediate proprietors would gradually disappear  and with
it the whole class of free and honest laborers  this certainly is not
my plan for the abolition of property  far from mobilizing the soil  i
would  if possible  immobilize even the functions of pure intelligence 
so that society might be the fulfilment of the intentions of nature 
who gave us our first possession  the land  for  if the instrument
or capital of production is the mark of the laborer  it is also his
pedestal  his support  his country  and  as the psalmist says  the place
of his activity and his rest   38 


let us examine more closely still the inevitable and approaching result
of the last law concerning judicial sales and mortgages  under
the system of competition which is killing us  and whose necessary
expression is a plundering and tyrannical government  the farmer will
need always capital in order to repair his losses  and will be forced to
contract loans  always depending upon the future for the payment of his
debts  he will be deceived in his hope  and surprised by maturity  for
what is there more prompt  more unexpected  more abbreviatory of space
and time  than the maturity of an obligation  i address this question
to all whom this pitiless nemesis pursues  and even troubles in their
dreams  now  under the new law  the expropriation of a debtor will be
effected a hundred times more rapidly  then  also  spoliation will be
a hundred times surer  and the free laborer will pass a hundred times
sooner from his present condition to that of a serf attached to the
soil  formerly  the length of time required to effect the seizure
curbed the usurer s avidity  gave the borrower an opportunity to recover
himself  and gave rise to a transaction between him and his creditor
which might result finally in a complete release  now  the debtor s
sentence is irrevocable  he has but a few days of grace 

and what advantages are promised by this law as an offset to this sword
of damocles  suspended by a single hair over the head of the unfortunate
husbandman  the expenses of seizure will be much less  it is said  but
will the interest on the borrowed capital be less exorbitant  for  after
all  it is interest which impoverishes the peasant and leads to his
expropriation  that the law may be in harmony with its principle  that
it may be truly inspired by that spirit of justice for which it is
commended  it must  while facilitating expropriation  lower the legal
price of money  otherwise  the reform concerning mortgages is but a trap
set for small proprietors   a legislative trick 

lower interest on money  but  as we have just seen  that is to limit
property  here  sir  you shall make your own defence  more than once  in
your learned lectures  i have heard you deplore the precipitancy of the
chambers  who  without previous study and without profound knowledge
of the subject  voted almost unanimously to maintain the statutes and
privileges of the bank  now these privileges  these statutes  this vote
of the chambers  mean simply this   that the market price of specie 
at five or six per cent   is not too high  and that the conditions
of exchange  discount  and circulation  which generally double this
interest  are none too severe  so the government thinks  m  blanqui  a
professor of political economy  paid by the state  maintains the
contrary  and pretends to demonstrate  by decisive arguments  the
necessity of a reform  who  then  best understands the interests of
property   the state  or m  blanqui 

if specie could be borrowed at half the present rate  the revenues from
all sorts of property would soon be reduced one half also  for example 
when it costs less to build a house than to hire one  when it is cheaper
to clear a field than to procure one already cleared  competition
inevitably leads to a reduction of house and farm rents  since the
surest way to depreciate active capital is to increase its amount  but
it is a law of political economy that an increase of production augments
the mass of available capital  consequently tends to raise wages  and
finally to annihilate interest  then  proprietors are interested in
maintaining the statutes and privileges of the bank  then  a reform in
this matter would compromise the right of increase  then  the peers and
deputies are better informed than professor blanqui 

but these same deputies   so jealous of their privileges whenever
the equalizing effects of a reform are within their intellectual
horizon   what did they do a few days before they passed the law
concerning judicial sales  they formed a conspiracy against property 
their law to regulate the labor of children in factories will  without
doubt  prevent the manufacturer from compelling a child to labor more
than so many hours a day  but it will not force him to increase the pay
of the child  nor that of its father  to day  in the interest of health 
we diminish the subsistence of the poor  to morrow it will be necessary
to protect them by fixing their minimum wages  but to fix their minimum
wages is to compel the proprietor  is to force the master to accept his
workman as an associate  which interferes with freedom and makes mutual
insurance obligatory  once entered upon this path  we never shall
stop  little by little the government will become manufacturer 
commission merchant  and retail dealer 

it will be the sole proprietor  why  at all epochs  have the ministers
of state been so reluctant to meddle with the question of wages 
why have they always refused to interfere between the master and the
workman  because they knew the touchy and jealous nature of property 
and  regarding it as the principle of all civilization  felt that to
meddle with it would be to unsettle the very foundations of society 
sad condition of the proprietary regime   one of inability to exercise
charity without violating justice   39 


and  sir  this fatal consequence which necessity forces upon the state
is no mere imagination  even now the legislative power is asked  no
longer simply to regulate the government of factories  but to create
factories itself  listen to the millions of voices shouting on all hands
for the organisation of labor  the creation of national workshops 
the whole laboring class is agitated  it has its journals  organs 
and representatives  to guarantee labor to the workingman  to balance
production with sale  to harmonize industrial proprietors  it advocates
to day  as a sovereign remedy  one sole head  one national wardenship 
one huge manufacturing company  for  sir  all this is included in the
idea of national workshops  on this subject i wish to quote  as proof 
the views of an illustrious economist  a brilliant mind  a progressive
intellect  an enthusiastic soul  a true patriot  and yet an official
defender of the right of property   40 


the honorable professor of the conservatory proposes then   

1  to check the continual emigration of laborers from the country into
the cities 

but  to keep the peasant in his village  his residence there must be
made endurable  to be just to all  the proletaire of the country must be
treated as well as the proletaire of the city  reform is needed  then 
on farms as well as in factories  and  when the government enters the
workshop  the government must seize the plough  what becomes  during
this progressive invasion  of independent cultivation  exclusive domain 
property 

2  to fix for each profession a moderate salary  varying with time and
place and based upon certain data 

the object of this measure would be to secure to laborers their
subsistence  and to proprietors their profits  while obliging the latter
to sacrifice from motives of prudence  if for no other reason  a portion
of their income  now  i say  that this portion  in the long run  would
swell until at last there would be an equality of enjoyment between the
proletaire and the proprietor  for  as we have had occasion to remark
several times already  the interest of the capitalist  in other words
the increase of the idler  tends  on account of the power of labor  the
multiplication of products and exchanges  to continually diminish  and 
by constant reduction  to disappear  so that  in the society proposed
by m  blanqui  equality would not be realized at first  but would exist
potentially  since property  though outwardly seeming to be industrial
feudality  being no longer a principle of exclusion and encroachment 
but only a privilege of division  would not be slow  thanks to the
intellectual and political emancipation of the proletariat  in passing
into absolute equality   as absolute at least as any thing can be on
this earth 

i omit  for the sake of brevity  the numerous considerations which
the professor adduces in support of what he calls  too modestly in my
opinion  his utopia  they would serve only to prove beyond all question
that  of all the charlatans of radicalism who fatigue the public ear 
no one approaches  for depth and clearness of thought  the audacious m 
blanqui 


3  national workshops should be in operation only during periods of
stagnation in ordinary industries  at such times they should be opened
as vast outlets to the flood of the laboring population 

but  sir  the stoppage of private industry is the result of
over production  and insufficient markets  if  then  production
continues in the national workshops  how will the crisis be terminated 
undoubtedly  by the general depreciation of merchandise  and  in the
last analysis  by the conversion of private workshops into national
workshops  on the other hand  the government will need capital with
which to pay its workmen  now  how will this capital be obtained  by
taxation  and upon what will the tax be levied  upon property  then you
will have proprietary industry sustaining against itself  and at its own
expense  another industry with which it cannot compete  what  think you 
will become  in this fatal circle  of the possibility of profit   in a
word  of property 

thank heaven  equality of conditions is taught in the public schools 
let us fear revolutions no longer  the most implacable enemy of property
could not  if he wished to destroy it  go to work in a wiser and more
effective way  courage  then  ministers  deputies  economists  make
haste to seize this glorious initiative  let the watchwords of equality 
uttered from the heights of science and power  be repeated in the midst
of the people  let them thrill the breasts of the proletaires  and carry
dismay into the ranks of the last representatives of privilege 

the tendency of society in favor of compelling proprietors to support
national workshops and public manufactories is so strong that for
several years  under the name of electoral reform  it has been
exclusively the question of the day  what is  after all  this electoral
reform which the people grasp at  as if it were a bait  and which
so many ambitious persons either call for or denounce  it is the
acknowledgment of the right of the masses to a voice in the assessment
of taxes  and the making of the laws  which laws  aiming always at the
protection of material interests  affect  in a greater or less degree 
all questions of taxation or wages  now the people  instructed long
since by their journals  their dramas   41  and their songs   42  know
to day that taxation  to be equitably divided  must be graduated  and
must be borne mainly by the rich   that it must be levied upon luxuries 
&c  and be sure that the people  once in the majority in the chamber 
will not fail to apply these lessons  already we have a minister
of public works  national workshops will follow  and soon  as
a consequence  the excess of the proprietor s revenue over the
workingman s wages will be swallowed up in the coffers of the laborers
of the state  do you not see that in this way property is gradually
reduced  as nobility was formerly  to a nominal title  to a distinction
purely honorary in its nature 


either the electoral reform will fail to accomplish that which is hoped
from it  and will disappoint its innumerable partisans  or else it will
inevitably result in a transformation of the absolute right under which
we live into a right of possession  that is  that while  at present 
property makes the elector  after this reform is accomplished  the
citizen  the producer will be the possessor   43  consequently  the
radicals are right in saying that the electoral reform is in their eyes
only a means  but  when they are silent as to the end  they show either
profound ignorance  or useless dissimulation  there should be no secrets
or reservations from peoples and powers  he disgraces himself and fails
in respect for his fellows  who  in publishing his opinions  employs
evasion and cunning  before the people act  they need to know the whole
truth  unhappy he who shall dare to trifle with them  for the people are
credulous  but they are strong  let us tell them  then  that this reform
which is proposed is only a means   a means often tried  and hitherto
without effect   but that the logical object of the electoral reform is
equality of fortunes  and that this equality itself is only a new means
having in view the superior and definitive object of the salvation of
society  the restoration of morals and religion  and the revival of
poetry and art 


this assertion of m  rossi is not borne out by history  property is the
cause of the electoral right  not as a presumption of capacity   an idea
which never prevailed until lately  and which is extremely absurd   but
as a guarantee of devotion to the established order  the electoral body
is a league of those interested in the maintenance of property  against
those not interested  there are thousands of documents  even official
documents  to prove this  if necessary  for the rest  the present system
is only a continuation of the municipal system  which  in the
middle ages  sprang up in connection with feudalism   an oppressive 
mischief making system  full of petty passions and base intrigues 


it would be an abuse of the reader s patience to insist further upon
the tendency of our time towards equality  there are  moreover  so many
people who denounce the present age  that nothing is gained by exposing
to their view the popular  scientific  and representative tendencies of
the nation 

prompt to recognize the accuracy of the inferences drawn from
observation  they confine themselves to a general censure of the facts 
and an absolute denial of their legitimacy   what wonder   they say 
 that this atmosphere of equality intoxicates us  considering all that
has been said and done during the past ten years     do you not see that
society is dissolving  that a spirit of infatuation is carrying us away 
all these hopes of regeneration are but forebodings of death  your songs
of triumph are like the prayers of the departing  your trumpet peals
announce the baptism of a dying man  civilization is falling in ruin 
 imus  imus  praecipites   

such people deny god  i might content myself with the reply that
the spirit of 1830 was the result of the maintenance of the violated
charter  that this charter arose from the revolution of  89  that
 89 implies the states general s right of remonstrance  and the
enfranchisement of the communes  that the communes suppose feudalism 
which in its turn supposes invasion  roman law  christianity  &c 

but it is necessary to look further  we must penetrate to the very heart
of ancient institutions  plunge into the social depths  and uncover this
indestructible leaven of equality which the god of justice breathed into
our souls  and which manifests itself in all our works 

labor is man s contemporary  it is a duty  since it is a condition of
existence   in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread   it is more
than a duty  it is a mission   god put the man into the garden to dress
it   i add that labor is the cause and means of equality 

cast away upon a desert island two men  one large  strong  and active 
the other weak  timid  and domestic  the latter will die of hunger 
while the other  a skilful hunter  an expert fisherman  and an
indefatigable husbandman  will overstock himself with provisions  what
greater inequality  in this state of nature so dear to the heart of jean
jacques  could be imagined  but let these two men meet and associate
themselves  the second immediately attends to the cooking  takes charge
of the household affairs  and sees to the provisions  beds  and clothes 
provided the stronger does not abuse his superiority by enslaving and
ill treating his companion  their social condition will be perfectly
equal  thus  through exchange of services  the inequalities of nature
neutralize each other  talents associate  and forces balance  violence
and inertia are found only among the poor and the aristocratic  and
in that lies the philosophy of political economy  the mystery of human
brotherhood   hic est sapientia   let us pass from the hypothetical
state of pure nature into civilization 

the proprietor of the soil  who produces  i will suppose with the
economists  by lending his instrument  receives at the foundation of a
society so many bushels of grain for each acre of arable land  as long
as labor is weak  and the variety of its products small  the proprietor
is powerful in comparison with the laborers  he has ten times 
one hundred times  the portion of an honest man  but let labor  by
multiplying its inventions  multiply its enjoyments and wants  and the
proprietor  if he wishes to enjoy the new products  will be obliged to
reduce his income every day  and since the first products tend rather
to depreciate than to rise in value   in consequence of the continual
addition of the new ones  which may be regarded as supplements of the
first ones   it follows that the idle proprietor grows poor as fast
as public prosperity increases   incomes   i like to quote you  sir 
because it is impossible to give too good an authority for these
elementary principles of economy  and because i cannot express them
better myself    incomes   you have said   tend to disappear as capital
increases  he who possesses to day an income of twenty thousand pounds
is not nearly as rich as he who possessed the same amount fifty years
ago  the time is coming when all property will be a burden to the idle 
and will necessarily pass into the hands of the able and industrious 
 44     


in order to live as a proprietor  or to consume without producing  it is
necessary  then  to live upon the labor of another  in other words 
it is necessary to kill the laborer  it is upon this principle that
proprietors of those varieties of capital which are of primary necessity
increase their farm rents as fast as industry develops  much more
careful of their privileges in that respect  than those economists who 
in order to strengthen property  advocate a reduction of interest 
but the crime is unavailing  labor and production increase  soon the
proprietor will be forced to labor  and then property is lost 

the proprietor is a man who  having absolute control of an instrument
of production  claims the right to enjoy the product of the instrument
without using it himself  to this end he lends it  and we have just
seen that from this loan the laborer derives a power of exchange  which
sooner or later will destroy the right of increase  in the first place 
the proprietor is obliged to allow the laborer a portion of the product 
for without it the laborer could not live  soon the latter  through
the development of his industry  finds a means of regaining the greater
portion of that which he gives to the proprietor  so that at last  the
objects of enjoyment increasing continually  while the income of the
idler remains the same  the proprietor  having exhausted his resources 
begins to think of going to work himself  then the victory of the
producer is certain  labor commences to tip the balance towards its own
side  and commerce leads to equilibrium 

man s instinct cannot err  as  in liberty  exchange of functions leads
inevitably to equality among men  so commerce  or exchange of products 
which is identical with exchange of functions  is a new cause of
equality  as long as the proprietor does not labor  however small his
income  he enjoys a privilege  the laborer s welfare may be equal to
his  but equality of conditions does not exist  but as soon as the
proprietor becomes a producer   since he can exchange his special
product only with his tenant or his  commandite    sooner or later this
tenant  this  exploited  man  if violence is not done him  will make
a profit out of the proprietor  and will oblige him to restore  in the
exchange of their respective products  the interest on his capital  so
that  balancing one injustice by another  the contracting parties will
be equal  labor and exchange  when liberty prevails  lead  then  to
equality of fortunes  mutuality of services neutralizes privilege 
that is why despots in all ages and countries have assumed control
of commerce  they wished to prevent the labor of their subjects from
becoming an obstacle to the rapacity of tyrants 

up to this point  all takes place in the natural order  there is no
premeditation  no artifice  the whole proceeding is governed by the laws
of necessity alone  proprietors and laborers act only in obedience to
their wants  thus  the exercise of the right of increase  the art
of robbing the producer  depends  during this first period of
civilization  upon physical violence  murder  and war 

but at this point a gigantic and complicated conspiracy is hatched
against the capitalists  the weapon of the exploiters is met by the
exploited with the instrument of commerce   a marvellous invention 
denounced at its origin by the moralists who favored property  but
inspired without doubt by the genius of labor  by the minerva of the
proletaires 

the principal cause of the evil lay in the accumulation and immobility
of capital of all sorts   an immobility which prevented labor  enslaved
and subalternized by haughty idleness  from ever acquiring it  the
necessity was felt of dividing and mobilizing wealth  of rendering it
portable  of making it pass from the hands of the possessor into those
of the worker  labor invented money  afterwards  this invention was
revived and developed by the bill of exchange and the bank  for all
these things are substantially the same  and proceed from the same mind 
the first man who conceived the idea of representing a value by a shell 
a precious stone  or a certain weight of metal  was the real inventor
of the bank  what is a piece of money  in fact  it is a bill of exchange
written upon solid and durable material  and carrying with it its own
redemption  by this means  oppressed equality was enabled to laugh at
the efforts of the proprietors  and the balance of justice was adjusted
for the first time in the tradesman s shop  the trap was cunningly set 
and accomplished its purpose so thoroughly that in idle hands money
became only dissolving wealth  a false symbol  a shadow of riches  an
excellent economist and profound philosopher was that miser who took
as his motto   when a guinea is exchanged  it evaporates   so it may
be said   when real estate is converted into money  it is lost   this
explains the constant fact of history  that the nobles  the unproductive
proprietors of the soil  have every where been dispossessed by
industrial and commercial plebeians  such was especially the case in the
formation of the italian republics  born  during the middle ages  of
the impoverishment of the seigniors  i will not pursue the interesting
considerations which this matter suggests  i could only repeat the
testimony of historians  and present economical demonstrations in an
altered form 

the greatest enemy of the landed and industrial aristocracy to day  the
incessant promoter of equality of fortunes  is the banker  through him
immense plains are divided  mountains change their positions  forests
are grown upon the public squares  one hemisphere produces for another 
and every corner of the globe has its usufructuaries  by means of the
bank new wealth is continually created  the use of which  soon becoming
indispensable to selfishness  wrests the dormant capital from the hands
of the jealous proprietor  the banker is at once the most potent creator
of wealth  and the main distributor of the products of art and nature 
and yet  by the strangest antinomy  this same banker is the most
relentless collector of profits  increase  and usury ever inspired by
the demon of property  the importance of the services which he renders
leads us to endure  though not without complaint  the taxes which he
imposes  nevertheless  since nothing can avoid its providential mission 
since nothing which exists can escape the end for which it exists
the banker  the modern croesus  must some day become the restorer of
equality  and following in your footsteps  sir  i have already given the
reason  namely  that profit decreases as capital multiplies  since an
increase of capital  calling for more laborers  without whom it remains
unproductive  always causes an increase of wages  whence it follows that
the bank  to day the suction pump of wealth  is destined to become the
steward of the human race 

the phrase equality of fortunes chafes people  as if it referred to
a condition of the other world  unknown here below  there are some
persons  radicals as well as moderates  whom the very mention of this
idea fills with indignation  let  then  these silly aristocrats abolish
mercantile societies and insurance companies  which are founded
by prudence for mutual assistance  for all these social facts  so
spontaneous and free from all levelling intentions  are the legitimate
fruits of the instinct of equality 

when the legislator makes a law  properly speaking he does not make
it   he does not create it  he describes it  in legislating upon the
moral  civil  and political relations of citizens  he does not express
an arbitrary notion  he states the general idea   the higher principle
which governs the matter which he is considering  in a word  he is the
proclaimer  not the inventor  of the law  so  when two or more men
form among themselves  by synallagmatic contract  an industrial or an
insurance association  they recognize that their interests  formerly
isolated by a false spirit of selfishness and independence  are
firmly connected by their inner natures  and by the mutuality of their
relations  they do not really bind themselves by an act of their private
will  they swear to conform henceforth to a previously existing social
law hitherto disregarded by them  and this is proved by the fact that
these same men  could they avoid association  would not associate 
before they can be induced to unite their interests  they must acquire
full knowledge of the dangers of competition and isolation  hence the
experience of evil is the only thing which leads them into society 

now i say that  to establish equality among men  it is only necessary
to generalize the principle upon which insurance  agricultural  and
commercial associations are based  i say that competition  isolation
of interests  monopoly  privilege  accumulation of capital  exclusive
enjoyment  subordination of functions  individual production  the right
of profit or increase  the exploitation of man by man  and  to sum up
all these species under one head  that property is the principal cause
of misery and crime  and  for having arrived at this offensive and
anti proprietary conclusion  i am an abhorred monster  radicals and
conservatives alike point me out as a fit subject for prosecution  the
academies shower their censures upon me  the most worthy people regard
me as mad  and those are excessively tolerant who content themselves
with the assertion that i am a fool  oh  unhappy the writer who
publishes the truth otherwise than as a performance of a duty  if he has
counted upon the applause of the crowd  if he has supposed that avarice
and self interest would forget themselves in admiration of him  if he
has neglected to encase himself within three thicknesses of brass   he
will fail  as he ought  in his selfish undertaking  the unjust
criticisms  the sad disappointments  the despair of his mistaken
ambition  will kill him 

but  if i am no longer permitted to express my own personal opinion
concerning this interesting question of social equilibrium  let me  at
least  make known the thought of my masters  and develop the doctrines
advocated in the name of the government 

it never has been my intention  sir  in spite of the vigorous censure
which you  in behalf of your academy  have pronounced upon the doctrine
of equality of fortunes  to contradict and cope with you  in listening
to you  i have felt my inferiority too keenly to permit me to enter upon
such a discussion  and then   if it must be said   however different
your language is from mine  we believe in the same principles  you share
all my opinions  i do not mean to insinuate thereby  sir  that you have
 to use the phraseology of the schools  an esoteric and an exoteric
doctrine   that  secretly believing in equality  you defend property
only from motives of prudence and by command  i am not rash enough to
regard you as my colleague in my revolutionary projects  and i esteem
you too highly  moreover  to suspect you of dissimulation  i only
mean that the truths which methodical investigation and laborious
metaphysical speculation have painfully demonstrated to me  a profound
acquaintance with political economy and a long experience reveal to
you  while i have reached my belief in equality by long reflection  and
almost in spite of my desires  you hold yours  sir  with all the zeal of
faith   with all the spontaneity of genius  that is why your course
of lectures at the conservatory is a perpetual war upon property and
inequality of fortunes  that is why your most learned investigations 
your most ingenious analyses  and your innumerable observations always
conclude in a formula of progress and equality  that is why  finally 
you are never more admired and applauded than at those moments of
inspiration when  borne upon the wings of science  you ascend to those
lofty truths which cause plebeian hearts to beat with enthusiasm  and
which chill with horror men whose intentions are evil  how many times 
from the place where i eagerly drank in your eloquent words  have i
inwardly thanked heaven for exempting you from the judgment passed by
st  paul upon the philosophers of his time    they have known the truth 
and have not made it known   how many times have i rejoiced at finding
my own justification in each of your discourses  no  no  i neither wish
nor ask for any thing which you do not teach yourself  i appeal to your
numerous audience  let it belie me if  in commenting upon you  i pervert
your meaning 

a disciple of say  what in your eyes is more anti social than the
custom houses  or  as you correctly call them  the barriers erected by
monopoly between nations  what is more annoying  more unjust  or more
absurd  than this prohibitory system which compels us to pay forty
sous in france for that which in england or belgium would bring us but
fifteen  it is the custom house  you once said   45  which arrests
the development of civilization by preventing the specialization of
industries  it is the custom house which enriches a hundred monopolists
by impoverishing millions of citizens  it is the custom house which
produces famine in the midst of abundance  which makes labor sterile by
prohibiting exchange  and which stifles production in a mortal embrace 
it is the custom house which renders nations jealous of  and hostile to 
each other  four fifths of the wars of all ages were caused originally
by the custom house  and then  at the highest pitch of your enthusiasm 
you shouted   yes  if to put an end to this hateful system  it should
become necessary for me to shed the last drop of my blood  i would
joyfully spring into the gap  asking only time enough to give thanks to
god for having judged me worthy of martyrdom  


and  at that solemn moment  i said to myself   place in every department
of france such a professor as that  and the revolution is avoided  

but  sir  by this magnificent theory of liberty of commerce you render
military glory impossible   you leave nothing for diplomacy to do 
you even take away the desire for conquest  while abolishing profit
altogether  what matters it  indeed  who restores constantinople 
alexandria  and saint jean d acre  if the syrians  egyptians  and turks
are free to choose their masters  free to exchange their products with
whom they please  why should europe get into such a turmoil over this
petty sultan and his old pasha  if it is only a question whether we or
the english shall civilize the orient   shall instruct egypt and syria
in the european arts  and shall teach them to construct machines  dig
canals  and build railroads  for  if to national independence free trade
is added  the foreign influence of these two countries is thereafter
exerted only through a voluntary relationship of producer to producer 
or apprentice to journeyman 

alone among european powers  france cheerfully accepted the task of
civilizing the orient  and began an invasion which was quite apostolic
in its character   so joyful and high minded do noble thoughts render
our nation  but diplomatic rivalry  national selfishness  english
avarice  and russian ambition stood in her way  to consummate a
long meditated usurpation  it was necessary to crush a too generous
ally  the robbers of the holy alliance formed a league against dauntless
and blameless france  consequently  at the news of this famous treaty 
there arose among us a chorus of curses upon the principle of property 
which at that time was acting under the hypocritical formulas of the old
political system  the last hour of property seemed to have struck by
the side of syria  from the alps to the ocean  from the rhine to the
pyrenees  the popular conscience was aroused  all france sang songs
of war  and the coalition turned pale at the sound of these shuddering
cries   war upon the autocrat  who wishes to be proprietor of the
old world  war upon the english perjurer  the devourer of india  the
poisoner of china  the tyrant of ireland  and the eternal enemy of
france  war upon the allies who have conspired against liberty and
equality  war  war  war upon property  

by the counsel of providence the emancipation of the nations is
postponed  france is to conquer  not by arms  but by example  universal
reason does not yet understand this grand equation  which  commencing
with the abolition of slavery  and advancing over the ruins of
aristocracies and thrones  must end in equality of rights and fortunes 
but the day is not far off when the knowledge of this truth will be as
common as that of equality of origin  already it seems to be understood
that the oriental question is only a question of custom houses  is it 
then  so difficult for public opinion to generalize this idea  and to
comprehend  finally  that if the suppression of custom houses involves
the abolition of national property  it involves also  as a consequence 
the abolition of individual property 

in fact  if we suppress the custom houses  the alliance of the nations
is declared by that very act  their solidarity is recognized  and their
equality proclaimed  if we suppress the custom houses  the principle of
association will not be slow in reaching from the state to the province 
from the province to the city  and from the city to the workshop  but 
then  what becomes of the privileges of authors and artists  of what
use are the patents for invention  imagination  amelioration  and
improvement  when our deputies write a law of literary property by
the side of a law which opens a large breach in the custom house they
contradict themselves  indeed  and pull down with one hand what they
build up with the other  without the custom house  literary property
does not exist  and the hopes of our starving authors are frustrated 
for  certainly you do not expect  with the good man fourier  that
literary property will exercise itself in china to the profit of a
french writer  and that an ode of lamartine  sold by privilege all over
the world  will bring in millions to its author  the poet s work
is peculiar to the climate in which he lives  every where else the
reproduction of his works  having no market value  should be frank and
free  but what  will it be necessary for nations to put themselves under
mutual surveillance for the sake of verses  statues  and elixirs  we
shall always have  then  an excise  a city toll  rights of entrance
and transit  custom houses finally  and then  as a reaction against
privilege  smuggling 

smuggling  that word reminds me of one of the most horrible forms
of property   smuggling   you have said  sir   46   is an offence of
political creation  it is the exercise of natural liberty  defined as a
crime in certain cases by the will of the sovereign  the smuggler is a
gallant man   a man of spirit  who gaily busies himself in procuring for
his neighbor  at a very low price  a jewel  a shawl  or any other object
of necessity or luxury  which domestic monopoly renders excessively
dear   then  to a very poetical monograph of the smuggler  you add this
dismal conclusion   that the smuggler belongs to the family of mandrin 
and that the galleys should be his home 


but  sir  you have not called attention to the horrible exploitation
which is carried on in this way in the name of property 

it is said   and i give this report only as an hypothesis and an
illustration  for i do not believe it   it is said that the present
minister of finances owes his fortune to smuggling  m  humann  of
strasbourg  sent out of france  it is said  enormous quantities of
sugar  for which he received the bounty on exportation promised by
the state  then  smuggling this sugar back again  he exported it anew 
receiving the bounty on exportation a second time  and so on  notice 
sir  that i do not state this as a fact  i give it only as it is told 
not endorsing or even believing it  my sole design is to fix the idea in
the mind by an example  if i believed that a minister had committed such
a crime  that is  if i had personal and authentic knowledge that he had 
i would denounce m  humann  the minister of finances  to the chamber of
deputies  and would loudly demand his expulsion from the ministry 

but that which is undoubtedly false of m  humann is true of many others 
as rich and no less honorable than he  smuggling  organized on a large
scale by the eaters of human flesh  is carried on to the profit of a few
pashas at the risk and peril of their imprudent victims  the inactive
proprietor offers his merchandise for sale  the actual smuggler risks
his liberty  his honor  and his life  if success crowns the enterprise 
the courageous servant gets paid for his journey  the profit goes to
the coward  if fortune or treachery delivers the instrument of this
execrable traffic into the hands of the custom house officer  the
master smuggler suffers a loss which a more fortunate voyage will soon
repair  the agent  pronounced a scoundrel  is thrown into prison in
company with robbers  while his glorious patron  a juror  elector 
deputy  or minister  makes laws concerning expropriation  monopoly  and
custom houses 

i promised  at the beginning of this letter  that no attack on property
should escape my pen  my only object being to justify myself before the
public by a general recrimination  but i could not refrain from branding
so odious a mode of exploitation  and i trust that this short digression
will be pardoned  property does not avenge  i hope  the injuries which
smuggling suffers 

the conspiracy against property is general  it is flagrant  it takes
possession of all minds  and inspires all our laws  it lies at the
bottom of all theories  here the proletaire pursues property in the
street  there the legislator lays an interdict upon it  now  a professor
of political economy or of industrial legislation   47  paid to defend
it  undermines it with redoubled blows  at another  time  an academy
calls it in question   48  or inquires as to the progress of its
demolition   49  to day there is not an idea  not an opinion  not
a sect  which does not dream of muzzling property  none confess it 
because none are yet conscious of it  there are too few minds capable
of grasping spontaneously this ensemble of causes and effects 
of principles and consequences  by which i try to demonstrate the
approaching disappearance of property  on the other hand  the ideas that
are generally formed of this right are too divergent and too loosely
determined to allow an admission  so soon  of the contrary theory  thus 
in the middle and lower ranks of literature and philosophy  no less than
among the common people  it is thought that  when property is abolished 
no one will be able to enjoy the fruit of his labor  that no one will
have any thing peculiar to himself  and that tyrannical communism will
be established on the ruins of family and liberty   chimeras  which are
to support for a little while longer the cause of privilege 


but  before determining precisely the idea of property  before seeking
amid the contradictions of systems for the common element which must
form the basis of the new right  let us cast a rapid glance at
the changes which  at the various periods of history  property has
undergone  the political forms of nations are the expression of their
beliefs  the mobility of these forms  their modification and their
destruction  are solemn experiences which show us the value of ideas 
and gradually eliminate from the infinite variety of customs the
absolute  eternal  and immutable truth  now  we shall see that every
political institution tends  necessarily  and on pain of death  to
equalize conditions  that every where and always equality of fortunes
 like equality of rights  has been the social aim  whether the plebeian
classes have endeavored to rise to political power by means of property 
or whether  rulers already  they have used political power to overthrow
property  we shall see  in short  by the progress of society  that the
consummation of justice lies in the extinction of individual domain 

for the sake of brevity  i will disregard the testimony of
ecclesiastical history and christian theology  this subject deserves a
separate treatise  and i propose hereafter to return to it  moses and
jesus christ proscribed  under the names of usury and inequality   50 
all sorts of profit and increase  the church itself  in its purest
teachings  has always condemned property  and when i attacked  not only
the authority of the church  but also its infidelity to justice  i did
it to the glory of religion  i wanted to provoke a peremptory reply  and
to pave the way for christianity s triumph  in spite of the innumerable
attacks of which it is at present the object  i hoped that an apologist
would arise forthwith  and  taking his stand upon the scriptures  the
fathers  the canons  and the councils and constitutions of the popes 
would demonstrate that the church always has maintained the doctrine of
equality  and would attribute to temporary necessity the contradictions
of its discipline  such a labor would serve the cause of religion
as well as that of equality  we must know  sooner or later  whether
christianity is to be regenerated in the church or out of it  and
whether this church accepts the reproaches cast upon it of hatred to
liberty and antipathy to progress  until then we will suspend judgment 
and content ourselves with placing before the clergy the teachings of
history 


when lycurgus undertook to make laws for sparta  in what condition did
he find this republic  on this point all historians agree  the people
and the nobles were at war  the city was in a confused state  and
divided by two parties   the party of the poor  and the party of the
rich  hardly escaped from the barbarism of the heroic ages  society was
rapidly declining  the proletariat made war upon property  which  in its
turn  oppressed the proletariat  what did lycurgus do  his first measure
was one of general security  at the very idea of which our legislators
would tremble  he abolished all debts  then  employing by turns
persuasion and force  he induced the nobles to renounce their
privileges  and re established equality 

lycurgus  in a word  hunted property out of lacedaemon  seeing no other
way to harmonize liberty  equality  and law  i certainly should not wish
france to follow the example of sparta  but it is remarkable that the
most ancient of greek legislators  thoroughly acquainted with the nature
and needs of the people  more capable than any one else of appreciating
the legitimacy of the obligations which he  in the exercise of his
absolute authority  cancelled  who had compared the legislative
systems of his time  and whose wisdom an oracle had proclaimed   it
is remarkable  i say  that lycurgus should have judged the right of
property incompatible with free institutions  and should have thought it
his duty to preface his legislation by a coup d etat which destroyed all
distinctions of fortune 

lycurgus understood perfectly that the luxury  the love of enjoyments 
and the inequality of fortunes  which property engenders  are the bane
of society  unfortunately the means which he employed to preserve his
republic were suggested to him by false notions of political economy 
and by a superficial knowledge of the human heart  accordingly 
property  which this legislator wrongly confounded with wealth 
reentered the city together with the swarm of evils which he was
endeavoring to banish  and this time sparta was hopelessly corrupted 


 the introduction of wealth   says m  pastoret   was one of the
principal causes of the misfortunes which they experienced  against
these  however  the laws had taken extraordinary precautions  the best
among which was the inculcation of morals which tended to suppress
desire  


the best of all precautions would have been the anticipation of desire
by satisfaction  possession is the sovereign remedy for cupidity 
a remedy which would have been the less perilous to sparta because
fortunes there were almost equal  and conditions were nearly alike  as a
general thing  fasting and abstinence are bad teachers of moderation 

 there was a law   says m  pastoret again   to prohibit the rich from
wearing better clothing than the poor  from eating more delicate food 
and from owning elegant furniture  vases  carpets  fine houses   &c 
lycurgus hoped  then  to maintain equality by rendering wealth useless 
how much wiser he would have been if  in accordance with his military
discipline  he had organized industry and taught the people to procure
by their own labor the things which he tried in vain to deprive them of 
in that case  enjoying happy thoughts and pleasant feelings  the citizen
would have known no other desire than that with which the legislator
endeavored to inspire him   love of honor and glory  the triumphs of
talent and virtue 

 gold and all kinds of ornaments were forbidden the women   absurd 
after the death of lycurgus  his institutions became corrupted  and four
centuries before the christian era not a vestige remained of the former
simplicity  luxury and the thirst for gold were early developed among
the spartans in a degree as intense as might have been expected from
their enforced poverty and their inexperience in the arts  historians
have accused pausanias  lysander  agesilaus  and others of having
corrupted the morals of their country by the introduction of wealth
obtained in war  it is a slander  the morals of the spartans necessarily
grew corrupt as soon as the lacedaemonian poverty came in contact with
persian luxury and athenian elegance  lycurgus  then  made a fatal
mistake in attempting to inspire generosity and modesty by enforcing
vain and proud simplicity 


 lycurgus was not frightened at idleness  a lacedemonian  happening to
be in athens  where idleness was forbidden  during the punishment of
a citizen who had been found guilty  asked to see the athenian thus
condemned for having exercised the rights of a free man     it was one
of the principles of lycurguss  acted upon for several centuries  that
free men should not follow lucrative professions     the women disdained
domestic labor  they did not spin their wool themselves  as did the
other greeks  they did not  then  read homer    they left their slaves
to make their clothing for them    pastoret  history of legislation 


could any thing be more contradictory  lycurgus proscribed property
among the citizens  and founded the means of subsistence on the worst
form of property   on property obtained by force  what wonder  after
that  that a lazy city  where no industry was carried on  became a den
of avarice  the spartans succumbed the more easily to the allurements of
luxury and asiatic voluptuousness  being placed entirely at their mercy
by their own coarseness  the same thing happened to the romans  when
military success took them out of italy   a thing which the author
of the prosopopoeia of fabricius could not explain  it is not the
cultivation of the arts which corrupts morals  but their degradation 
induced by inactive and luxurious opulence  the instinct of property
is to make the industry of daedalus  as well as the talent of phidias 
subservient to its own fantastic whims and disgraceful pleasures 
property  not wealth  ruined the spartans 

when solon appeared  the anarchy caused by property was at its height
in the athenian republic   the inhabitants of attica were divided
among themselves as to the form of government  those who lived on the
mountains  the poor  preferred the popular form  those of the plain
 the middle class   the oligarchs  those by the sea coast  a mixture
of oligarchy and democracy  other dissensions were arising from the
inequality of fortunes  the mutual antagonism of the rich and poor had
become so violent  that the one man power seemed the only safe guard
against the revolution with which the republic was threatened  
 pastoret  history of legislation  

quarrels between the rich and the poor  which seldom occur in
monarchies  because a well established power suppresses dissensions 
seem to be the life of popular governments  aristotle had noticed this 
the oppression of wealth submitted to agrarian laws  or to excessive
taxation  the hatred of the lower classes for the upper class  which
is exposed always to libellous charges made in hopes of
confiscation   these were the features of the athenian government which
were especially revolting to aristotle  and which caused him to favor
a limited monarchy  aristotle  if he had lived in our day  would have
supported the constitutional government  but  with all deference to the
stagirite  a government which sacrifices the life of the proletaire to
that of the proprietor is quite as irrational as one which supports the
former by robbing the latter  neither of them deserve the support of a
free man  much less of a philosopher 

solon followed the example of lycurgus  he celebrated his legislative
inauguration by the abolition of debts   that is  by bankruptcy  in
other words  solon wound up the governmental machine for a longer or
shorter time depending upon the rate of interest  consequently  when the
spring relaxed and the chain became unwound  the republic had either
to perish  or to recover itself by a second bankruptcy  this singular
policy was pursued by all the ancients  after the captivity of babylon 
nehemiah  the chief of the jewish nation  abolished debts  lycurgus
abolished debts  solon abolished debts  the roman people  after the
expulsion of the kings until the accession of the caesars  struggled
with the senate for the abolition of debts  afterwards  towards the
end of the republic  and long after the establishment of the empire 
agriculture being abandoned  and the provinces becoming depopulated
in consequence of the excessive rates of interest  the emperors freely
granted the lands to whoever would cultivate them   that is  they
abolished debts  no one  except lycurgus  who went to the other extreme 
ever perceived that the great point was  not to release debtors by a
coup d etat  but to prevent the contraction of debts in future 

on the contrary  the most democratic governments were always exclusively
based upon individual property  so that the social element of all these
republics was war between the citizens 

solon decreed that a census should be taken of all fortunes  regulated
political rights by the result  granted to the larger proprietors more
influence  established the balance of powers   in a word  inserted in
the constitution the most active leaven of discord  as if  instead of a
legislator chosen by the people  he had been their greatest enemy  is
it not  indeed  the height of imprudence to grant equality of political
rights to men of unequal conditions  if a manufacturer  uniting all
his workmen in a joint stock company  should give to each of them a
consultative and deliberative voice   that is  should make all of them
masters   would this equality of mastership secure continued inequality
of wages  that is the whole political system of solon  reduced to its
simplest expression 


 in giving property a just preponderance   says m  pastoret   solon
repaired  as far as he was able  his first official act   the abolition
of debts     he thought he owed it to public peace to make this great
sacrifice of acquired rights and natural equity  but the violation of
individual property and written contracts is a bad preface to a public
code  


in fact  such violations are always cruelly punished  in  89 and  93 
the possessions of the nobility and the clergy were confiscated  the
clever proletaires were enriched  and to day the latter  having become
aristocrats  are making us pay dearly for our fathers  robbery  what 
therefore  is to be done now  it is not for us to violate right  but to
restore it  now  it would be a violation of justice to dispossess some
and endow others  and then stop there  we must gradually lower the rate
of interest  organize industry  associate laborers and their functions 
and take a census of the large fortunes  not for the purpose of granting
privileges  but that we may effect their redemption by settling a
life annuity upon their proprietors  we must apply on a large scale the
principle of collective production  give the state eminent domain over
all capital  make each producer responsible  abolish the custom house 
and transform every profession and trade into a public function  thereby
large fortunes will vanish without confiscation or violence  individual
possession will establish itself  without communism  under the
inspection of the republic  and equality of conditions will no longer
depend simply on the will of citizens 

of the authors who have written upon the romans  bossuet and montesquieu
occupy prominent positions in the first rank  the first being generally
regarded as the father of the philosophy of history  and the second as
the most profound writer upon law and politics  nevertheless  it could
be shown that these two great writers  each of them imbued with the
prejudices of their century and their cloth  have left the question of
the causes of the rise and fall of the romans precisely where they found
it 

bossuet is admirable as long as he confines himself to description 
witness  among other passages  the picture which he has given us
of greece before the persian war  and which seems to have inspired
 telemachus   the parallel between athens and sparta  drawn twenty
times since bossuet  the description of the character and morals of
the ancient romans  and  finally  the sublime peroration which ends the
 discourse on universal history   but when the famous historian deals
with causes  his philosophy is at fault 


 the tribunes always favored the division of captured lands  or the
proceeds of their sale  among the citizens  the senate steadfastly
opposed those laws which were damaging to the state  and wanted the
price of lands to be awarded to the public treasury  


thus  according to bossuet  the first and greatest wrong of civil wars
was inflicted upon the people  who  dying of hunger  demanded that the
lands  which they had shed their blood to conquer  should be given to
them for cultivation  the patricians  who bought them to deliver to
their slaves  had more regard for justice and the public interests 
how little affects the opinions of men  if the roles of cicero and the
gracchi had been inverted  bossuet  whose sympathies were aroused by the
eloquence of the great orator more than by the clamors of the tribunes 
would have viewed the agrarian laws in quite a different light  he
then would have understood that the interest of the treasury was only
a pretext  that  when the captured lands were put up at auction  the
patricians hastened to buy them  in order to profit by the revenues from
them   certain  moreover  that the price paid would come back to them
sooner or later  in exchange either for supplies furnished by them to
the republic  or for the subsistence of the multitude  who could buy
only of them  and whose services at one time  and poverty at another 
were rewarded by the state  for a state does not hoard  on the contrary 
the public funds always return to the people  if  then  a certain number
of men are the sole dealers in articles of primary necessity  it follows
that the public treasury  in passing and repassing through their hands 
deposits and accumulates real property there 

when menenius related to the people his fable of the limbs and the
stomach  if any one had remarked to this story teller that the stomach
freely gives to the limbs the nourishment which it freely receives  but
that the patricians gave to the plebeians only for cash  and lent to
them only at usury  he undoubtedly would have silenced the wily senator 
and saved the people from a great imposition  the conscript fathers
were fathers only of their own line  as for the common people  they were
regarded as an impure race  exploitable  taxable  and workable at the
discretion and mercy of their masters 

as a general thing  bossuet shows little regard for the people  his
monarchical and theological instincts know nothing but authority 
obedience  and alms giving  under the name of charity 

this unfortunate disposition constantly leads him to mistake symptoms
for causes  and his depth  which is so much admired  is borrowed from
his authors  and amounts to very little  after all 

when he says  for instance  that  the dissensions in the republic  and
finally its fall  were caused by the jealousies of its citizens  and
their love of liberty carried to an extreme and intolerable extent   are
we not tempted to ask him what caused those jealousies   what inspired
the people with that love of liberty  extreme and intolerable  it would
be useless to reply  the corruption of morals  the disregard for the
ancient poverty  the debaucheries  luxury  and class jealousies  the
seditious character of the gracchi  &c  why did the morals become
corrupt  and whence arose those eternal dissensions between the
patricians and the plebeians 

in rome  as in all other places  the dissension between the rich and
the poor was not caused directly by the desire for wealth  people  as
a general thing  do not covet that which they deem it illegitimate to
acquire   but by a natural instinct of the plebeians  which led them to
seek the cause of their adversity in the constitution of the republic 
so we are doing to day  instead of altering our public economy  we
demand an electoral reform  the roman people wished to return to the
social compact  they asked for reforms  and demanded a revision of
the laws  and a creation of new magistracies  the patricians  who had
nothing to complain of  opposed every innovation  wealth always has been
conservative  nevertheless  the people overcame the resistance of the
senate  the electoral right was greatly extended  the privileges of
the plebeians were increased   they had their representatives  their
tribunes  and their consuls  but  notwithstanding these reforms  the
republic could not be saved  when all political expedients had been
exhausted  when civil war had depleted the population  when the caesars
had thrown their bloody mantle over the cancer which was consuming the
empire   inasmuch as accumulated property always was respected  and
since the fire never stopped  the nation had to perish in the flames 
the imperial power was a compromise which protected the property of the
rich  and nourished the proletaires with wheat from africa and sicily 
a double error  which destroyed the aristocrats by plethora and
the commoners by famine  at last there was but one real proprietor
left   the emperor   whose dependent  flatterer  parasite  or slave 
each citizen became  and when this proprietor was ruined  those who
gathered the crumbs from under his table  and laughed when he cracked
his jokes  perished also 

montesquieu succeeded no better than bossuet in fathoming the causes of
the roman decline  indeed  it may be said that the president has only
developed the ideas of the bishop  if the romans had been more moderate
in their conquests  more just to their allies  more humane to the
vanquished  if the nobles had been less covetous  the emperors less
lawless  the people less violent  and all classes less corrupt  if   
&c    perhaps the dignity of the empire might have been preserved  and
rome might have retained the sceptre of the world  that is all that can
be gathered from the teachings of montesquieu  but the truth of history
does not lie there  the destinies of the world are not dependent upon
such trivial causes  the passions of men  like the contingencies of time
and the varieties of climate  serve to maintain the forces which move
humanity and produce all historical changes  but they do not explain
them  the grain of sand of which pascal speaks would have caused the
death of one man only  had not prior action ordered the events of which
this death was the precursor 

montesquieu has read extensively  he knows roman history thoroughly  is
perfectly well acquainted with the people of whom he speaks  and sees
very clearly why they were able to conquer their rivals and govern the
world  while reading him we admire the romans  but we do not like them 
we witness their triumphs without pleasure  and we watch their fall
without sorrow  montesquieu s work  like the works of all french
writers  is skilfully composed   spirited  witty  and filled with wise
observations  he pleases  interests  instructs  but leads to little
reflection  he does not conquer by depth of thought  he does not exalt
the mind by elevated reason or earnest feeling  in vain should we search
his writings for knowledge of antiquity  the character of primitive
society  or a description of the heroic ages  whose morals and
prejudices lived until the last days of the republic  vico  painting the
romans with their horrible traits  represents them as excusable  because
he shows that all their conduct was governed by preexisting ideas and
customs  and that they were informed  so to speak  by a superior genius
of which they were unconscious  in montesquieu  the roman atrocity
revolts  but is not explained  therefore  as a writer  montesquieu
brings greater credit upon french literature  as a philosopher  vico
bears away the palm 

originally  property in rome was national  not private  numa was
the first to establish individual property by distributing the lands
captured by romulus  what was the dividend of this distribution effected
by numa  what conditions were imposed upon individuals  what powers
reserved to the state  none whatever  inequality of fortunes  absolute
abdication by the republic of its right of eminent domain over the
property of citizens   such were the first results of the division of
numa  who justly may be regarded as the originator of roman revolutions 
he it was who instituted the worship of the god terminus   the guardian
of private possession  and one of the most ancient gods of italy  it
was numa who placed property under the protection of jupiter  who 
in imitation of the etrurians  wished to make priests of the
land surveyors  who invented a liturgy for cadastral operations  and
ceremonies of consecration for the marking of boundaries   who  in
short  made a religion of property   51  all these fancies would have
been more beneficial than dangerous  if the holy king had not forgotten
one essential thing  namely  to fix the amount that each citizen could
possess  and on what conditions he could possess it  for  since it is
the essence of property to continually increase by accession and profit 
and since the lender will take advantage of every opportunity to apply
this principle inherent in property  it follows that properties tend  by
means of their natural energy and the religious respect which protects
them  to absorb each other  and fortunes to increase or diminish to an
indefinite extent   a process which necessarily results in the ruin
of the people  and the fall of the republic  roman history is but the
development of this law 


scarcely had the tarquins been banished from rome and the monarchy
abolished  when quarrels commenced between the orders  in the year
494 b c   the secession of the commonalty to the mons sacer led to the
establishment of the tribunate  of what did the plebeians complain 
that they were poor  exhausted by the interest which they paid to the
proprietors    foeneratoribus   that the republic  administered for the
benefit of the nobles  did nothing for the people  that  delivered over
to the mercy of their creditors  who could sell them and their children 
and having neither hearth nor home  they were refused the means of
subsistence  while the rate of interest was kept at its highest point 
&c  for five centuries  the sole policy of the senate was to evade
these just complaints  and  notwithstanding the energy of the tribunes 
notwithstanding the eloquence of the gracchi  the violence of marius 
and the triumph of caesar  this execrable policy succeeded only too
well  the senate always temporized  the measures proposed by the
tribunes might be good  but they were inopportune  it admitted that
something should be done  but first it was necessary that the people
should resume the performance of their duties  because the senate could
not yield to violence  and force must be employed only by the law  if
the people  out of respect for legality  took this beautiful advice  the
senate conjured up a difficulty  the reform was postponed  and that was
the end of it  on the contrary  if the demands of the proletaires became
too pressing  it declared a foreign war  and neighboring nations were
deprived of their liberty  to maintain the roman aristocracy 

but the toils of war were only a halt for the plebeians in their onward
march towards pauperism  the lands confiscated from the conquered
nations were immediately added to the domain of the state  to the ager
publicus  and  as such  cultivated for the benefit of the treasury  or 
as was more often the case  they were sold at auction  none of them were
granted to the proletaires  who  unlike the patricians and knights  were
not supplied by the victory with the means of buying them  war never
enriched the soldier  the extensive plundering has been done always by
the generals  the vans of augereau  and of twenty others  are famous in
our armies  but no one ever heard of a private getting rich  nothing was
more common in rome than charges of peculation  extortion  embezzlement 
and brigandage  carried on in the provinces at the head of armies  and
in other public capacities  all these charges were quieted by intrigue 
bribery of the judges  or desistance of the accuser  the culprit was
allowed always in the end to enjoy his spoils in peace  his son was only
the more respected on account of his father s crimes  and  in fact  it
could not be otherwise  what would become of us  if every deputy  peer 
or public functionary should be called upon to show his title to his
fortune 


 the patricians arrogated the exclusive enjoyment of the ager publicus 
and  like the feudal seigniors  granted some portions of their lands to
their dependants   a wholly precarious concession  revocable at the will
of the grantor  the plebeians  on the contrary  were entitled to the
enjoyment of only a little pasture land left to them in common 
an utterly unjust state of things  since  in consequence of it 
taxation   census   weighed more heavily upon the poor than upon the
rich  the patrician  in fact  always exempted himself from the tithe
which he owed as the price and as the acknowledgment of the concession
of domain  and  on the other hand  paid no taxes on his possessions 
if  as there is good reason to believe  only citizens  property was
taxed    laboulaye  history of property 


in order thoroughly to understand the preceding quotation  we must know
that the estates of citizens  that is  estates independent of the public
domain  whether they were obtained in the division of numa  or had since
been sold by the questors  were alone regarded as property  upon these
a tax  or  cense   was imposed  on the contrary  the estates obtained
by concessions of the public domain  of the ager publicus  for which a
light rent was paid   were called possessions  thus  among the romans 
there was a right of property and a right of possession regulating the
administration of all estates  now  what did the proletaires wish  that
the jus possessionis  the simple right of possession  should be extended
to them at the expense  as is evident  not of private property  but of
the public domain   agri publici  the proletaires  in short  demanded
that they should be tenants of the land which they had conquered  this
demand  the patricians in their avarice never would accede to  buying
as much of this land as they could  they afterwards found means of
obtaining the rest as possessions  upon this land they employed their
slaves  the people  who could not buy  on account of the competition
of the rich  nor hire  because  cultivating with their own hands  they
could not promise a rent equal to the revenue which the land would
yield when cultivated by slaves  were always deprived of possession and
property 

civil wars relieved  to some extent  the sufferings of the multitude 
 the people enrolled themselves under the banners of the ambitious  in
order to obtain by force that which the law refused them   property  a
colony was the reward of a victorious legion  but it was no longer
the ager publicus only  it was all italy that lay at the mercy of the
legions  the ager publicus disappeared almost entirely     but the
cause of the evil  accumulated property  became more potent than ever  
 laboulaye  history of property  


the author whom i quote does not tell us why this division of
territory which followed civil wars did not arrest the encroachments of
accumulated property  the omission is easily supplied  land is not
the only requisite for cultivation  a working stock is also
necessary   animals  tools  harnesses  a house  an advance  &c  where
did the colonists  discharged by the dictator who rewarded them  obtain
these things  from the purse of the usurers  that is  of the patricians 
to whom all these lands finally returned  in consequence of the rapid
increase of usury  and the seizure of estates  sallust  in his account
of the conspiracy of catiline  tells us of this fact  the conspirators
were old soldiers of sylla  who  as a reward for their services  had
received from him lands in cisalpine gaul  tuscany  and other parts of
the peninsula less than twenty years had elapsed since these colonists 
free of debt  had left the service and commenced farming  and already
they were crippled by usury  and almost ruined  the poverty caused
by the exactions of creditors was the life of this conspiracy which
well nigh inflamed all italy  and which  with a worthier chief and
fairer means  possibly would have succeeded  in rome  the mass of the
people were favorable to the conspirators   cuncta plebes catilinae
incepta probabat   the allies were weary of the patricians  robberies 
deputies from the allobroges  the savoyards  had come to rome to appeal
to the senate in behalf of their fellow citizens involved in debt  in
short  the complaint against the large proprietors was universal   we
call men and gods to witness   said the soldiers of catiline  who were
roman citizens with not a slave among them   that we have taken arms
neither against the country  nor to attack any one  but in defence of
our lives and liberties  wretched  poor  most of us deprived of country 
all of us of fame and fortune  by the violence and cruelty of usurers 
we have no rights  no property  no liberty    52 


the bad reputation of catiline  and his atrocious designs  the
imprudence of his accomplices  the treason of several  the strategy
of cicero  the angry outbursts of cato  and the terror of the
senate  baffled this enterprise  which  in furnishing a precedent for
expeditions against the rich  would perhaps have saved the republic  and
given peace to the world  but rome could not evade her destiny  the end
of her expiations had not come  a nation never was known to anticipate
its punishment by a sudden and unexpected conversion  now  the
long continued crimes of the eternal city could not be atoned for by
the massacre of a few hundred patricians  catiline came to stay divine
vengeance  therefore his conspiracy failed 

the encroachment of large proprietors upon small proprietors  by the aid
of usury  farm rent  and profits of all sorts  was common throughout the
empire  the most honest citizens invested their money at high rates of
interest   53  cato  cicero  brutus  all the stoics so noted for
their frugality   viri frugi    seneca  the teacher of virtue   levied
enormous taxes in the provinces  under the name of usury  and it is
something remarkable  that the last defenders of the republic  the proud
pompeys  were all usurious aristocrats  and oppressors of the poor 
but the battle of pharsalus  having killed men only  without touching
institutions  the encroachments of the large domains became every day
more active  ever since the birth of christianity  the fathers have
opposed this invasion with all their might  their writings are filled
with burning curses upon this crime of usury  of which christians are
not always innocent 


st  cyprian complains of certain bishops of his time  who  absorbed in
disgraceful stock jobbing operations  abandoned their churches  and went
about the provinces appropriating lands by artifice and fraud  while
lending money and piling up interests upon interests   54  why  in the
midst of this passion for accumulation  did not the possession of the
public land  like private property  become concentrated in a few hands 


by law  the domain of the state was inalienable  and consequently
possession was always revocable  but the edict of the praetor continued
it indefinitely  so that finally the possessions of the patricians were
transformed into absolute property  though the name  possessions 
was still applied to them  this conversion  instigated by senatorial
avarice  owed its accomplishment to the most deplorable and indiscreet
policy  if  in the time of tiberius gracchus  who wished to limit each
citizen s possession of the ager publicus to five hundred acres  the
amount of this possession had been fixed at as much as one family could
cultivate  and granted on the express condition that the possessor
should cultivate it himself  and should lease it to no one  the empire
never would have been desolated by large estates  and possession 
instead of increasing property  would have absorbed it  on what  then 
depended the establishment and maintenance of equality in conditions
and fortunes  on a more equitable division of the ager publicus  a wiser
distribution of the right of possession 

i insist upon this point  which is of the utmost importance  because
it gives us an opportunity to examine the history of this individual
possession  of which i said so much in my first memoir  and which so few
of my readers seem to have understood  the roman republic  having  as
it did  the power to dispose absolutely of its territory  and to impose
conditions upon possessors  was nearer to liberty and equality than any
nation has been since  if the senate had been intelligent and just   if 
at the time of the retreat to the mons sacer  instead of the ridiculous
farce enacted by menenius agrippa  a solemn renunciation of the right
to acquire had been made by each citizen on attaining his share of
possessions   the republic  based upon equality of possessions and the
duty of labor  would not  in attaining its wealth  have degenerated
in morals  fabricius would have enjoyed the arts without controlling
artists  and the conquests of the ancient romans would have been the
means of spreading civilization  instead of the series of murders and
robberies that they were 

but property  having unlimited power to amass and to lease  was daily
increased by the addition of new possessions  from the time of nero  six
individuals were the sole proprietors of one half of roman africa  in
the fifth century  the wealthy families had incomes of no less than
two millions  some possessed as many as twenty thousand slaves  all
the authors who have written upon the causes of the fall of the roman
republic concur 

m  giraud of aix  55  quotes the testimony of cicero  seneca  plutarch 
olympiodorus  and photius  under vespasian and titus  pliny  the
naturalist  exclaimed   large estates have ruined italy  and are ruining
the provinces  


but it never has been understood that the extension of property was
effected then  as it is to day  under the aegis of the law  and by
virtue of the constitution  when the senate sold captured lands at
auction  it was in the interest of the treasury and of public welfare 
when the patricians bought up possessions and property  they realized
the purpose of the senate s decrees  when they lent at high rates of
interest  they took advantage of a legal privilege   property   said the
lender   is the right to enjoy even to the extent of abuse   jus utendi
et abutendi   that is  the right to lend at interest   to lease  to
acquire  and then to lease and lend again   but property is also the
right to exchange  to transfer  and to sell  if  then  the social
condition is such that the proprietor  ruined by usury  may be compelled
to sell his possession  the means of his subsistence  he will sell
it  and  thanks to the law  accumulated property  devouring and
anthropophagous property  will be established  56 


the immediate and secondary cause of the decline of the romans
was  then  the internal dissensions between the two orders of the
republic   the patricians and the plebeians   dissensions which gave
rise to civil wars  proscriptions  and loss of liberty  and finally led
to the empire  but the primary and mediate cause of their decline was
the establishment by numa of the institution of property 

i end with an extract from a work which i have quoted several times
already  and which has recently received a prize from the academy of
moral and political sciences   


 the concentration of property   says m  laboulaye   while causing
extreme poverty  forced the emperors to feed and amuse the people  that
they might forget their misery   panem et circenses   that was the roman
law in regard to the poor  a dire and perhaps a necessary evil wherever
a landed aristocracy exists 

 to feed these hungry mouths  grain was brought from africa and the
provinces  and distributed gratuitously among the needy  in the time of
caesar  three hundred and twenty thousand people were thus fed  augustus
saw that such a measure led directly to the destruction of husbandry 
but to abolish these distributions was to put a weapon within the reach
of the first aspirant for power 

 the emperor shrank at the thought 

 while grain was gratuitous  agriculture was impossible  tillage gave
way to pasturage  another cause of depopulation  even among slaves 

 finally  luxury  carried further and further every day  covered the
soil of italy with elegant villas  which occupied whole cantons  gardens
and groves replaced the fields  and the free population fled to the
towns  husbandry disappeared almost entirely  and with husbandry the
husbandman  africa furnished the wheat  and greece the wine  tiberius
complained bitterly of this evil  which placed the lives of the roman
people at the mercy of the winds and waves  that was his anxiety  one
day later  and three hundred thousand starving men walked the streets of
rome  that was a revolution 

 this decline of italy and the provinces did not stop  after the
reign of nero  depopulation commenced in towns as noted as antium and
tarentum  under the reign of pertinax  there was so much desert land
that the emperor abandoned it  even that which belonged to the treasury 
to whoever would cultivate it  besides exempting the farmers from
taxation for a period of ten years  senators were compelled to invest
one third of their fortunes in real estate in italy  but this measure
served only to increase the evil which they wished to cure  to force
the rich to possess in italy was to increase the large estates which
had ruined the country  and must i say  finally  that aurelian wished to
send the captives into the desert lands of etruria  and that valentinian
was forced to settle the alamanni on the fertile banks of the po  


if the reader  in running through this book  should complain of meeting
with nothing but quotations from other works  extracts from journals
and public lectures  comments upon laws  and interpretations of them  i
would remind him that the very object of this memoir is to establish the
conformity of my opinion concerning property with that universally held 
that  far from aiming at a paradox  it has been my main study to follow
the advice of the world  and  finally  that my sole pretension is to
clearly formulate the general belief  i cannot repeat it too often   and
i confess it with pride   i teach absolutely nothing that is new  and i
should regard the doctrine which i advocate as radically erroneous  if a
single witness should testify against it 

let us now trace the revolutions in property among the barbarians 

as long as the german tribes dwelt in their forests  it did not occur
to them to divide and appropriate the soil  the land was held in common 
each individual could plow  sow  and reap  but  when the empire was once
invaded  they bethought themselves of sharing the land  just as
they shared spoils after a victory   hence   says m  laboulaye   the
expressions  sortes burgundiorum gothorum  and  greek    k    hence the
german words  allod   allodium  and  loos   lot  which are used in all
modern languages to designate the gifts of chance  

allodial property  at least with the mass of coparceners  was originally
held  then  in equal shares  for all of the prizes were equal  or  at
least  equivalent  this property  like that of the romans  was wholly
individual  independent  exclusive  transferable  and consequently
susceptible of accumulation and invasion  but  instead of its being  as
was the case among the romans  the large estate which  through
increase and usury  subordinated and absorbed the small one  among
the barbarians  fonder of war than of wealth  more eager to dispose
of persons than to appropriate things  it was the warrior who  through
superiority of arms  enslaved his adversary  the roman wanted matter 
the barbarian wanted man  consequently  in the feudal ages  rents were
almost nothing   simply a hare  a partridge  a pie  a few pints of wine
brought by a little girl  or a maypole set up within the suzerain s
reach  in return  the vassal or incumbent had to follow the seignior
to battle  a thing which happened almost every day   and equip and feed
himself at his own expense   this spirit of the german tribes  this
spirit of companionship and association  governed the territory as it
governed individuals  the lands  like the men  were secured to a chief
or seignior by a bond of mutual protection and fidelity  this subjection
was the labor of the german epoch which gave birth to feudalism  by fair
means or foul  every proprietor who could not be a chief was forced to
be a vassal    laboulaye  history of property  

by fair means or foul  every mechanic who cannot be a master has to be
a journeyman  every proprietor who is not an invader will be invaded 
every producer who cannot  by the exploitation of other men  furnish
products at less than their proper value  will lose his labor 
corporations and masterships  which are hated so bitterly  but which
will reappear if we are not careful  are the necessary results of
the principle of competition which is inherent in property  their
organization was patterned formerly after that of the feudal hierarchy 
which was the result of the subordination of men and possessions 

the times which paved the way for the advent of feudalism and the
reappearance of large proprietors were times of carnage and the most
frightful anarchy  never before had murder and violence made such havoc
with the human race  the tenth century  among others  if my memory
serves me rightly  was called the century of iron  his property  his
life  and the honor of his wife and children always in danger the
small proprietor made haste to do homage to his seignior  and to
bestow something on the church of his freehold  that he might receive
protection and security 


 both facts and laws bear witness that from the sixth to the tenth
century the proprietors of small freeholds were gradually plundered 
or reduced by the encroachments of large proprietors and counts to the
condition of either vassals or tributaries  the capitularies are full
of repressive provisions  but the incessant reiteration of these
threats only shows the perseverance of the evil and the impotency of the
government  oppression  moreover  varies but little in its methods  the
complaints of the free proprietors  and the groans of the plebeians
at the time of the gracchi  were one and the same  it is said that 
whenever a poor man refused to give his estate to the bishop  the
curate  the count  the judge  or the centurion  these immediately sought
an opportunity to ruin him  they made him serve in the army until 
completely ruined  he was induced  by fair means or foul  to give up his
freehold    laboulaye  history of property 

how many small proprietors and manufacturers have not been ruined by
large ones through chicanery  law suits  and competition  strategy 
violence  and usury   such are the proprietor s methods of plundering
the laborer 

thus we see property  at all ages and in all its forms  oscillating by
virtue of its principle between two opposite terms   extreme division
and extreme accumulation 

property  at its first term  is almost null  reduced to personal
exploitation  it is property only potentially  at its second term  it
exists in its perfection  then it is truly property 

when property is widely distributed  society thrives  progresses  grows 
and rises quickly to the zenith of its power  thus  the jews  after
leaving babylon with esdras and nehemiah  soon became richer and more
powerful than they had been under their kings  sparta was in a strong
and prosperous condition during the two or three centuries which
followed the death of lycurgus  the best days of athens were those of
the persian war  rome  whose inhabitants were divided from the beginning
into two classes   the exploiters and the exploited   knew no such thing
as peace 

when property is concentrated  society  abusing itself  polluted  so
to speak  grows corrupt  wears itself out  how shall i express this
horrible idea   plunges into long continued and fatal luxury 

when feudalism was established  society had to die of the same disease
which killed it under the caesars   i mean accumulated property  but
humanity  created for an immortal destiny  is deathless  the revolutions
which disturb it are purifying crises  invariably followed by more
vigorous health  in the fifth century  the invasion of the barbarians
partially restored the world to a state of natural equality  in the
twelfth century  a new spirit pervading all society gave the slave his
rights  and through justice breathed new life into the heart of nations 
it has been said  and often repeated  that christianity regenerated the
world  that is true  but it seems to me that there is a mistake in
the date  christianity had no influence upon roman society  when the
barbarians came  that society had disappeared  for such is god s curse
upon property  every political organization based upon the exploitation
of man  shall perish  slave labor is death to the race of tyrants  the
patrician families became extinct  as the feudal families did  and as
all aristocracies must 

it was in the middle ages  when a reactionary movement was beginning
to secretly undermine accumulated property  that the influence of
christianity was first exercised to its full extent 

the destruction of feudalism  the conversion of the serf into the
commoner  the emancipation of the communes  and the admission of the
third estate to political power  were deeds accomplished by christianity
exclusively  i say christianity  not ecclesiasticism  for the priests
and bishops were themselves large proprietors  and as such often
persecuted the villeins  without the christianity of the middle ages 
the existence of modern society could not be explained  and would not be
possible 

the truth of this assertion is shown by the very facts which m 
laboulaye quotes  although this author inclines to the opposite opinion 
 57 

now  we did not commence to love god and to think of our salvation until
after the promulgation of the gospel 


1  slavery among the romans    the roman slave was  in the eyes of
the law  only a thing   no more than an ox or a horse  he had neither
property  family  nor personality  he was defenceless against his
master s cruelty  folly  or cupidity   sell your oxen that are past
use   said cato   sell your calves  your lambs  your wool  your hides 
your old ploughs  your old iron  your old slave  and your sick slave 
and all that is of no use to you   when no market could be found for the
slaves that were worn out by sickness or old age  they were abandoned to
starvation  claudius was the first defender of this shameful practice  


 discharge your old workman   says the economist of the proprietary
school   turn off that sick domestic  that toothless and worn out
servant  put away the unserviceable beauty  to the hospital with the
useless mouths  


 the condition of these wretched beings improved but little under the
emperors  and the best that can be said of the goodness of antoninus
is that he prohibited intolerable cruelty  as an abuse of property 
 expedit enim reipublicae ne quis re re sua male utatur   says gaius 

 as soon as the church met in council  it launched an anathema against
the masters who had exercised over their slaves this terrible right of
life and death  were not the slaves  thanks to the right of sanctuary
and to their poverty  the dearest proteges of religion  constantine  who
embodied in the laws the grand ideas of christianity  valued the life of
a slave as highly as that of a freeman  and declared the master  who had
intentionally brought death upon his slave  guilty of murder  between
this law and that of antoninus there is a complete revolution in moral
ideas  the slave was a thing  religion has made him a man  

note the last words   between the law of the gospel and that of
antoninus there is a complete revolution in moral ideas  the slave was
a thing  religion has made him a man   the moral revolution which
transformed the slave into a citizen was effected  then  by christianity
before the barbarians set foot upon the soil of the empire  we have
only to trace the progress of this moral revolution in the personnel
of society   but   m  laboulaye rightly says   it did not change the
condition of men in a moment  any more than that of things  between
slavery and liberty there was an abyss which could not be filled in a
day  the transitional step was servitude  

now  what was servitude  in what did it differ from roman slavery  and
whence came this difference  let the same author answer 


2  of servitude    i see  in the lord s manor  slaves charged with
domestic duties  some are employed in the personal service of the
master  others are charged with household cares  the women spin the
wool  the men grind the grain  make the bread  or practise  in the
interest of the seignior  what little they know of the industrial arts 
the master punishes them when he chooses  kills them with impunity  and
sells them and theirs like so many cattle  the slave has no personality 
and consequently no  wehrgeld   59  peculiar to himself  he is a thing 
the  wehrgeld  belongs to the master as a compensation for the loss of
his property  whether the slave is killed or stolen  the indemnity does
not change  for the injury is the same  but the indemnity increases or
diminishes according to the value of the serf  in all these particulars
germanic slavery and roman servitude are alike  

this similarity is worthy of notice  slavery is always the same  whether
in a roman villa or on a barbarian farm  the man  like the ox and the
ass  is a part of the live stock  a price is set upon his head  he is a
tool without a conscience  a chattel without personality  an impeccable 
irresponsible being  who has neither rights nor duties 


why did his condition improve 


 in good season      when    the serf began to be regarded as a man 
and  as such  the law of the visigoths  under the influence of christian
ideas  punished with fine or banishment any one who maimed or killed
him  


always christianity  always religion  though we should like to speak
of the laws only  did the philanthropy of the visigoths make its first
appearance before or after the preaching of the gospel  this point must
be cleared up 


 after the conquest  the serfs were scattered over the large estates
of the barbarians  each having his house  his lot  and his peculium  in
return for which he paid rent and performed service  they were rarely
separated from their homes when their land was sold  they and all that
they had became the property of the purchaser  the law favored this
realization of the serf  in not allowing him to be sold out of the
country  


what inspired this law  destructive not only of slavery  but of property
itself  for  if the master cannot drive from his domain the slave whom
he has once established there  it follows that the slave is proprietor 
as well as the master 


 the barbarians   again says m  laboulaye   were the first to recognize
the slave s rights of family and property   two rights which are
incompatible with slavery  


but was this recognition the necessary result of the mode of servitude
in vogue among the germanic nations previous to their conversion to
christianity  or was it the immediate effect of that spirit of justice
infused with religion  by which the seignior was forced to respect in
the serf a soul equal to his own  a brother in jesus christ  purified by
the same baptism  and redeemed by the same sacrifice of the son of god
in the form of man  for we must not close our eyes to the fact that 
though the barbarian morals and the ignorance and carelessness of the
seigniors  who busied themselves mainly with wars and battles  paying
little or no attention to agriculture  may have been great aids in
the emancipation of the serfs  still the vital principle of this
emancipation was essentially christian  suppose that the barbarians had
remained pagans in the midst of a pagan world  as they did not change
the gospel  so they would not have changed the polytheistic customs 
slavery would have remained what it was  they would have continued to
kill the slaves who were desirous of liberty  family  and property 
whole nations would have been reduced to the condition of helots 
nothing would have changed upon the terrestrial stage  except the
actors  the barbarians were less selfish  less imperious  less
dissolute  and less cruel than the romans  such was the nature upon
which  after the fall of the empire and the renovation of society 
christianity was to act  but this nature  grounded as in former times
upon slavery and war  would  by its own energy  have produced nothing
but war and slavery 


 gradually the serfs obtained the privilege of being judged by the same
standard as their masters     

when  how  and by what title did they obtain this privilege 

 gradually their duties were regulated  


whence came the regulations  who had the authority to introduce them 


 the master took a part of the labor of the serf   three days  for
instance   and left the rest to him  as for sunday  that belonged to
god  


and what established sunday  if not religion  whence i infer  that
the same power which took it upon itself to suspend hostilities and
to lighten the duties of the serf was also that which regulated the
judiciary and created a sort of law for the slave 

but this law itself  on what did it bear   what was its principle   what
was the philosophy of the councils and popes with reference to this
matter  the reply to all these questions  coming from me alone  would
be distrusted  the authority of m  laboulaye shall give credence to my
words  this holy philosophy  to which the slaves were indebted for every
thing  this invocation of the gospel  was an anathema against property 

the proprietors of small freeholds  that is  the freemen of the middle
class  had fallen  in consequence of the tyranny of the nobles  into a
worse condition than that of the tenants and serfs   the expenses of war
weighed less heavily upon the serf than upon the freeman  and  as for
legal protection  the seigniorial court  where the serf was judged by
his peers  was far preferable to the cantonal assembly  it was better to
have a noble for a seignior than for a judge  

so it is better to day to have a man of large capital for an associate
than for a rival  the honest tenant  the laborer who earns weekly a
moderate but constant salary  is more to be envied than the independent
but small farmer  or the poor licensed mechanic 

at that time  all were either seigniors or serfs  oppressors or
oppressed   then  under the protection of convents  or of the
seigniorial turret  new societies were formed  which silently spread
over the soil made fertile by their hands  and which derived their power
from the annihilation of the free classes whom they enlisted in their
behalf  as tenants  these men acquired  from generation to generation 
sacred rights over the soil which they cultivated in the interest of
lazy and pillaging masters  as fast as the social tempest abated  it
became necessary to respect the union and heritage of these villeins 
who by their labor had truly prescribed the soil for their own profit  

i ask how prescription could take effect where a contrary title and
possession already existed  m  laboulaye is a lawyer  where  then  did
he ever see the labor of the slave and the cultivation by the tenant
prescribe the soil for their own profit  to the detriment of a
recognized master daily acting as a proprietor  let us not disguise
matters  as fast as the tenants and the serfs grew rich  they wished
to be independent and free  they commenced to associate  unfurl their
municipal banners  raise belfries  fortify their towns  and refuse to
pay their seigniorial dues  in doing these things they were perfectly
right  for  in fact  their condition was intolerable  but in law  i mean
in roman and napoleonic law  their refusal to obey and pay tribute to
their masters was illegitimate 

now  this imperceptible usurpation of property by the commonalty was
inspired by religion 

the seignior had attached the serf to the soil  religion granted the
serf rights over the soil  the seignior imposed duties upon the serf 
religion fixed their limits  the seignior could kill the serf with
impunity  could deprive him of his wife  violate his daughter  pillage
his house  and rob him of his savings  religion checked his invasions 
it excommunicated the seignior  religion was the real cause of the
ruin of feudal property  why should it not be bold enough to day to
resolutely condemn capitalistic property  since the middle ages  there
has been no change in social economy except in its forms  its relations
remain unaltered 

the only result of the emancipation of the serfs was that property
changed hands  or  rather  that new proprietors were created  sooner
or later the extension of privilege  far from curing the evil  was to
operate to the disadvantage of the plebeians  nevertheless  the new
social organization did not meet with the same end in all places  in
lombardy  for example  where the people rapidly growing rich through
commerce and industry soon conquered the authorities  even to the
exclusion of the nobles   first  the nobility became poor and degraded 
and were forced  in order to live and maintain their credit  to gain
admission to the guilds  then  the ordinary subalternization of property
leading to inequality of fortunes  to wealth and poverty  to jealousies
and hatreds  the cities passed rapidly from the rankest democracy under
the yoke of a few ambitious leaders  such was the fate of most of the
lombardic cities   genoa  florence  bologna  milan  pisa  &c    which
afterwards changed rulers frequently  but which have never since risen
in favor of liberty  the people can easily escape from the tyranny of
despots  but they do not know how to throw off the effects of their own
despotism  just as we avoid the assassin s steel  while we succumb to a
constitutional malady  as soon as a nation becomes proprietor  either
it must perish  or a foreign invasion must force it again to begin its
evolutionary round   59 

 the communes once organized  the kings treated them as superior
vassals  now  just as the under vassal had no communication with the
king except through the direct vassal  so also the commoners could enter
no complaints except through the commune 

 like causes produce like effects  each commune became a small and
separate state  governed by a few citizens  who sought to extend their
authority over the others  who  in their turn  revenged themselves
upon the unfortunate inhabitants who had not the right of citizenship 
feudalism in unemancipated countries  and oligarchy in the communes 
made nearly the same ravages  there were sub associations  fraternities 
tradesmen s associations in the communes  and colleges in the
universities  the oppression was so great  that it was no rare thing to
see the inhabitants of a commune demanding its suppression       meyer 
judicial institutions of europe 


in france  the revolution was much more gradual  the communes  in taking
refuge under the protection of the kings  had found them masters rather
than protectors  their liberty had long since been lost  or  rather 
their emancipation had been suspended  when feudalism received its
death blow at the hand of richelieu  then liberty halted  the prince of
the feudatories held sole and undivided sway  the nobles  the clergy 
the commoners  the parliaments  every thing in short except a few
seeming privileges  were controlled by the king  who  like his early
predecessors  consumed regularly  and nearly always in advance  the
revenues of his domain   and that domain was france 

finally   89 arrived  liberty resumed its march  a century and a
half had been required to wear out the last form of feudal
property   monarchy 

the french revolution may be defined as  the substitution of real right
for personal right   that is to say  in the days of feudalism  the value
of property depended upon the standing of the proprietor  while  after
the revolution  the regard for the man was proportional to his property 
now  we have seen from what has been said in the preceding pages  that
this recognition of the right of laborers had been the constant aim of
the serfs and communes  the secret motive of their efforts  the movement
of  89 was only the last stage of that long insurrection  but it seems
to me that we have not paid sufficient attention to the fact that the
revolution of 1789  instigated by the same causes  animated by the same
spirit  triumphing by the same struggles  was consummated in italy four
centuries ago  italy was the first to sound the signal of war against
feudalism  france has followed  spain and england are beginning to move 
the rest still sleep  if a grand example should be given to the world 
the day of trial would be much abridged 

note the following summary of the revolutions of property  from the days
of the roman empire down to the present time   

1  fifth century   barbarian invasions  division of the lands of the
empire into independent portions or freeholds 

2  from the fifth to the eighth century   gradual concentration of
freeholds  or transformation of the small freeholds into fiefs  feuds 
tenures  &c  large properties  small possessions  charlemagne  771 814 
decrees that all freeholds are dependent upon the king of france 

3  from the eighth to the tenth century   the relation between the crown
and the superior dependents is broken  the latter becoming freeholders 
while the smaller dependents cease to recognize the king  and adhere to
the nearest suzerain  feudal system 

4  twelfth century   movement of the serfs towards liberty  emancipation
of the communes 

5  thirteenth century   abolition of personal right  and of the feudal
system in italy  italian republics 

6  seventeenth century   abolition of feudalism in france during
richelieu s ministry  despotism 

7  1789   abolition of all privileges of birth  caste  provinces  and
corporations  equality of persons and of rights  french democracy 

8  1830   the principle of concentration inherent in individual property
is remarked  development of the idea of association 


the more we reflect upon this series of transformations and changes 
the more clearly we see that they were necessary in their principle  in
their manifestations  and in their result 

it was necessary that inexperienced conquerors  eager for liberty 
should divide the roman empire into a multitude of estates  as free and
independent as themselves 

it was necessary that these men  who liked war even better than liberty 
should submit to their leaders  and  as the freehold represented the
man  that property should violate property 

it was necessary that  under the rule of a nobility always idle when not
fighting  there should grow up a body of laborers  who  by the power
of production  and by the division and circulation of wealth  would
gradually gain control over commerce  industry  and a portion of the
land  and who  having become rich  would aspire to power and authority
also 

it was necessary  finally  that liberty and equality of rights having
been achieved  and individual property still existing  attended by
robbery  poverty  social inequality  and oppression  there should be
an inquiry into the cause of this evil  and an idea of universal
association formed  whereby  on condition of labor  all interests should
be protected and consolidated 

 evil  when carried too far   says a learned jurist   cures itself  and
the political innovation which aims to increase the power of the state 
finally succumbs to the effects of its own work  the germans  to secure
their independence  chose chiefs  and soon they were oppressed by their
kings and noblemen  the monarchs surrounded themselves with volunteers 
in order to control the freemen  and they found themselves dependent
upon their proud vassals  the  missi dominici  were sent into the
provinces to maintain the power of the emperors  and to protect the
people from the oppressions of the noblemen  and not only did they usurp
the imperial power to a great extent  but they dealt more severely with
the inhabitants  the freemen became vassals  in order to get rid of
military service and court duty  and they were immediately involved in
all the personal quarrels of their seigniors  and compelled to do
jury duty in their courts     the kings protected the cities and
the communes  in the hope of freeing them from the yoke of the grand
vassals  and of rendering their own power more absolute  and those same
communes have  in several european countries  procured the establishment
of a constitutional power  are now holding royalty in check  and
are giving rise to a universal desire for political reform    meyer 
judicial institutions of europe 


in recapitulation 

what was feudalism  a confederation of the grand seign iors against the
villeins  and against the king   60  what is constitutional government 
a confederation of the bourgeoisie against the laborers  and against the
king   61 


how did feudalism end  in the union of the communes and the royal
authority  how will the bourgeoisie aristocracy end  in the union of the
proletariat and the sovereign power 

what was the immediate result of the struggle of the communes and the
king against the seigniors  the monarchical unity of louis xiv  what
will be the result of the struggle of the proletariat and the sovereign
power combined against the bourgeoisie  the absolute unity of the nation
and the government 

it remains to be seen whether the nation  one and supreme  will be
represented in its executive and central power by one  by five  by one
hundred  or one thousand  that is  it remains to be seen  whether the
royalty of the barricades intends to maintain itself by the people  or
without the people  and whether louis philippe wishes his reign to be
the most famous in all history 

i have made this statement as brief  but at the same time as accurate
as i could  neglecting facts and details  that i might give the more
attention to the economical relations of society  for the study of
history is like the study of the human organism  just as the latter
has its system  its organs  and its functions  which can be treated
separately  so the former has its ensemble  its instruments  and its
causes  of course i do not pretend that the principle of property is
a complete resume of all the social forces  but  as in that wonderful
machine which we call our body  the harmony of the whole allows us to
draw a general conclusion from the consideration of a single function or
organ  so  in discussing historical causes  i have been able to reason
with absolute accuracy from a single order of facts  certain as i was
of the perfect correlation which exists between this special order and
universal history  as is the property of a nation  so is its family 
its marriage  its religion  its civil and military organization  and
its legislative and judicial institutions  history  viewed from this
standpoint  is a grand and sublime psychological study 

well  sir  in writing against property  have i done more than quote the
language of history  i have said to modern society   the daughter and
heiress of all preceding societies    age guod agis   complete the
task which for six thousand years you have been executing under the
inspiration and by the command of god  hasten to finish your journey 
turn neither to the right nor the left  but follow the road which lies
before you  you seek reason  law  unity  and discipline  but hereafter
you can find them only by stripping off the veils of your infancy  and
ceasing to follow instinct as a guide  awaken your sleeping conscience 
open your eyes to the pure light of reflection and science  behold the
phantom which troubled your dreams  and so long kept you in a state of
unutterable anguish  know thyself  o long deluded society 1  know thy
enemy     and i have denounced property 

we often hear the defenders of the right of domain quote in defence of
their views the testimony of nations and ages  we can judge  from what
has just been said  how far this historical argument conforms to the
real facts and the conclusions of science 

to complete this apology  i must examine the various theories 

neither politics  nor legislation  nor history  can be explained and
understood  without a positive theory which defines their elements 
and discovers their laws  in short  without a philosophy  now  the two
principal schools  which to this day divide the attention of the world 
do not satisfy this condition 

the first  essentially practical in its character  confined to a
statement of facts  and buried in learning  cares very little by what
laws humanity develops itself  to it these laws are the secret of the
almighty  which no one can fathom without a commission from on high 
in applying the facts of history to government  this school does not
reason  it does not anticipate  it makes no comparison of the past with
the present  in order to predict the future  in its opinion  the
lessons of experience teach us only to repeat old errors  and its whole
philosophy consists in perpetually retracing the tracks of antiquity 
instead of going straight ahead forever in the direction in which they
point 

the second school may be called either fatalistic or pantheistic  to
it the movements of empires and the revolutions of humanity are the
manifestations  the incarnations  of the almighty  the human race 
identified with the divine essence  wheels in a circle of appearances 
informations  and destructions  which necessarily excludes the idea of
absolute truth  and destroys providence and liberty 

corresponding to these two schools of history  there are two schools
of jurisprudence  similarly opposed  and possessed of the same
peculiarities 

1  the practical and conventional school  to which the law is always a
creation of the legislator  an expression of his will  a privilege
which he condescends to grant   in short  a gratuitous affirmation to be
regarded as judicious and legitimate  no matter what it declares 

2  the fatalistic and pantheistic school  sometimes called the
historical school  which opposes the despotism of the first  and
maintains that law  like literature and religion  is always the
expression of society   its manifestation  its form  the external
realization of its mobile spirit and its ever changing inspirations 

each of these schools  denying the absolute  rejects thereby all
positive and a priori philosophy 

now  it is evident that the theories of these two schools  whatever view
we take of them  are utterly unsatisfactory  for  opposed  they form no
dilemma   that is  if one is false  it does not follow that the other
is true  and  united  they do not constitute the truth  since they
disregard the absolute  without which there is no truth  they are
respectively a thesis and an antithesis  there remains to be found 
then  a synthesis  which  predicating the absolute  justifies the will
of the legislator  explains the variations of the law  annihilates
the theory of the circular movement of humanity  and demonstrates its
progress 

the legists  by the very nature of their studies and in spite of their
obstinate prejudices  have been led irresistibly to suspect that the
absolute in the science of law is not as chimerical as is commonly
supposed  and this suspicion arose from their comparison of the various
relations which legislators have been called upon to regulate 

m  laboulaye  the laureate of the institute  begins his  history of
property  with these words   


 while the law of contract  which regulates only the mutual interests of
men  has not varied for centuries  except in certain forms which relate
more to the proof than to the character of the obligation   the civil
law of property  which regulates the mutual relations of citizens  has
undergone several radical changes  and has kept pace in its variations
with all the vicissitudes of society  the law of contract  which holds
essentially to those principles of eternal justice which are engraven
upon the depths of the human heart  is the immutable element of
jurisprudence  and  in a certain sense  its philosophy  property  on
the contrary  is the variable element of jurisprudence  its history  its
policy  


marvellous  there is in law  and consequently in politics  something
variable and something invariable  the invariable element is obligation 
the bond of justice  duty  the variable element is property   that is 
the external form of law  the subject matter of the contract  whence
it follows that the law can modify  change  reform  and judge property 
reconcile that  if you can  with the idea of an eternal  absolute 
permanent  and indefectible right 

however  m  laboulaye is in perfect accord with himself when he adds 
 possession of the soil rests solely upon force until society takes it
in hand  and espouses the cause of the possessor    62  and  a little
farther   the right of property is not natural  but social  the laws not
only protect property  they give it birth   &c  now  that which the
law has made the law can unmake  especially since  according to
m  laboulaye   an avowed partisan of the historical or pantheistic
school   the law is not absolute  is not an idea  but a form 


but why is it that property is variable  and  unlike obligation 
incapable of definition and settlement  before affirming  somewhat
boldly without doubt  that in right there are no absolute principles
 the most dangerous  most immoral  most tyrannical  in a word  most
anti social  assertion imaginable   it was proper that the right of
property should be subjected to a thorough examination  in order to put
in evidence its variable  arbitrary  and contingent elements  and
those which are eternal  legitimate  and absolute  then  this operation
performed  it became easy to account for the laws  and to correct all
the codes 

now  this examination of property i claim to have made  and in the
fullest detail  but  either from the public s lack of interest in
an unrecommended and unattractive pamphlet  or  which is more
probable  from the weakness of exposition and want of genius which
characterize the work  the first memoir on property passed unnoticed 
scarcely would a few communists  having turned its leaves  deign to
brand it with their disapprobation  you alone  sir  in spite of the
disfavor which i showed for your economical predecessors in too severe
a criticism of them   you alone have judged me justly  and although i
cannot accept  at least literally  your first judgment  yet it is to
you alone that i appeal from a decision too equivocal to be regarded as
final 

it not being my intention to enter at present into a discussion of
principles  i shall content myself with estimating  from the point of
view of this simple and intelligible absolute  the theories of property
which our generation has produced 

the most exact idea of property is given us by the roman law  faithfully
followed in this particular by the ancient legists  it is the absolute 
exclusive  autocratic domain of a man over a thing   a domain which
begins by usucaption  is maintained by possession  and finally  by the
aid of prescription  finds its sanction in the civil law  a domain which
so identifies the man with the thing  that the proprietor can say   he
who uses my field  virtually compels me to labor for him  therefore he
owes me compensation  

i pass in silence the secondary modes by which property can be
acquired    tradition  sale  exchange  inheritance   &c    which have
nothing in common with the origin of property 

accordingly  pothier said the domain of property  and not simply
property  and the most learned writers on jurisprudence  in imitation
of the roman praetor who recognized a right of property and a right
of possession  have carefully distinguished between the domain and the
right of usufruct  use  and habitation  which  reduced to its natural
limits  is the very expression of justice  and which is  in my opinion 
to supplant domanial property  and finally form the basis of all
jurisprudence 

but  sir  admire the clumsiness of systems  or rather the fatality of
logic  while the roman law and all the savants inspired by it teach that
property in its origin is the right of first occupancy sanctioned by
law  the modern legists  dissatisfied with this brutal definition  claim
that property is based upon labor  immediately they infer that he who no
longer labors  but makes another labor in his stead  loses his right to
the earnings of the latter  it is by virtue of this principle that
the serfs of the middle ages claimed a legal right to property  and
consequently to the enjoyment of political rights  that the clergy were
despoiled in  89 of their immense estates  and were granted a pension
in exchange  that at the restoration the liberal deputies opposed the
indemnity of one billion francs   the nation   said they   has acquired
by twenty five years of labor and possession the property which the
emigrants forfeited by abandonment and long idleness  why should the
nobles be treated with more favor than the priests    63 


this position is quite in harmony with my principles  and i heartily
applaud the indignation of m  lerminier  but i do not know that a
proprietor was ever deprived of his property because unworthy  and as
reasonable  social  and even useful as the thing may seem  it is quite
contrary to the uses and customs of property 


all usurpations  not born of war  have been caused and supported by
labor  all modern history proves this  from the end of the roman empire
down to the present day  and as if to give a sort of legal sanction to
these usurpations  the doctrine of labor  subversive of property 
is professed at great length in the roman law under the name of
prescription 

the man who cultivates  it has been said  makes the land his own 
consequently  no more property  this was clearly seen by the old
jurists  who have not failed to denounce this novelty  while on the
other hand the young school hoots at the absurdity of the first occupant
theory  others have presented themselves  pretending to reconcile
the two opinions by uniting them  they have failed  like all the
 juste milieux  of the world  and are laughed at for their eclecticism 
at present  the alarm is in the camp of the old doctrine  from all sides
pour in defences of property  studies regarding property  theories of
property  each one of which  giving the lie to the rest  inflicts a
fresh wound upon property 

consider  indeed  the inextricable embarrassments  the contradictions 
the absurdities  the incredible nonsense  in which the bold defenders of
property so lightly involve themselves  i choose the eclectics  because 
those killed  the others cannot survive 

m  troplong  jurist  passes for a philosopher in the eyes of the editors
of  le droit   i tell the gentlemen of  le droit  that  in the judgment
of philosophers  m  troplong is only an advocate  and i prove my
assertion 

m  troplong is a defender of progress   the words of the code   says he 
 are fruitful sap with which the classic works of the eighteenth century
overflow  to wish to suppress them    is to violate the law of progress 
and to forget that a science which moves is a science which grows    64 


now  the only mutable and progressive portion of law  as we have already
seen  is that which concerns property  if  then  you ask what reforms
are to be introduced into the right of property  m  troplong makes no
reply  what progress is to be hoped for  no reply  what is to be the
destiny of property in case of universal association  no reply  what is
the absolute and what the contingent  what the true and what the false 
in property  no reply  m  troplong favors quiescence and  in statu
quo  in regard to property  what could be more unphilosophical in a
progressive philosopher 

nevertheless  m  troplong has thought about these things   there are  
he says   many weak points and antiquated ideas in the doctrines of
modern authors concerning property  witness the works of mm  toullier
and duranton   the doctrine of m  troplong promises  then  strong
points  advanced and progressive ideas  let us see  let us examine   


 man  placed in the presence of matter  is conscious of a power over it 
which has been given to him to satisfy the needs of his being  king
of inanimate or unintelligent nature  he feels that he has a right to
modify it  govern it  and fit it for his use  there it is  the subject
of property  which is legitimate only when exercised over things  never
when over persons  


m  troplong is so little of a philosopher  that he does not even know
the import of the philosophical terms which he makes a show of using  he
says of matter that it is the subject of property  he should have said
the object  m  troplong uses the language of the anatomists  who apply
the term subject to the human matter used in their experiments 

this error of our author is repeated farther on   liberty  which
overcomes matter  the subject of property  &c   the subject of
property is man  its object is matter  but even this is but a slight
mortification  directly we shall have some crucifixions 

thus  according to the passage just quoted  it is in the conscience and
personality of man that the principle of property must be sought  is
there any thing new in this doctrine  apparently it never has occurred
to those who  since the days of cicero and aristotle  and earlier  have
maintained that things belong to the first occupant  that occupation may
be exercised by beings devoid of conscience and personality  the human
personality  though it may be the principle or the subject of property 
as matter is the object  is not the condition  now  it is this condition
which we most need to know  so far  m  troplong tells us no more than
his masters  and the figures with which he adorns his style add nothing
to the old idea 

property  then  implies three terms  the subject  the object  and the
condition  there is no difficulty in regard to the first two terms  as
to the third  the condition of property down to this day  for the greek
as for the barbarian  has been that of first occupancy  what now would
you have it  progressive doctor 


 when man lays hands for the first time upon an object without a
master  he performs an act which  among individuals  is of the greatest
importance  the thing thus seized and occupied participates  so to
speak  in the personality of him who holds it  it becomes sacred  like
himself  it is impossible to take it without doing violence to his
liberty  or to remove it without rashly invading his person  diogenes
did but express this truth of intuition  when he said   stand out of my
light   


very good  but would the prince of cynics  the very personal and very
haughty diogenes  have had the right to charge another cynic  as rent
for this same place in the sunshine  a bone for twenty four hours of
possession  it is that which constitutes the proprietor  it is that
which you fail to justify  in reasoning from the human personality and
individuality to the right of property  you unconsciously construct
a syllogism in which the conclusion includes more than the premises 
contrary to the rules laid down by aristotle  the individuality of
the human person proves individual possession  originally called
 proprietas   in opposition to collective possession   communio  

it gives birth to the distinction between thine and mine  true signs
of equality  not  by any means  of subordination   from equivocation to
equivocation   says m  michelet   65   property would crawl to the end
of the world  man could not limit it  were not he himself its limit 
where they clash  there will be its frontier   in short  individuality
of being destroys the hypothesis of communism  but it does not for that
reason give birth to domain   that domain by virtue of which the holder
of a thing exercises over the person who takes his place a right of
prestation and suzerainty  that has always been identified with property
itself 



further  that he whose legitimately acquired possession injures nobody
cannot be nonsuited without flagrant injustice  is a truth  not of
intuition  as m  troplong says  but of inward sensation   66  which has
nothing to do with property 


m  troplong admits  then  occupancy as a condition of property  in that 
he is in accord with the roman law  in accord with mm  toullier and
duranton  but in his opinion this condition is not the only one  and it
is in this particular that his doctrine goes beyond theirs 


 but  however exclusive the right arising from sole occupancy  does it
not become still more so  when man has moulded matter by his labor 
when he has deposited in it a portion of himself  re creating it by his
industry  and setting upon it the seal of his intelligence and activity 
of all conquests  that is the most legitimate  for it is the price of
labor 

 he who should deprive a man of the thing thus remodelled  thus
humanized  would invade the man himself  and would inflict the deepest
wounds upon his liberty  


i pass over the very beautiful explanations in which m  troplong 
discussing labor and industry  displays the whole wealth of his
eloquence  m  troplong is not only a philosopher  he is an orator  an
artist  he abounds with appeals to the conscience and the passions  i
might make sad work of his rhetoric  should i undertake to dissect it 
but i confine myself for the present to his philosophy 

if m  troplong had only known how to think and reflect  before
abandoning the original fact of occupancy and plunging into the theory
of labor  he would have asked himself   what is it to occupy   and he
would have discovered that occupancy is only a generic term by which
all modes of possession are expressed   seizure  station  immanence 
habitation  cultivation  use  consumption  &c   that labor 
consequently  is but one of a thousand forms of occupancy  he would have
understood  finally  that the right of possession which is born of labor
is governed by the same general laws as that which results from the
simple seizure of things  what kind of a legist is he who declaims when
he ought to reason  who continually mistakes his metaphors for legal
axioms  and who does not so much as know how to obtain a universal by
induction  and form a category 

if labor is identical with occupancy  the only benefit which it secures
to the laborer is the right of individual possession of the object of
his labor  if it differs from occupancy  it gives birth to a right equal
only to itself   that is  a right which begins  continues  and ends 
with the labor of the occupant  it is for this reason  in the words of
the law  that one cannot acquire a just title to a thing by labor alone 
he must also hold it for a year and a day  in order to be regarded as
its possessor  and possess it twenty or thirty years  in order to become
its proprietor 

these preliminaries established  m  troplong s whole structure falls of
its own weight  and the inferences  which he attempts to draw  vanish 

 property once acquired by occupation and labor  it naturally preserves
itself  not only by the same means  but also by the refusal of the
holder to abdicate  for from the very fact that it has risen to the
height of a right  it is its nature to perpetuate itself and to last for
an indefinite period     rights  considered from an ideal point of
view  are imperishable and eternal  and time  which affects only the
contingent  can no more disturb them than it can injure god himself  
it is astonishing that our author  in speaking of the ideal  time  and
eternity  did not work into his sentence the divine wings of plato   so
fashionable to day in philosophical works 

with the exception of falsehood  i hate nonsense more than any thing
else in the world  property once acquired  good  if it is acquired  but 
as it is not acquired  it cannot be preserved  rights are eternal  yes 
in the sight of god  like the archetypal ideas of the platonists  but 
on the earth  rights exist only in the presence of a subject  an object 
and a condition  take away one of these three things  and rights no
longer exist  thus  individual possession ceases at the death of the
subject  upon the destruction of the object  or in case of exchange or
abandonment 

let us admit  however  with m  troplong  that property is an absolute
and eternal right  which cannot be destroyed save by the deed and at
the will of the proprietor  what are the consequences which immediately
follow from this position 

to show the justice and utility of prescription  m  troplong supposes
the case of a bona fide possessor whom a proprietor  long since
forgotten or even unknown  is attempting to eject from his possession 
 at the start  the error of the possessor was excusable but not
irreparable  pursuing its course and growing old by degrees  it has
so completely clothed itself in the colors of truth  it has spoken
so loudly the language of right  it has involved so many confiding
interests  that it fairly may be asked whether it would not cause
greater confusion to go back to the reality than to sanction the
fictions which it  an error  without doubt  has sown on its way  well 
yes  it must be confessed  without hesitation  that the remedy would
prove worse than the disease  and that its application would lead to the
most outrageous injustice  

how long since utility became a principle of law  when the athenians  by
the advice of aristides  rejected a proposition eminently advantageous
to their republic  but also utterly unjust  they showed finer moral
perception and greater clearness of intellect than m  troplong  property
is an eternal right  independent of time  indestructible except by the
act and at the will of the proprietor  and here this right is taken from
the proprietor  and on what ground  good god  on the ground of absence 
is it not true that legists are governed by caprice in giving and taking
away rights  when it pleases these gentlemen  idleness  unworthiness  or
absence can invalidate a right which  under quite similar circumstances 
labor  residence  and virtue are inadequate to obtain  do not be
astonished that legists reject the absolute  their good pleasure is law 
and their disordered imaginations are the real cause of the evolutions
in jurisprudence 

 if the nominal proprietor should plead ignorance  his claim would be
none the more valid  indeed  his ignorance might arise from inexcusable
carelessness  etc  


what  in order to legitimate dispossession through prescription  you
suppose faults in the proprietor  you blame his absence   which may
have been involuntary  his neglect   not knowing what caused it  his
carelessness   a gratuitous supposition of your own  it is absurd  one
very simple observation suffices to annihilate this theory  society 
which  they tell us  makes an exception in the interest of order in
favor of the possessor as against the old proprietor  owes the latter
an indemnity  since the privilege of prescription is nothing but
expropriation for the sake of public utility 

but here is something stronger   


 in society a place cannot remain vacant with impunity  a new man arises
in place of the old one who disappears or goes away  he brings here his
existence  becomes entirely absorbed  and devotes himself to this post
which he finds abandoned  shall the deserter  then  dispute the honor of
the victory with the soldier who fights with the sweat standing on his
brow  and bears the burden of the day  in behalf of a cause which he
deems just  


when the tongue of an advocate once gets in motion  who can tell where
it will stop  m  troplong admits and justifies usurpation in case of
the absence of the proprietor  and on a mere presumption of his
carelessness  but when the neglect is authenticated  when the
abandonment is solemnly and voluntarily set forth in a contract in the
presence of a magistrate  when the proprietor dares to say   i cease to
labor  but i still claim a share of the product    then the absentee s
right of property is protected  the usurpation of the possessor would
be criminal  farm rent is the reward of idleness  where is  i do not say
the consistency  but  the honesty of this law 

prescription is a result of the civil law  a creation of the legislator 
why has not the legislator fixed the conditions differently   why 
instead of twenty and thirty years  is not a single year sufficient to
prescribe   why are not voluntary absence and confessed idleness as good
grounds for dispossession as involuntary absence  ignorance  or apathy 

but in vain should we ask m  troplong  the philosopher  to tell us
the ground of prescription  concerning the code  m  troplong does not
reason   the interpreter   he says   must take things as they are 
society as it exists  laws as they are made  that is the only sensible
starting point   well  then  write no more books  cease to reproach your
predecessors  who  like you  have aimed only at interpretation of the
law  for having remained in the rear  talk no more of philosophy and
progress  for the lie sticks in your throat 

m  troplong denies the reality of the right of possession  he denies
that possession has ever existed as a principle of society  and he
quotes m  de savigny  who holds precisely the opposite position  and
whom he is content to leave unanswered  at one time  m  troplong asserts
that possession and property are contemporaneous  and that they exist at
the same time  which implies that the right of property is based on the
fact of possession   a conclusion which is evidently absurd  at
another  he denies that possession had any historical existence prior
to property   an assertion which is contradicted by the customs of many
nations which cultivate the land without appropriating it  by the roman
law  which distinguished so clearly between possession and property  and
by our code itself  which makes possession for twenty or thirty years
the condition of property  finally  m  troplong goes so far as to
maintain that the roman maxim   nihil comune habet proprietas cum
possessione   which contains so striking an allusion to the possession
of the  ager publicus   and which  sooner or later  will be again
accepted without qualification  expresses in french law only a judicial
axiom  a simple rule forbidding the union of an  action possessoire 
with an  action petitoire    an opinion as retrogressive as it is
unphilosophical 

in treating of  actions possessoires   m  troplong is so unfortunate or
awkward that he mutilates economy through failure to grasp its
meaning  just as property   he writes   gave rise to the action for
revendication  so possession  the  jus possessionis   was the cause
of possessory interdicts     there were two kinds of interdicts   the
interdict  recuperandae possessionis   and the interdict  retinendae
possessionis    which correspond to our  complainte en cas de saisine
et nouvelete   there is also a third    adipiscendae possessionis    of
which the roman law books speak in connection with the two others 
but  in reality  this interdict is not possessory  for he who wishes
to acquire possession by this means does not possess  and has not
possessed  and yet acquired possession is the condition of possessory
interdicts   why is not an action to acquire possession equally
conceivable with an action to be reinstated in possession  when the
roman plebeians demanded a division of the conquered territory  when
the proletaires of lyons took for their motto   vivre en travaillant  ou
mourir en combattant   to live working  or die fighting   when the most
enlightened of the modern economists claim for every man the right to
labor and to live   they only propose this interdict   adipiscendae
possessionis   which embarrasses m  troplong so seriously  and what is
my object in pleading against property  if not to obtain possession  how
is it that m  troplong  the legist  the orator  the philosopher  does
not see that logically this interdict must be admitted  since it is the
necessary complement of the two others  and the three united form an
indivisible trinity   to recover  to maintain  to acquire  to break this
series is to create a blank  destroy the natural synthesis of things 
and follow the example of the geometrician who tried to conceive of
a solid with only two dimensions  but it is not astonishing that m 
troplong rejects the third class of  actions possessoires   when
we consider that he rejects possession itself  he is so completely
controlled by his prejudices in this respect  that he is unconsciously
led  not to unite  that would be horrible in his eyes   but to identify
the  action possessoire  with the  action petitoire   this could be
easily proved  were it not too tedious to plunge into these metaphysical
obscurities 

as an interpreter of the law  m  troplong is no more successful than
as a philosopher  one specimen of his skill in this direction  and i am
done with him   


code of civil procedure  art  23    actions possessoires  are only when
commenced within the year of trouble by those who have held possession
for at least a year by an irrevocable title  


m  troplong s comments   


 ought we to maintain  as duparc  poullain  and lanjuinais would have
us  the rule  spoliatus ante omnia restituendus   when an individual 
who is neither proprietor nor annual possessor  is expelled by a third
party  who has no right to the estate  i think not  art  23 of the
code is general  it absolutely requires that the plaintiff in  actions
possessoires  shall have been in peaceable possession for a year at
least  that is the invariable principle  it can in no case be modified 
and why should it be set aside  the plaintiff had no seisin  he had no
privileged possession  he had only a temporary occupancy  insufficient
to warrant in his favor the presumption of property  which renders the
annual possession so valuable  well  this  ae facto  occupancy he has
lost  another is invested with it  possession is in the hands of this
new comer  now  is not this a case for the application of the principle 
 in   pari causa possesser potior habetur   should not the actual
possessor be preferred to the evicted possessor  can he not meet the
complaint of his adversary by saying to him   prove that you were an
annual possessor before me  for you are the plaintiff  as far as i am
concerned  it is not for me to tell you how i possess  nor how long
i have possessed   possideo quia possideo   i have no other reply  no
other defence  when you have shown that your action is admissible  then
we will see whether you are entitled to lift the veil which hides the
origin of my possession   


and this is what is honored with the name of jurisprudence and
philosophy   the restoration of force  what  when i have  moulded matter
by my labor   i quote m  troplong   when i have  deposited in it a
portion of myself   m  troplong   when i have  re created it by
my industry  and set upon it the seal of my intelligence   m 
troplong    on the ground that i have not possessed it for a year  a
stranger may dispossess me  and the law offers me no protection  and if
m  troplong is my judge  m  troplong will condemn me  and if i resist
my adversary   if  for this bit of mud which i may call my field  and
of which they wish to rob me  a war breaks out between the two
competitors   the legislator will gravely wait until the stronger 
having killed the other  has had possession for a year  no  no  monsieur
troplong  you do not understand the words of the law  for i prefer
to call in question your intelligence rather than the justice of the
legislator  you are mistaken in your application of the principle   in
pari causa possessor potior habetur   the actuality of possession here
refers to him who possessed at the time when the difficulty arose  not
to him who possesses at the time of the complaint  and when the code
prohibits the reception of  actions possessoires   in cases where the
possession is not of a year s duration  it simply means that if  before
a year has elapsed  the holder relinquishes possession  and ceases
actually to occupy  in propria persona   he cannot avail himself of an
 action possessoire  against his successor  in a word  the code treats
possession of less than a year as it ought to treat all possession 
however long it has existed   that is  the condition of property ought
to be  not merely seisin for a year  but perpetual seisin 

i will not pursue this analysis farther  when an author bases two
volumes of quibbles on foundations so uncertain  it may be boldly
declared that his work  whatever the amount of learning displayed in it 
is a mess of nonsense unworthy a critic s attention 

at this point  sir  i seem to hear you reproaching me for this conceited
dogmatism  this lawless arrogance  which respects nothing  claims a
monopoly of justice and good sense  and assumes to put in the pillory
any one who dares to maintain an opinion contrary to its own  this
fault  they tell me  more odious than any other in an author  was too
prominent a characteristic of my first memoir  and i should do well to
correct it 

it is important to the success of my defence  that i should vindicate
myself from this reproach  and since  while perceiving in myself other
faults of a different character  i still adhere in this particular to
my disputatious style  it is right that i should give my reasons for my
conduct  i act  not from inclination  but from necessity 

i say  then  that i treat my authors as i do for two reasons  a reason
of right  and a reason of intention  both peremptory 

1  reason of right  when i preach equality of fortunes  i do not advance
an opinion more or less probable  a utopia more or less ingenious  an
idea conceived within my brain by means of imagination only  i lay down
an absolute truth  concerning which hesitation is impossible  modesty
superfluous  and doubt ridiculous 

but  do you ask  what assures me that that which i utter is true 

what assures me  sir  the logical and metaphysical processes which i
use  the correctness of which i have demonstrated by a priori reasoning 
the fact that i possess an infallible method of investigation and
verification with which my authors are unacquainted  and finally  the
fact that for all matters relating to property and justice i have found
a formula which explains all legislative variations  and furnishes a
key for all problems  now  is there so much as a shadow of method in m 
toullier  m  troplong  and this swarm of insipid commentators  almost
as devoid of reason and moral sense as the code itself  do you give the
name of method to an alphabetical  chronological  analogical  or merely
nominal classification of subjects  do you give the name of method
to these lists of paragraphs gathered under an arbitrary head  these
sophistical vagaries  this mass of contradictory quotations and
opinions  this nauseous style  this spasmodic rhetoric  models of which
are so common at the bar  though seldom found elsewhere  do you take for
philosophy this twaddle  this intolerable pettifoggery adorned with a
few scholastic trimmings  no  no  a writer who respects himself  never
will consent to enter the balance with these manipulators of law 
misnamed jurists  and for my part i object to a comparison 

2  reason of intention  as far as i am permitted to divulge this secret 
i am a conspirator in an immense revolution  terrible to charlatans and
despots  to all exploiters of the poor and credulous  to all salaried
idlers  dealers in political panaceas and parables  tyrants in a word of
thought and of opinion  i labor to stir up the reason of individuals to
insurrection against the reason of authorities 


according to the laws of the society of which i am a member  all the
evils which afflict humanity arise from faith in external teachings and
submission to authority  and not to go outside of our own century  is
it not true  for instance  that france is plundered  scoffed at  and
tyrannized over  because she speaks in masses  and not by heads  the
french people are penned up in three or four flocks  receiving their
signal from a chief  responding to the voice of a leader  and thinking
just as he says  a certain journal  it is said  has fifty thousand
subscribers  assuming six readers to every subscriber  we have three
hundred thousand sheep browsing and bleating at the same cratch  apply
this calculation to the whole periodical press  and you find that  in
our free and intelligent france  there are two millions of creatures
receiving every morning from the journals spiritual pasturage  two
millions  in other words  the entire nation allows a score of little
fellows to lead it by the nose 

by no means  sir  do i deny to journalists talent  science  love
of truth  patriotism  and what you please  they are very worthy and
intelligent people  whom i undoubtedly should wish to resemble  had i
the honor to know them  that of which i complain  and that which has
made me a conspirator  is that  instead of enlightening us  these
gentlemen command us  impose upon us articles of faith  and that without
demonstration or verification  when  for example  i ask why these
fortifications of paris  which  in former times  under the influence
of certain prejudices  and by means of a concurrence of extraordinary
circumstances supposed for the sake of the argument to have existed  may
perhaps have served to protect us  but which it is doubtful whether
our descendants will ever use   when i ask  i say  on what grounds they
assimilate the future to a hypothetical past  they reply that m 
thiers  who has a great mind  has written upon this subject a report of
admirable elegance and marvellous clearness  at this i become angry  and
reply that m  thiers does not know what he is talking about  why  having
wanted no detached forts seven years ago  do we want them to day 

 oh  damn it   they say   the difference is great  the first forts
were too near to us  with these we cannot be bombarded   you cannot be
bombarded  but you can be blockaded  and will be  if you stir  what  to
obtain blockade forts from the parisians  it has sufficed to prejudice
them against bombardment forts  and they thought to outwit the
government  oh  the sovereignty of the people    


 damn it  m  thiers  who is wiser than you  says that it would be absurd
to suppose a government making war upon citizens  and maintaining itself
by force and in spite of the will of the people  that would be absurd  
perhaps so  such a thing has happened more than once  and may happen
again  besides  when despotism is strong  it appears almost legitimate 
however that may be  they lied in 1833  and they lie again in
1841   those who threaten us with the bomb shell  and then  if m  thiers
is so well assured of the intentions of the government  why does he not
wish the forts to be built before the circuit is extended  why this
air of suspicion of the government  unless an intrigue has been planned
between the government and m  thiers 

 damn it  we do not wish to be again invaded  if paris had been
fortified in 1815  napoleon would not have been conquered   but i tell
you that napoleon was not conquered  but sold  and that if  in 1815 
paris had had fortifications  it would have been with them as with the
thirty thousand men of grouchy  who were misled during the battle  it is
still easier to surrender forts than to lead soldiers  would the selfish
and the cowardly ever lack reasons for yielding to the enemy 

 but do you not see that the absolutist courts are provoked at our
fortifications   a proof that they do not think as you do   you believe
that  and  for my part  i believe that in reality they are quite at ease
about the matter  and  if they appear to tease our ministers  they do so
only to give the latter an opportunity to decline  the absolutist courts
are always on better terms with our constitutional monarchy  than
our monarchy with us  does not m  guizot say that france needs to
be defended within as well as without  within  against whom  against
france  o parisians  it is but six months since you demanded war  and
now you want only barricades  why should the allies fear your doctrines 
when you cannot even control yourselves     how could you sustain a
siege  when you weep over the absence of an actress 

 but  finally  do you not understand that  by the rules of modern
warfare  the capital of a country is always the objective point of its
assailants  suppose our army defeated on the rhine  france invaded  and
defenceless paris falling into the hands of the enemy  it would be the
death of the administrative power  without a head it could not live  the
capital taken  the nation must submit  what do you say to that  

the reply is very simple  why is society constituted in such a way that
the destiny of the country depends upon the safety of the capital 
why  in case our territory be invaded and paris besieged  cannot the
legislative  executive  and military powers act outside of paris  why
this localization of all the vital forces of france     do not cry out
upon decentralization  this hackneyed reproach would discredit only
your own intelligence and sincerity  it is not a question of
decentralization  it is your political fetichism which i attack  why
should the national unity be attached to a certain place  to certain
functionaries  to certain bayonets  why should the place maubert and the
palace of the tuileries be the palladium of france 

now let me make an hypothesis 

suppose it were written in the charter   in case the country be again
invaded  and paris forced to surrender  the government being annihilated
and the national assembly dissolved  the electoral colleges shall
reassemble spontaneously and without other official notice  for the
purpose of appointing new deputies  who shall organize a provisional
government at orleans 

 if orleans succumbs  the government shall reconstruct itself in the same
way at lyons  then at bordeaux  then at bayonne  until all france be
captured or the enemy driven from the land  for the government may
perish  but the nation never dies  the king  the peers  and the deputies
massacred  vive la france  

do you not think that such an addition to the charter would be a better
safeguard for the liberty and integrity of the country than walls and
bastions around paris  well  then  do henceforth for administration 
industry  science  literature  and art that which the charter ought
to prescribe for the central government and common defence  instead of
endeavoring to render paris impregnable  try rather to render the loss
of paris an insignificant matter  instead of accumulating about one
point academies  faculties  schools  and political  administrative 
and judicial centres  instead of arresting intellectual development
and weakening public spirit in the provinces by this fatal
agglomeration   can you not  without destroying unity  distribute social
functions among places as well as among persons  such a system  in
allowing each province to participate in political power and action  and
in balancing industry  intelligence  and strength in all parts of the
country  would equally secure  against enemies at home and enemies
abroad  the liberty of the people and the stability of the government 

discriminate  then  between the centralization of functions and the
concentration of organs  between political unity and its material
symbol 

 oh  that is plausible  but it is impossible    which means that the
city of paris does not intend to surrender its privileges  and that
there it is still a question of property 

idle talk  the country  in a state of panic which has been cleverly
worked upon  has asked for fortifications  i dare to affirm that it
has abdicated its sovereignty  all parties are to blame for this
suicide   the conservatives  by their acquiescence in the plans of the
government  the friends of the dynasty  because they wish no opposition
to that which pleases them  and because a popular revolution would
annihilate them  the democrats  because they hope to rule in their turn 
 67  that which all rejoice at having obtained is a means of future
repression  as for the defence of the country  they are not troubled
about that  the idea of tyranny dwells in the minds of all  and brings
together into one conspiracy all forms of selfishness  we wish the
regeneration of society  but we subordinate this desire to our ideas
and convenience  that our approaching marriage may take place  that our
business may succeed  that our opinions may triumph  we postpone reform 
intolerance and selfishness lead us to put fetters upon liberty  and 
because we cannot wish all that god wishes  we would  if it rested with
us  stay the course of destiny rather than sacrifice our own interests
and self love  is not this an instance where the words of solomon
apply     l iniquite a menti a elle meme   


it is said that on this question of the fortification of paris the staff
of  le national  are not agreed  this would prove  if proof were needed 
that a journal may blunder and falsify  without entitling any one to
accuse its editors  a journal is a metaphysical being  for which no one
is really responsible  and which owes its existence solely to mutual
concessions  this idea ought to frighten those worthy citizens who 
because they borrow their opinions from a journal  imagine that they
belong to a political party  and who have not the faintest suspicion
that they are really without a head 


for this reason  sir  i have enlisted in a desperate war against
every form of authority over the multitude  advance sentinel of the
proletariat  i cross bayonets with the celebrities of the day  as
well as with spies and charlatans  well  when i am fighting with an
illustrious adversary  must i stop at the end of every phrase  like
an orator in the tribune  to say  the learned author    the eloquent
writer    the profound publicist   and a hundred other platitudes with
which it is fashionable to mock people  these civilities seem to me no
less insulting to the man attacked than dishonorable to the aggressor 
but when  rebuking an author  i say to him   citizen  your doctrine is
absurd  and  if to prove my assertion is an offence against you  i
am guilty of it   immediately the listener opens his ears  he is all
attention  and  if i do not succeed in convincing him  at least i give
his thought an impulse  and set him the wholesome example of doubt and
free examination 

then do not think  sir  that  in tripping up the philosophy of your very
learned and very estimable confrere  m  troplong  i fail to appreciate
his talent as a writer  in my opinion  he has too much for a jurist  
nor his knowledge  though it is too closely confined to the letter of
the law  and the reading of old books  in these particulars  m  troplong
offends on the side of excess rather than deficiency  further  do not
believe that i am actuated by any personal animosity towards him  or
that i have the slightest desire to wound his self love  i know m 
troplong only by his  treatise on prescription   which i wish he had not
written  and as for my critics  neither m  troplong  nor any of those
whose opinion i value  will ever read me  once more  my only object is
to prove  as far as i am able  to this unhappy french nation  that
those who make the laws  as well as those who interpret them  are not
infallible organs of general  impersonal  and absolute reason 

i had resolved to submit to a systematic criticism the semi official
defence of the right of property recently put forth by m  wolowski 
your colleague at the conservatory  with this view  i had commenced
to collect the documents necessary for each of his lectures  but  soon
perceiving that the ideas of the professor were incoherent  that his
arguments contradicted each other  that one affirmation was sure to be
overthrown by another  and that in m  wolowski s lucubrations the
good was always mingled with the bad  and being by nature a little
suspicious  it suddenly occurred to me that m  wolowski was an advocate
of equality in disguise  thrown in spite of himself into the position
in which the patriarch jacob pictures one of his sons    inter
duas clitellas   between two stools  as the proverb says  in more
parliamentary language  i saw clearly that m  wolowski was placed
between his profound convictions on the one hand and his official duties
on the other  and that  in order to maintain his position  he had to
assume a certain slant  then i experienced great pain at seeing the
reserve  the circumlocution  the figures  and the irony to which
a professor of legislation  whose duty it is to teach dogmas with
clearness and precision  was forced to resort  and i fell to cursing
the society in which an honest man is not allowed to say frankly what he
thinks  never  sir  have you conceived of such torture  i seemed to be
witnessing the martyrdom of a mind  i am going to give you an idea of
these astonishing meetings  or rather of these scenes of sorrow 

monday  nov  20  1840   the professor declares  in brief   1  that the
right of property is not founded upon occupation  but upon the impress
of man  2  that every man has a natural and inalienable right to the use
of matter 

now  if matter can be appropriated  and if  notwithstanding  all
men retain an inalienable right to the use of this matter  what is
property   and if matter can be appropriated only by labor  how long
is this appropriation to continue   questions that will confuse and
confound all jurists whatsoever 

then m  wolowski cites his authorities  great god  what witnesses he
brings forward  first  m  troplong  the great metaphysician  whom we
have discussed  then  m  louis blanc  editor of the  revue du progres  
who came near being tried by jury for publishing his  organization of
labor   and who escaped from the clutches of the public prosecutor only
by a juggler s trick   68  corinne   i mean madame de stael   who  in
an ode  making a poetical comparison of the land with the waves  of the
furrow of a plough with the wake of a vessel  says  that property exists
only where man has left his trace   which makes property dependent
upon the solidity of the elements  rousseau  the apostle of liberty and
equality  but who  according to m  wolowski  attacked property only as
a joke  and in order to point a paradox  robespierre  who prohibited
a division of the land  because he regarded such a measure as a
rejuvenescence of property  and who  while awaiting the definitive
organization of the republic  placed all property in the care   of
the people   that is  transferred the right of eminent domain from the
individual to society  babeuf  who wanted property for the nation  and
communism for the citizens  m  considerant  who favors a division of
landed property into shares   that is  who wishes to render property
nominal and fictitious  the whole being intermingled with jokes and
witticisms  intended undoubtedly to lead people away from the hornets 
nests  at the expense of the adversaries of the right of property 


november 26   m  wolowski supposes this objection  land  like
water  air  and light  is necessary to life  therefore it cannot
be appropriated  and he replies  the importance of landed property
diminishes as the power of industry increases 

good  this importance diminishes  but it does not disappear  and this 
of itself  shows landed property to be illegitimate  here m  wolowski
pretends to think that the opponents of property refer only to property
in land  while they merely take it as a term of comparison  and  in
showing with wonderful clearness the absurdity of the position in which
he places them  he finds a way of drawing the attention of his hearers
to another subject without being false to the truth which it is his
office to contradict 

 property   says m  wolowski   is that which distinguishes man from the
animals   that may be  but are we to regard this as a compliment or a
satire 

 mahomet   says m  wolowski   decreed property   and so did genghis
khan  and tamerlane  and all the ravagers of nations  what sort of
legislators were they 

 property has been in existence ever since the origin of the human
race   yes  and so has slavery  and despotism also  and likewise
polygamy and idolatry  but what does this antiquity show 

the members of the council of the state  m  portalis at their head  did
not raise  in their discussion of the code  the question of the
legitimacy of property   their silence   says m  wolowski   is a
precedent in favor of this right   i may regard this reply as personally
addressed to me  since the observation belongs to me  i reply   as long
as an opinion is universally admitted  the universality of belief serves
of itself as argument and proof  when this same opinion is attacked 
the former faith proves nothing  we must resort to reason  ignorance 
however old and pardonable it may be  never outweighs reason  

property has its abuses  m  wolowski confesses   but   he says   these
abuses gradually disappear  to day their cause is known  they all arise
from a false theory of property  in principle  property is inviolable 
but it can and must be checked and disciplined   such are the
conclusions of the professor 

when one thus remains in the clouds  he need not fear to equivocate 
nevertheless  i would like him to define these abuses of property  to
show their cause  to explain this true theory from which no abuse is to
spring  in short  to tell me how  without destroying property  it can
be governed for the greatest good of all   our civil code   says m 
wolowski  in speaking of this subject   leaves much to be desired   i
think it leaves every thing undone 

finally  m  wolowski opposes  on the one hand  the concentration of
capital  and the absorption which results therefrom  and  on the other 
he objects to the extreme division of the land  now i think that i have
demonstrated in my first memoir  that large accumulation and minute
division are the first two terms of an economical trinity   a thesis and
an antithesis  but  while m  wolowski says nothing of the third term 
the synthesis  and thus leaves the inference in suspense  i have shown
that this third term is association  which is the annihilation of
property 

november 30   literary property  m  wolowski grants that it is just to
recognize the rights of talent  which is not in the least hostile to
equality   but he seriously objects to perpetual and absolute property
in the works of genius  to the profit of the authors  heirs  his main
argument is  that society has a right of collective production over
every creation of the mind  now  it is precisely this principle of
collective power that i developed in my  inquiries into property and
government   and on which i have established the complete edifice of
a new social organization  m  wolowski is  as far as i know  the first
jurist who has made a legislative application of this economical law 
only  while i have extended the principle of collective power to every
sort of product  m  wolowski  more prudent than it is my nature to be 
confines it to neutral ground  so  that that which i am bold enough
to say of the whole  he is contented to affirm of a part  leaving
the intelligent hearer to fill up the void for himself  however  his
arguments are keen and close  one feels that the professor  finding
himself more at ease with one aspect of property  has given the rein to
his intellect  and is rushing on towards liberty 

1  absolute literary property would hinder the activity of other men 
and obstruct the development of humanity  it would be the death of
progress  it would be suicide  what would have happened if the
first inventions   the plough  the level  the saw  &c    had been
appropriated 

such is the first proposition of m  wolowski 

i reply  absolute property in land and tools hinders human activity  and
obstructs progress and the free development of man 

what happened in rome  and in all the ancient nations  what occurred
in the middle ages  what do we see to day in england  in consequence of
absolute property in the sources of production 

the suicide of humanity 

2  real and personal property is in harmony with the social interest 
in consequence of literary property  social and individual interests are
perpetually in conflict 

the statement of this proposition contains a rhetorical figure  common
with those who do not enjoy full and complete liberty of speech  this
figure is the  anti phrasis  or  contre verite   it consists  according
to dumarsais and the best humanists  in saying one thing while meaning
another  m  wolowski s proposition  naturally expressed  would read as
follows   just as real and personal property is essentially hostile to
society  so  in consequence of literary property  social and individual
interests are perpetually in conflict  

3  m  de montalembert  in the chamber of peers  vehemently protested
against the assimilation of authors to inventors of machinery  an
assimilation which he claimed to be injurious to the former  m  wolowski
replies  that the rights of authors  without machinery  would be nil 
that  without paper mills  type foundries  and printing offices 
there could be no sale of verse and prose  that many a mechanical
invention   the compass  for instance  the telescope  or the
steam engine   is quite as valuable as a book 

prior to m  montalembert  m  charles comte had laughed at the inference
in favor of mechanical inventions  which logical minds never fail to
draw from the privileges granted to authors   he   says m  comte   who
first conceived and executed the idea of transforming a piece of wood
into a pair of sabots  or an animal s hide into a pair of sandals  would
thereby have acquired an exclusive right to make shoes for the human
race   undoubtedly  under the system of property  for  in fact  this
pair of sabots  over which you make so merry  is the creation of the
shoemaker  the work of his genius  the expression of his thought  to him
it is his poem  quite as much as  le roi s amuse   is m  victor hugo s
drama  justice for all alike  if you refuse a patent to a perfecter of
boots  refuse also a privilege to a maker of rhymes 

4  that which gives importance to a book is a fact external to the
author and his work  without the intelligence of society  without its
development  and a certain community of ideas  passions  and interests
between it and the authors  the works of the latter would be worth
nothing  the exchangeable value of a book is due even more to the social
condition than to the talent displayed in it 

indeed  it seems as if i were copying my own words  this proposition
of m  wolowski contains a special expression of a general and absolute
idea  one of the strongest and most conclusive against the right of
property  why do artists  like mechanics  find the means to live 
because society has made the fine arts  like the rudest industries 
objects of consumption and exchange  governed consequently by all the
laws of commerce and political economy  now  the first of these laws is
the equipoise of functions  that is  the equality of associates 

5  m  wolowski indulges in sarcasm against the petitioners for literary
property   there are authors   he says   who crave the privileges of
authors  and who for that purpose point out the power of the melodrama 
they speak of the niece of corneille  begging at the door of a theatre
which the works of her uncle had enriched     to satisfy the avarice of
literary people  it would be necessary to create literary majorats  and
make a whole code of exceptions  

i like this virtuous irony  but m  wolowski has by no means exhausted
the difficulties which the question involves  and first  is it just that
mm  cousin  guizot  villemain  damiron  and company  paid by the state
for delivering lectures  should be paid a second time through the
booksellers   that i  who have the right to report their lectures 
should not have the right to print them  is it just that mm  noel and
chapsal  overseers of the university  should use their influence in
selling their selections from literature to the youth whose studies they
are instructed to superintend in consideration of a salary  and  if
that is not just  is it not proper to refuse literary property to every
author holding public offices  and receiving pensions or sinecures 

again  shall the privilege of the author extend to irreligious and
immoral works  calculated only to corrupt the heart  and obscure the
understanding  to grant this privilege is to sanction immorality by law 
to refuse it is to censure the author  and since it is impossible  in
the present imperfect state of society  to prevent all violations of the
moral law  it will be necessary to open a license office for books as
well as morals  but  then  three fourths of our literary people will
be obliged to register  and  recognized thenceforth on their own
declaration as prostitutes  they will necessarily belong to the public 
we pay toll to the prostitute  we do not endow her 

finally  shall plagiarism be classed with forgery  if you reply  yes  
you appropriate in advance all the subjects of which books treat  if
you say  no   you leave the whole matter to the decision of the judge 
except in the case of a clandestine reprint  how will he distinguish
forgery from quotation  imitation  plagiarism  or even coincidence  a
savant spends two years in calculating a table of logarithms to nine
or ten decimals  he prints it  a fortnight after his book is selling
at half price  it is impossible to tell whether this result is due to
forgery or competition  what shall the court do  in case of doubt  shall
it award the property to the first occupant  as well decide the question
by lot 

these  however  are trifling considerations  but do we see that  in
granting a perpetual privilege to authors and their heirs  we really
strike a fatal blow at their interests  we think to make booksellers
dependent upon authors   a delusion  the booksellers will unite against
works  and their proprietors  against works  by refusing to push their
sale  by replacing them with poor imitations  by reproducing them in
a hundred indirect ways  and no one knows how far the science of
plagiarism  and skilful imitation may be carried  against proprietors 
are we ignorant of the fact  that a demand for a dozen copies enables a
bookseller to sell a thousand  that with an edition of five hundred he
can supply a kingdom for thirty years  what will the poor authors do in
the presence of this omnipotent union of booksellers  i will tell them
what they will do  they will enter the employ of those whom they now
treat as pirates  and  to secure an advantage  they will become wage
laborers  a fit reward for ignoble avarice  and insatiable pride   69 

contradictions of contradictions   genius is the great leveller of the
world   cries m  de lamartine   then genius should be a proprietor 
literary property is the fortune of democracy   this unfortunate
poet thinks himself profound when he is only puffed up  his eloquence
consists solely in coupling ideas which clash with each other  round
square  dark sun  fallen angel  priest and love  thought and poetry 
gunius        and fortune  leveling and property  let us tell him  in
reply  that his mind is a dark luminary  that each of his discourses is
a disordered harmony  and that all his successes  whether in verse or
prose  are due to the use of the extraordinary in the treatment of the
most ordinary subjects 

 le national   in reply to the report of m  lamartine  endeavors to
prove that literary property is of quite a different nature from landed
property  as if the nature of the right of property depended on the
object to which it is applied  and not on the mode of its exercise and
the condition of its existence  but the main object of  le national 
is to please a class of proprietors whom an extension of the right of
property vexes  that is why  le national  opposes literary property 
will it tell us  once for all  whether it is for equality or against it 


6  objection   property in occupied land passes to the heirs of the
occupant   why   say the authors   should not the work of genius pass
in like manner to the heirs of the man of genius   m  wolowski s reply 
 because the labor of the first occupant is continued by his heirs 
while the heirs of an author neither change nor add to his works  in
landed property  the continuance of labor explains the continuance of
the right  

yes  when the labor is continued  but if the labor is not continued 
the right ceases  thus is the right of possession  founded on personal
labor  recognized by m  wolowski 

m  wolowski decides in favor of granting to authors property in their
works for a certain number of years  dating from the day of their first
publication 

the succeeding lectures on patents on inventions were no less
instructive  although intermingled with shocking contradictions inserted
with a view to make the useful truths more palatable  the necessity
for brevity compels me to terminate this examination here  not without
regret 

thus  of two eclectic jurists  who attempt a defence of property  one
is entangled in a set of dogmas without principle or method  and is
constantly talking nonsense  and the other designedly abandons the
cause of property  in order to present under the same name the theory
of individual possession  was i wrong in claiming that confusion reigned
among legists  and ought i to be legally prosecuted for having said
that their science henceforth stood convicted of falsehood  its glory
eclipsed 

the ordinary resources of the law no longer sufficing  philosophy 
political economy  and the framers of systems have been consulted  all
the oracles appealed to have been discouraging 

the philosophers are no clearer to day than at the time of the eclectic
efflorescence  nevertheless  through their mystical apothegms  we
can distinguish the words progress  unity  association  solidarity 
fraternity  which are certainly not reassuring to proprietors  one of
these philosophers  m  pierre leroux  has written two large books  in
which he claims to show by all religious  legislative  and philosophical
systems that  since men are responsible to each other  equality of
conditions is the final law of society  it is true that this philosopher
admits a kind of property  but as he leaves us to imagine what property
would become in presence of equality  we may boldly class him with the
opponents of the right of increase 

i must here declare freely  in order that i may not be suspected of
secret connivance  which is foreign to my nature  that m  leroux has
my full sympathy  not that i am a believer in his quasi pythagorean
philosophy  upon this subject i should have more than one observation to
submit to him  provided a veteran covered with stripes would not despise
the remarks of a conscript   not that i feel bound to this author by any
special consideration for his opposition to property  in my opinion  m 
leroux could  and even ought to  state his position more explicitly and
logically  but i like  i admire  in m  leroux  the antagonist of our
philosophical demigods  the demolisher of usurped reputations  the
pitiless critic of every thing that is respected because of its
antiquity  such is the reason for my high esteem of m  leroux  such
would be the principle of the only literary association which  in this
century of coteries  i should care to form  we need men who  like
m  leroux  call in question social principles   not to diffuse doubt
concerning them  but to make them doubly sure  men who excite the mind
by bold negations  and make the conscience tremble by doctrines of
annihilation  where is the man who does not shudder on hearing m  leroux
exclaim   there is neither a paradise nor a hell  the wicked will not
be punished  nor the good rewarded  mortals  cease to hope and fear  you
revolve in a circle of appearances  humanity is an immortal tree  whose
branches  withering one after another  feed with their debris the root
which is always young   where is the man who  on hearing this desolate
confession of faith  does not demand with terror   is it then true that
i am only an aggregate of elements organized by an unknown force  an
idea realized for a few moments  a form which passes and disappears  is
it true that my mind is only a harmony  and my soul a vortex  what is
the ego  what is god  what is the sanction of society  

in former times  m  leroux would have been regarded as a great culprit 
worthy only  like vanini  of death and universal execration  to day  m 
leroux is fulfilling a mission of salvation  for which  whatever he
may say  he will be rewarded  like those gloomy invalids who are always
talking of their approaching death  and who faint when the doctor s
opinion confirms their pretence  our materialistic society is agitated
and loses countenance while listening to this startling decree of the
philosopher   thou shalt die   honor then to m  leroux  who has revealed
to us the cowardice of the epicureans  to m  leroux  who renders new
philosophical solutions necessary  honor to the anti eclectic  to the
apostle of equality 

in his work on  humanity   m  leroux commences by positing the necessity
of property   you wish to abolish property  but do you not see that
thereby you would annihilate man and even the name of man     you wish
to abolish property  but could you live without a body  i will not tell
you that it is necessary to support this body     i will tell you that
this body is itself a species of property  

in order clearly to understand the doctrine of m  leroux  it must be
borne in mind that there are three necessary and primitive forms of
society   communism  property  and that which to day we properly call
association  m  leroux rejects in the first place communism  and combats
it with all his might  man is a personal and free being  and therefore
needs a sphere of independence and individual activity  m  leroux
emphasizes this in adding   you wish neither family  nor country  nor
property  therefore no more fathers  no more sons  no more brothers 
here you are  related to no being in time  and therefore without a name 
here you are  alone in the midst of a billion of men who to day inhabit
the earth  how do you expect me to distinguish you in space in the midst
of this multitude  

if man is indistinguishable  he is nothing  now  he can be
distinguished  individualized  only through a devotion of certain things
to his use   such as his body  his faculties  and the tools which he
uses   hence   says m  leroux   the necessity of appropriation   in
short  property 

but property on what condition  here m  leroux  after having condemned
communism  denounces in its turn the right of domain  his whole doctrine
can be summed up in this single proposition    man may be made by
property a slave or a despot by turns  

that posited  if we ask m  leroux to tell us under what system of
property man will be neither a slave nor a despot  but free  just  and
a citizen  m  leroux replies in the third volume of his work on
 humanity    


 there are three ways of destroying man s communion with his fellows and
with the universe     1  by separating man in time  2  by separating him
in space  3  by dividing the land  or  in general terms  the instruments
of production  by attaching men to things  by subordinating man to
property  by making man a proprietor  


this language  it must be confessed  savors a little too strongly of the
metaphysical heights which the author frequents  and of the school of
m  cousin  nevertheless  it can be seen  clearly enough it seems to me 
that m  leroux opposes the exclusive appropriation of the instruments of
production  only he calls this non appropriation of the instruments of
production a new method of establishing property  while i  in accordance
with all precedent  call it a destruction of property  in fact  without
the appropriation of instruments  property is nothing 


 hitherto  we have confined ourselves to pointing out and combating the
despotic features of property  by considering property alone  we have
failed to see that the despotism of property is a correlative of the
division of the human race     that property  instead of being organized
in such a way as to facilitate the unlimited communion of man with his
fellows and with the universe  has been  on the contrary  turned against
this communion  

let us translate this into commercial phraseology  in order to destroy
despotism and the inequality of conditions  men must cease from
competition and must associate their interests  let employer and
employed  now enemies and rivals  become associates 

now  ask any manufacturer  merchant  or capitalist  whether he would
consider himself a proprietor if he were to share his revenue and
profits with this mass of wage laborers whom it is proposed to make his
associates 


 family  property  and country are finite things  which ought to be
organized with a view to the infinite  for man is a finite being 
who aspires to the infinite  to him  absolute finiteness is evil  the
infinite is his aim  the indefinite his right  


few of my readers would understand these hierophantic words  were i to
leave them unexplained  m  leroux means  by this magnificent formula 
that humanity is a single immense society  which  in its collective
unity  represents the infinite  that every nation  every tribe  every
commune  and every citizen are  in different degrees  fragments or
finite members of the infinite society  the evil in which results
solely from individualism and privilege   in other words  from the
subordination of the infinite to the finite  finally  that  to attain
humanity s end and aim  each part has a right to an indefinitely
progressive development 


 all the evils which afflict the human race arise from caste  the family
is a blessing  the family caste  the nobility  is an evil  country is
a blessing  the country caste  supreme  domineering  conquering  is an
evil  property  individual possession  is a blessing  the property
caste  the domain of property of pothier  toullier  troplong  &c   is an
evil  


thus  according to m  leroux  there is property and property   the one
good  the other bad  now  as it is proper to call different things by
different names  if we keep the name  property  for the former  we must
call the latter robbery  rapine  brigandage  if  on the contrary  we
reserve the name  property  for the latter  we must designate the former
by the term possession  or some other equivalent  otherwise we should be
troubled with an unpleasant synonymy 

what a blessing it would be if philosophers  daring for once to say all
that they think  would speak the language of ordinary mortals  nations
and rulers would derive much greater profit from their lectures  and 
applying the same names to the same ideas  would come  perhaps  to
understand each other  i boldly declare that  in regard to property  i
hold no other opinion than that of m  leroux  but  if i should adopt the
style of the philosopher  and repeat after him   property is a blessing 
but the property caste  the  statu quo  of property  is an evil   i
should be extolled as a genius by all the bachelors who write for the
reviews   70  if  on the contrary  i prefer the classic language of rome
and the civil code  and say accordingly   possession is a blessing  but
property is robbery   immediately the aforesaid bachelors raise a hue
and cry against the monster  and the judge threatens me  oh  the power
of language 

 le national   on the other hand  has laughed at m  leroux and his ideas
on property  charging him with tautology and childishness   le national 
does not wish to understand  is it necessary to remind this journal that
it has no right to deride a dogmatic philosopher  because it is without
a doctrine itself  from its foundation   le national  has been a nursery
of intriguers and renegades  from time to time it takes care to warn its
readers  instead of lamenting over all its defections  the democratic
sheet would do better to lay the blame on itself  and confess the
shallowness of its theories  when will this organ of popular interests
and the electoral reform cease to hire sceptics and spread doubt  i will
wager  without going further  that m  leon durocher  the critic of m 
leroux  is an anonymous or pseudonymous editor of some bourgeois  or
even aristocratic  journal 


the economists  questioned in their turn  propose to associate capital
and labor  you know  sir  what that means  if we follow out the
doctrine  we soon find that it ends in an absorption of property  not by
the community  but by a general and indissoluble commandite  so that
the condition of the proprietor would differ from that of the workingman
only in receiving larger wages  this system  with some peculiar
additions and embellishments  is the idea of the phalanstery  but it
is clear that  if inequality of conditions is one of the attributes of
property  it is not the whole of property  that which makes property a
delightful thing  as some philosopher  i know not who  has said  is
the power to dispose at will  not only of one s own goods  but of their
specific nature  to use them at pleasure  to confine and enclose them 
to excommunicate mankind  as m  pierre leroux says  in short  to make
such use of them as passion  interest  or even caprice  may suggest 
what is the possession of money  a share in an agricultural or
industrial enterprise  or a government bond coupon  in comparison with
the infinite charm of being master of one s house and grounds  under
one s vine and fig tree    beati possidentes    says an author quoted by
m  troplong  seriously  can that be applied to a man of income  who has
no other possession under the sun than the market  and in his pocket
his money  as well maintain that a trough is a coward  a nice method of
reform  they never cease to condemn the thirst for gold  and the
growing individualism of the century  and yet  most inconceivable
of contradictions  they prepare to turn all kinds of property into
one   property in coin 

i must say something further of a theory of property lately put forth
with some ado  i mean the theory of m  considerant 

the fourierists are not men who examine a doctrine in order to ascertain
whether it conflicts with their system  on the contrary  it is their
custom to exult and sing songs of triumph whenever an adversary passes
without perceiving or noticing them 

these gentlemen want direct refutations  in order that  if they are
beaten  they may have  at least  the selfish consolation of having been
spoken of  well  let their wish be gratified 

m  considerant makes the most lofty pretensions to logic  his method
of procedure is always that of major  minor  and conclusion  he would
willingly write upon his hat    argumentator in barbara    but m 
considerant is too intelligent and quick witted to be a good logician 
as is proved by the fact that he appears to have taken the syllogism for
logic 

the syllogism  as everybody knows who is interested in philosophical
curiosities  is the first and perpetual sophism of the human mind   the
favorite tool of falsehood  the stumbling block of science  the advocate
of crime  the syllogism has produced all the evils which the fabulist
so eloquently condemned  and has done nothing good or useful  it is
as devoid of truth as of justice  we might apply to it these words of
scripture    celui qui met en lui sa confiance  perira    consequently 
the best philosophers long since condemned it  so that now none but the
enemies of reason wish to make the syllogism its weapon 

m  considerant  then  has built his theory of property upon a syllogism 
would he be disposed to stake the system of fourier upon his arguments 
as i am ready to risk the whole doctrine of equality upon my refutation
of that system  such a duel would be quite in keeping with the warlike
and chivalric tastes of m  considerant  and the public would profit by
it  for  one of the two adversaries falling  no more would be said about
him  and there would be one grumbler less in the world 

the theory of m  considerant has this remarkable feature  that  in
attempting to satisfy at the same time the claims of both laborers and
proprietors  it infringes alike upon the rights of the former and the
privileges of the latter  in the first place  the author lays it down as
a principle   1  that the use of the land belongs to each member of the
race  that it is a natural and imprescriptible right  similar in all
respects to the right to the air and the sunshine  2  that the right
to labor is equally fundamental  natural  and imprescriptible   i have
shown that the recognition of this double right would be the death of
property  i denounce m  considerant to the proprietors 

but m  considerant maintains that the right to labor creates the right
of property  and this is the way he reasons   


major premise    every man legitimately possesses the thing which his
labor  his skill   or  in more general terms  his action   has created  


to which m  considerant adds  by way of comment   indeed  the land not
having been created by man  it follows from the fundamental principle
of property  that the land  being given to the race in common  can in
no wise be the exclusive and legitimate property of such and such
individuals  who were not the creators of this value  

if i am not mistaken  there is no one to whom this proposition  at first
sight and in its entirety  does not seem utterly irrefutable  reader 
distrust the syllogism 

first  i observe that the words legitimately possesses signify to the
author s mind is  legitimate proprietor   otherwise the argument  being
intended to prove the legitimacy of property  would have no meaning  i
might here raise the question of the difference between property and
possession  and call upon m  considerant  before going further  to
define the one and the other  but i pass on 

this first proposition is doubly false  1  in that it asserts the act
of creation to be the only basis of property  2  in that it regards this
act as sufficient in all cases to authorize the right of property 

and  in the first place  if man may be proprietor of the game which he
does not create  but which he kills  of the fruits which he does not
create  but which he gathers  of the vegetables which he does not
create  but which he plants  of the animals which he does not create 
but which he rears   it is conceivable that men may in like manner
become proprietors of the land which they do not create  but which they
clear and fertilize  the act of creation  then  is not necessary to the
acquisition of the right of property  i say further  that this act alone
is not always sufficient  and i prove it by the second premise of m 
considerant   


minor premise    suppose that on an isolated island  on the soil of a
nation  or over the whole face of the earth  the extent of the scene of
action does not affect our judgment of the facts   a generation of
human beings devotes itself for the first time to industry  agriculture 
manufactures  &c  this generation  by its labor  intelligence  and
activity  creates products  develops values which did not exist on the
uncultivated land  is it not perfectly clear that the property of this
industrious generation will stand on a basis of right  if the value
or wealth produced by the activity of all be distributed among the
producers  according to each one s assistance in the creation of the
general wealth  that is unquestionable  


that is quite questionable  for this value or wealth  produced by the
activity of all  is by the very fact of its creation collective wealth 
the use of which  like that of the land  may be divided  but which as
property remains undivided  and why this undivided ownership  because
the society which creates is itself indivisible   a permanent unit 
incapable of reduction to fractions  and it is this unity of society
which makes the land common property  and which  as m  considerant
says  renders its use imprescriptible in the case of every individual 
suppose  indeed  that at a given time the soil should be equally
divided  the very next moment this division  if it allowed the right
of property  would become illegitimate  should there be the slightest
irregularity in the method of transfer  men  members of society 
imprescriptible possessors of the land  might be deprived at one blow of
property  possession  and the means of production  in short  property
in capital is indivisible  and consequently inalienable  not necessarily
when the capital is uncreated  but when it is common or collective 

i confirm this theory against m  considerant  by the third term of his
syllogism   


conclusion    the results of the labor performed by this generation are
divisible into two classes  between which it is important clearly to
distinguish  the first class includes the products of the soil which
belong to this first generation in its usufructuary capacity  augmented 
improved and refined by its labor and industry  these products consist
either of objects of consumption or instruments of labor  it is clear
that these products are the legitimate property of those who have
created them by their activity     second class   not only has this
generation created the products just mentioned  objects of consumption
and instruments of labor   but it has also added to the original value
of the soil by cultivation  by the erection of buildings  by all
the labor producing permanent results  which it has performed  this
additional value evidently constitutes a product  a value created by
the activity of the first generation  and if  by any means whatever 
the ownership of this value be distributed among the members of
society equitably   that is  in proportion to the labor which each
has performed   each will legitimately possess the portion which he
receives  he may then dispose of this legitimate and private property
as he sees fit   exchange it  give it away  or transfer it  and no other
individual  or collection of other individuals   that is  society   can
lay any claim to these values  


thus  by the distribution of collective capital  to the use of which
each associate  either in his own right or in right of his authors 
has an imprescriptible and undivided title  there will be in the
phalanstery  as in the france of 1841  the poor and the rich  some men
who  to live in luxury  have only  as figaro says  to take the
trouble to be born  and others for whom the fortune of life is but an
opportunity for long continued poverty  idlers with large incomes  and
workers whose fortune is always in the future  some privileged by birth
and caste  and others pariahs whose sole civil and political rights are
the right to labor  and the right to land  for we must not be deceived 
in the phalanstery every thing will be as it is to day  an object of
property   machines  inventions  thought  books  the products of art 
of agriculture  and of industry  animals  houses  fences  vineyards 
pastures  forests  fields   every thing  in short  except the
uncultivated land  now  would you like to know what uncultivated land is
worth  according to the advocates of property   a square league hardly
suffices for the support of a savage   says m  charles comte  estimating
the wretched subsistence of this savage at three hundred francs
per year  we find that the square league necessary to his life is 
relatively to him  faithfully represented by a rent of fifteen francs 
in france there are twenty eight thousand square leagues  the total rent
of which  by this estimate  would be four hundred and twenty thousand
francs  which  when divided among nearly thirty four millions of people 
would give each an income of a centime and a quarter  that is the new
right which the great genius of fourier has invented in behalf of the
french people  and with which his first disciple hopes to reform the
world  i denounce m  considerant to the proletariat 

if the theory of m  considerant would at least really guarantee this
property which he cherishes so jealously  i might pardon him the flaws
in his syllogism  certainly the best one he ever made in his life  but 
no  that which m  considerant takes for property is only a privilege
of extra pay  in fourier s system  neither the created capital nor
the increased value of the soil are divided and appropriated in any
effective manner  the instruments of labor  whether created or not 
remain in the hands of the phalanx  the pretended proprietor can touch
only the income  he is permitted neither to realize his share of the
stock  nor to possess it exclusively  nor to administer it  whatever it
be  the cashier throws him his dividend  and then  proprietor  eat the
whole if you can 

the system of fourier would not suit the proprietors  since it takes
away the most delightful feature of property   the free disposition of
one s goods  it would please the communists no better  since it involves
unequal conditions  it is repugnant to the friends of free association
and equality  in consequence of its tendency to wipe out human character
and individuality by suppressing possession  family  and country   the
threefold expression of the human personality 

of all our active publicists  none seem to me more fertile in resources 
richer in imagination  more luxuriant and varied in style  than m 
considerant  nevertheless  i doubt if he will undertake to reestablish
his theory of property  if he has this courage  this is what i would say
to him   before writing your reply  consider well your plan of action 
do not scour the country  have recourse to none of your ordinary
expedients  no complaints of civilization  no sarcasms upon equality 
no glorification of the phalanstery  leave fourier and the departed in
peace  and endeavor only to re adjust the pieces of your syllogism  to
this end  you ought  first  to analyze closely each proposition of your
adversary  second  to show the error  either by a direct refutation  or
by proving the converse  third  to oppose argument to argument  so that 
objection and reply meeting face to face  the stronger may break down
the weaker  and shiver it to atoms  by that method only can you boast of
having conquered  and compel me to regard you as an honest reasoner  and
a good artillery man  

i should have no excuse for tarrying longer with these phalansterian
crotchets  if the obligation which i have imposed upon myself of making
a clean sweep  and the necessity of vindicating my dignity as a writer 
did not prevent me from passing in silence the reproach uttered against
me by a correspondent of  la phalange    we have seen but lately   says
this journalist   71   that m  proudhon  enthusiast as he has been for
the science created by fourier  is  or will be  an enthusiast for any
thing else whatsoever  


if ever sectarians had the right to reproach another for changes in
his beliefs  this right certainly does not belong to the disciples of
fourier  who are always so eager to administer the phalansterian baptism
to the deserters of all parties  but why regard it as a crime  if they
are sincere  of what consequence is the constancy or inconstancy of
an individual to the truth which is always the same  it is better
to enlighten men s minds than to teach them to be obstinate in their
prejudices  do we not know that man is frail and fickle  that his heart
is full of delusions  and that his lips are a distillery of falsehood 
 omnis homo meudax   whether we will or no  we all serve for a time as
instruments of this truth  whose kingdom comes every day 

god alone is immutable  because he is eternal 

that is the reply which  as a general rule  an honest man is entitled
always to make  and which i ought perhaps to be content to offer as an
excuse  for i am no better than my fathers  but  in a century of doubt
and apostasy like ours  when it is of importance to set the small and
the weak an example of strength and honesty of utterance  i must not
suffer my character as a public assailant of property to be dishonored 
i must render an account of my old opinions 

examining myself  therefore  upon this charge of fourierism  and
endeavoring to refresh my memory  i find that  having been connected
with the fourierists in my studies and my friendships  it is possible
that  without knowing it  i have been one of fourier s partisans  jerome
lalande placed napoleon and jesus christ in his catalogue of atheists 
the fourierists resemble this astronomer  if a man happens to find fault
with the existing civilization  and to admit the truth of a few of their
criticisms  they straightway enlist him  willy nilly  in their school 
nevertheless  i do not deny that i have been a fourierist  for 
since they say it  of course it may be so  but  sir  that of which my
ex associates are ignorant  and which doubtless will astonish you  is
that i have been many other things   in religion  by turns a protestant 
a papist  an arian and semi arian  a manichean  a gnostic  an
adamite even and a pre adamite  a sceptic  a pelagian  a socinian  an
anti trinitarian  and a neo christian   72  in philosophy and politics 
an idealist  a pantheist  a platonist  a cartesian  an eclectic
 that is  a sort of  juste milieu    a monarchist  an aristocrat 
a constitutionalist  a follower of babeuf  and a communist  i have
wandered through a whole encyclopaedia of systems  do you think
it surprising  sir  that  among them all  i was for a short time a
fourierist 


for my part  i am not at all surprised  although at present i have
no recollection of it  one thing is sure   that my superstition and
credulity reached their height at the very period of my life which my
critics reproachfully assign as the date of my fourieristic beliefs 
now i hold quite other views  my mind no longer admits that which is
demonstrated by syllogisms  analogies  or metaphors  which are the
methods of the phalanstery  but demands a process of generalization and
induction which excludes error  of my past opinionss i retain absolutely
none  i have acquired some knowledge  i no longer believe  i either
know  or am ignorant  in a word  in seeking for the reason of things  i
saw that i was a rationalist 

undoubtedly  it would have been simpler to begin where i have ended 
but then  if such is the law of the human mind  if all society  for six
thousand years  has done nothing but fall into error  if all mankind are
still buried in the darkness of faith  deceived by their prejudices and
passions  guided only by the instinct of their leaders  if my accusers 
themselves  are not free from sectarianism  for they call themselves
fourierists    am i alone inexcusable for having  in my inner self  at
the secret tribunal of my conscience  begun anew the journey of our poor
humanity 

i would by no means  then  deny my errors  but  sir  that which
distinguishes me from those who rush into print is the fact that  though
my thoughts have varied much  my writings do not vary  to day  even  and
on a multitude of questions  i am beset by a thousand extravagant and
contradictory opinions  but my opinions i do not print  for the public
has nothing to do with them  before addressing my fellow men  i wait
until light breaks in upon the chaos of my ideas  in order that what i
may say may be  not the whole truth  no man can know that   but nothing
but the truth 

this singular disposition of my mind to first identify itself with a
system in order to better understand it  and then to reflect upon it in
order to test its legitimacy  is the very thing which disgusted me with
fourier  and ruined in my esteem the societary school  to be a faithful
fourierist  in fact  one must abandon his reason and accept every
thing from a master   doctrine  interpretation  and application  m 
considerant  whose excessive intolerance anathematizes all who do not
abide by his sovereign decisions  has no other conception of fourierism 
has he not been appointed fourier s vicar on earth and pope of a church
which  unfortunately for its apostles  will never be of this world 
passive belief is the theological virtue of all sectarians  especially
of the fourierists 

now  this is what happened to me  while trying to demonstrate by
argument the religion of which i had become a follower in studying
fourier  i suddenly perceived that by reasoning i was becoming
incredulous  that on each article of the creed my reason and my faith
were at variance  and that my six weeks  labor was wholly lost  i saw
that the fourierists  in spite of their inexhaustible gabble  and their
extravagant pretension to decide in all things  were neither savants 
nor logicians  nor even believers  that they were scientific quacks  who
were led more by their self love than their conscience to labor for the
triumph of their sect  and to whom all means were good that would reach
that end  i then understood why to the epicureans they promised women 
wine  music  and a sea of luxury  to the rigorists  maintenance of
marriage  purity of morals  and temperance  to laborers  high wages 
to proprietors  large incomes  to philosophers  solutions the secret
of which fourier alone possessed  to priests  a costly religion and
magnificent festivals  to savants  knowledge of an unimaginable nature 
to each  indeed  that which he most desired  in the beginning 
this seemed to me droll  in the end  i regarded it as the height of
impudence  no  sir  no one yet knows of the foolishness and infamy which
the phalansterian system contains  that is a subject which i mean to
treat as soon as i have balanced my accounts with property   73 


it is rumored that the fourierists think of leaving france and going to
the new world to found a phalanstery  when a house threatens to fall 
the rats scamper away  that is because they are rats  men do better 
they rebuild it  not long since  the st  simonians  despairing of their
country which paid no heed to them  proudly shook the dust from their
feet  and started for the orient to fight the battle of free woman 
pride  wilfulness  mad selfishness  true charity  like true faith 
does not worry  never despairs  it seeks neither its own glory  nor
its interest  nor empire  it does every thing for all  speaks with
indulgence to the reason and the will  and desires to conquer only by
persuasion and sacrifice  remain in france  fourierists  if the progress
of humanity is the only thing which you have at heart  there is more to
do here than in the new world  otherwise  go  you are nothing but liars
and hypocrites 

the foregoing statement by no means embraces all the political elements 
all the opinions and tendencies  which threaten the future of property 
but it ought to satisfy any one who knows how to classify facts  and to
deduce their law or the idea which governs them  existing society seems
abandoned to the demon of falsehood and discord  and it is this sad
sight which grieves so deeply many distinguished minds who lived too
long in a former age to be able to understand ours  now  while the
short sighted spectator begins to despair of humanity  and  distracted
and cursing that of which he is ignorant  plunges into scepticism and
fatalism  the true observer  certain of the spirit which governs
the world  seeks to comprehend and fathom providence  the memoir on
 property   published last year by the pensioner of the academy of
besancon  is simply a study of this nature 

the time has come for me to relate the history of this unlucky treatise 
which has already caused me so much chagrin  and made me so unpopular 
but which was on my part so involuntary and unpremeditated  that i would
dare to affirm that there is not an economist  not a philosopher  not a
jurist  who is not a hundred times guiltier than i  there is something
so singular in the way in which i was led to attack property  that if 
on hearing my sad story  you persist  sir  in your blame  i hope at
least you will be forced to pity me 

i never have pretended to be a great politician  far from that  i always
have felt for controversies of a political nature the greatest aversion 
and if  in my  essay on property   i have sometimes ridiculed our
politicians  believe  sir  that i was governed much less by my pride
in the little that i know  than by my vivid consciousness of their
ignorance and excessive vanity  relying more on providence than on
men  not suspecting at first that politics  like every other science 
contained an absolute truth  agreeing equally well with bossuet and
jean jacques   i accepted with resignation my share of human misery 
and contented myself with praying to god for good deputies  upright
ministers  and an honest king  by taste as well as by discretion and
lack of confidence in my powers  i was slowly pursuing some commonplace
studies in philology  mingled with a little metaphysics  when i suddenly
fell upon the greatest problem that ever has occupied philosophical
minds  i mean the criterion of certainty 

those of my readers who are unacquainted with the philosophical
terminology will be glad to be told in a few words what this criterion
is  which plays so great a part in my work 

the criterion of certainty  according to the philosophers  will be 
when discovered  an infallible method of establishing the truth of an
opinion  a judgment  a theory  or a system  in nearly the same way as
gold is recognized by the touchstone  as iron approaches the magnet 
or  better still  as we verify a mathematical operation by applying
the proof  time has hitherto served as a sort of criterion for society 
thus  the primitive men  having observed that they were not all equal
in strength  beauty  and labor  judged  and rightly  that certain ones
among them were called by nature to the performance of simple and common
functions  but they concluded  and this is where their error lay  that
these same individuals of duller intellect  more restricted genius  and
weaker personality  were predestined to serve the others  that is  to
labor while the latter rested  and to have no other will than theirs 
and from this idea of a natural subordination among men sprang
domesticity  which  voluntarily accepted at first  was imperceptibly
converted into horrible slavery  time  making this error more palpable 
has brought about justice  nations have learned at their own cost that
the subjection of man to man is a false idea  an erroneous theory 
pernicious alike to master and to slave  and yet such a social system
has stood several thousand years  and has been defended by celebrated
philosophers  even to day  under somewhat mitigated forms  sophists of
every description uphold and extol it  but experience is bringing it to
an end 

time  then  is the criterion of societies  thus looked at  history is
the demonstration of the errors of humanity by the argument  reductio ad
absurdum  

now  the criterion sought for by metaphysicians would have the advantage
of discriminating at once between the true and the false in every
opinion  so that in politics  religion  and morals  for example  the
true and the useful being immediately recognized  we should no longer
need to await the sorrowful experience of time  evidently such a secret
would be death to the sophists   that cursed brood  who  under different
names  excite the curiosity of nations  and  owing to the difficulty
of separating the truth from the error in their artistically woven
theories  lead them into fatal ventures  disturb their peace  and fill
them with such extraordinary prejudice 

up to this day  the criterion of certainty remains a mystery  this is
owing to the multitude of criteria that have been successively proposed 
some have taken for an absolute and definite criterion the testimony
of the senses  others intuition  these evidence  those argument  m 
lamennais affirms that there is no other criterion than universal
reason  before him  m  de bonald thought he had discovered it in
language  quite recently  m  buchez has proposed morality  and  to
harmonize them all  the eclectics have said that it was absurd to seek
for an absolute criterion  since there were as many criteria as special
orders of knowledge 

of all these hypotheses it may be observed  that the testimony of the
senses is not a criterion  because the senses  relating us only to
phenomena  furnish us with no ideas  that intuition needs external
confirmation or objective certainty  that evidence requires proof  and
argument verification  that universal reason has been wrong many a time 
that language serves equally well to express the true or the false  that
morality  like all the rest  needs demonstration and rule  and finally 
that the eclectic idea is the least reasonable of all  since it is of no
use to say that there are several criteria if we cannot point out one 
i very much fear that it will be with the criterion as with the
philosopher s stone  that it will finally be abandoned  not only as
insolvable  but as chimerical  consequently  i entertain no hopes of
having found it  nevertheless  i am not sure that some one more skilful
will not discover it 

be it as it may with regard to a criterion or criteria  there are
methods of demonstration which  when applied to certain subjects 
may lead to the discovery of unknown truths  bring to light relations
hitherto unsuspected  and lift a paradox to the highest degree of
certainty  in such a case  it is not by its novelty  nor even by its
content  that a system should be judged  but by its method  the critic 
then  should follow the example of the supreme court  which  in the
cases which come before it  never examines the facts  but only the form
of procedure  now  what is the form of procedure  a method 

i then looked to see what philosophy  in the absence of a criterion  had
accomplished by the aid of special methods  and i must say that i
could not discover  in spite of the loudly proclaimed pretensions
of some  that it had produced any thing of real value  and  at last 
wearied with the philosophical twaddle  i resolved to make a new search
for the criterion  i confess it  to my shame  this folly lasted for two
years  and i am not yet entirely rid of it  it was like seeking a needle
in a haystack  i might have learned chinese or arabic in the time that i
have lost in considering and reconsidering syllogisms  in rising to
the summit of an induction as to the top of a ladder  in inserting
a proposition between the horns of a dilemma  in decomposing 
distinguishing  separating  denying  affirming  admitting  as if i could
pass abstractions through a sieve 

i selected justice as the subject matter of my experiments 
finally  after a thousand decompositions  recompositions  and double
compositions  i found at the bottom of my analytical crucible  not the
criterion of certainty  but a metaphysico economico political treatise 
whose conclusions were such that i did not care to present them in a
more artistic or  if you will  more intelligible form  the effect which
this work produced upon all classes of minds gave me an idea of the
spirit of our age  and did not cause me to regret the prudent and
scientific obscurity of my style  how happens it that to day i am
obliged to defend my intentions  when my conduct bears the evident
impress of such lofty morality 

you have read my work  sir  and you know the gist of my tedious and
scholastic lucubrations  considering the revolutions of humanity 
the vicissitudes of empires  the transformations of property  and the
innumerable forms of justice and of right  i asked   are the evils which
afflict us inherent in our condition as men  or do they arise only from
an error  this inequality of fortunes which all admit to be the cause of
society s embarrassments  is it  as some assert  the effect of nature 
or  in the division of the products of labor and the soil  may there not
have been some error in calculation  does each laborer receive all that
is due him  and only that which is due him  in short  in the present
conditions of labor  wages  and exchange  is no one wronged   are the
accounts well kept   is the social balance accurate  

then i commenced a most laborious investigation  it was necessary to
arrange informal notes  to discuss contradictory titles  to reply to
captious allegations  to refute absurd pretensions  and to describe
fictitious debts  dishonest transactions  and fraudulent accounts  in
order to triumph over quibblers  i had to deny the authority of custom 
to examine the arguments of legislators  and to oppose science with
science itself  finally  all these operations completed  i had to give a
judicial decision 

i therefore declared  my hand upon my heart  before god and men  that
the causes of social inequality are three in number  1  gratuitous
appropriation of collective wealth  2  inequality in exchange  3  the
right of profit or increase 

and since this threefold method of extortion is the very essence of the
domain of property  i denied the legitimacy of property  and proclaimed
its identity with robbery 

that is my only offence  i have reasoned upon property  i have searched
for the criterion of justice  i have demonstrated  not the possibility 
but the necessity  of equality of fortunes  i have allowed myself no
attack upon persons  no assault upon the government  of which i  more
than any one else  am a provisional adherent  if i have sometimes
used the word proprietor  i have used it as the abstract name of a
metaphysical being  whose reality breathes in every individual   not
alone in a privileged few 

nevertheless  i acknowledge  for i wish my confession to be
sincere  that the general tone of my book has been bitterly censured 
they complain of an atmosphere of passion and invective unworthy of
an honest man  and quite out of place in the treatment of so grave a
subject 

if this reproach is well founded  which it is impossible for me either
to deny or admit  because in my own cause i cannot be judge    if  i
say  i deserve this charge  i can only humble myself and acknowledge
myself guilty of an involuntary wrong  the only excuse that i could
offer being of such a nature that it ought not to be communicated to the
public  all that i can say is  that i understand better than any one how
the anger which injustice causes may render an author harsh and violent
in his criticisms  when  after twenty years of labor  a man still finds
himself on the brink of starvation  and then suddenly discovers in
an equivocation  an error in calculation  the cause of the evil which
torments him in common with so many millions of his fellows  he can
scarcely restrain a cry of sorrow and dismay 

but  sir  though pride be offended by my rudeness  it is not to pride
that i apologize  but to the proletaires  to the simple minded  whom i
perhaps have scandalized  my angry dialectics may have produced a bad
effect on some peaceable minds  some poor workingman  more affected
by my sarcasm than by the strength of my arguments  may  perhaps  have
concluded that property is the result of a perpetual machiavelianism on
the part of the governors against the governed   a deplorable error of
which my book itself is the best refutation  i devoted two chapters to
showing how property springs from human personality and the comparison
of individuals  then i explained its perpetual limitation  and 
following out the same idea  i predicted its approaching disappearance 
how  then  could the editors of the  revue democratique   after
having borrowed from me nearly the whole substance of their economical
articles  dare to say   the holders of the soil  and other productive
capital  are more or less wilful accomplices in a vast robbery  they
being the exclusive receivers and sharers of the stolen goods  

the proprietors wilfully guilty of the crime of robbery  never did
that homicidal phrase escape my pen  never did my heart conceive the
frightful thought  thank heaven  i know not how to calumniate my kind 
and i have too strong a desire to seek for the reason of things to be
willing to believe in criminal conspiracies  the millionnaire is no more
tainted by property than the journeyman who works for thirty sous per
day  on both sides the error is equal  as well as the intention  the
effect is also the same  though positive in the former  and negative
in the latter  i accused property  i did not denounce the proprietors 
which would have been absurd  and i am sorry that there are among us
wills so perverse and minds so shattered that they care for only so much
of the truth as will aid them in their evil designs  such is the
only regret which i feel on account of my indignation  which  though
expressed perhaps too bitterly  was at least honest  and legitimate in
its source 

however  what did i do in this essay which i voluntarily submitted
to the academy of moral sciences  seeking a fixed axiom amid social
uncertainties  i traced back to one fundamental question all the
secondary questions over which  at present  so keen and diversified
a conflict is raging this question was the right of property  then 
comparing all existing theories with each other  and extracting from
them that which is common to them all  i endeavored to discover that
element in the idea of property which is necessary  immutable  and
absolute  and asserted  after authentic verification  that this idea
is reducible to that of individual and transmissible possession 
susceptible of exchange  but not of alienation  founded on labor  and
not on fictitious occupancy  or idle caprice  i said  further  that this
idea was the result of our revolutionary movements   the culminating
point towards which all opinions  gradually divesting themselves of
their contradictory elements  converge  and i tried to demonstrate
this by the spirit of the laws  by political economy  by psychology and
history 

a father of the church  finishing a learned exposition of the catholic
doctrine  cried  in the enthusiasm of his faith    domine  si error est 
a te decepti sumus   if my religion is false  god is to blame    i  as
well as this theologian  can say   if equality is a fable  god  through
whom we act and think and are  god  who governs society by eternal laws 
who rewards just nations  and punishes proprietors   god alone is the
author of evil  god has lied  the fault lies not with me  

but  if i am mistaken in my inferences  i should be shown my error  and
led out of it  it is surely worth the trouble  and i think i deserve
this honor  there is no ground for proscription 

for  in the words of that member of the convention who did not like
the guillotine   to kill is not to reply   until then  i persist in
regarding my work as useful  social  full of instruction for public
officials   worthy  in short  of reward and encouragement 

for there is one truth of which i am profoundly convinced   nations
live by absolute ideas  not by approximate and partial conceptions 
therefore  men are needed who define principles  or at least test them
in the fire of controversy  such is the law   the idea first  the pure
idea  the understanding of the laws of god  the theory  practice follows
with slow steps  cautious  attentive to the succession of events  sure
to seize  towards this eternal meridian  the indications of supreme
reason 

the co operation of theory and practice produces in humanity the
realization of order   the absolute truth   74 


all of us  as long as we live  are called  each in proportion to his
strength  to this sublime work  the only duty which it imposes upon
us is to refrain from appropriating the truth to ourselves  either by
concealing it  or by accommodating it to the temper of the century 
or by using it for our own interests  this principle of conscience  so
grand and so simple  has always been present in my thought 

consider  in fact  sir  that which i might have done  but did not wish
to do  i reason on the most honorable hypothesis  what hindered me from
concealing  for some years to come  the abstract theory of the equality
of fortunes  and  at the same time  from criticising constitutions and
codes  from showing the absolute and the contingent  the immutable and
the ephemeral  the eternal and the transitory  in laws present and past 
from constructing a new system of legislation  and establishing on
a solid foundation this social edifice  ever destroyed and as often
rebuilt  might i not  taking up the definitions of casuists  have
clearly shown the cause of their contradictions and uncertainties  and
supplied  at the same time  the inadequacies of their conclusions  might
i not have confirmed this labor by a vast historical exposition  in
which the principle of exclusion  and of the accumulation of property 
the appropriation of collective wealth  and the radical vice in
exchanges  would have figured as the constant causes of tyranny  war 
and revolution 

 it should have been done   you say  do not doubt  sir  that such a task
would have required more patience than genius  with the principles of
social economy which i have analyzed  i would have had only to break
the ground  and follow the furrow  the critic of laws finds nothing more
difficult than to determine justice  the labor alone would have been
longer  oh  if i had pursued this glittering prospect  and  like the
man of the burning bush  with inspired countenance and deep and solemn
voice  had presented myself some day with new tables  there would have
been found fools to admire  boobies to applaud  and cowards to offer me
the dictatorship  for  in the way of popular infatuations  nothing is
impossible 

but  sir  after this monument of insolence and pride  what should i have
deserved in your opinion  at the tribunal of god  and in the judgment of
free men  death  sir  and eternal reprobation 

i therefore spoke the truth as soon as i saw it  waiting only long
enough to give it proper expression  i pointed out error in order
that each might reform himself  and render his labors more useful  i
announced the existence of a new political element  in order that
my associates in reform  developing it in concert  might arrive more
promptly at that unity of principles which alone can assure to society
a better day  i expected to receive  if not for my book  at least for
my commendable conduct  a small republican ovation  and  behold 
journalists denounce me  academicians curse me  political adventurers
 great god   think to make themselves tolerable by protesting that they
are not like me  i give the formula by which the whole social edifice
may be scientifically reconstructed  and the strongest minds reproach
me for being able only to destroy  the rest despise me  because i am
unknown  when the  essay on property  fell into the reformatory camp 
some asked   who has spoken  is it arago  is it lamennais  michel de
bourges or garnier pages  

and when they heard the name of a new man   we do not know him  
they would reply  thus  the monopoly of thought  property in reason 
oppresses the proletariat as well as the  bourgeoisie   the worship of
the infamous prevails even on the steps of the tabernacle 

but what am i saying  may evil befall me  if i blame the poor creatures 
oh  let us not despise those generous souls  who in the excitement of
their patriotism are always prompt to identify the voice of their
chiefs with the truth  let us encourage rather their simple credulity 
enlighten complacently and tenderly their precious sincerity  and
reserve our shafts for those vain glorious spirits who are always
admiring their genius  and  in different tongues  caressing the people
in order to govern them 

these considerations alone oblige me to reply to the strange and
superficial conclusions of the  journal du peuple   issue of oct  11 
1840   on the question of property  i leave  therefore  the journalist
to address myself only to his readers  i hope that the self love of the
writer will not be offended  if  in the presence of the masses  i ignore
an individual 

you say  proletaires of the  peuple    for the very reason that men and
things exist  there always will be men who will possess things  nothing 
therefore  can destroy property  

in speaking thus  you unconsciously argue exactly after the manner of
m  cousin  who always reasons from  possession  to property  this
coincidence  however  does not surprise me  m  cousin is a philosopher
of much mind  and you  proletaires  have still more  certainly it is
honorable  even for a philosopher  to be your companion in error 

originally  the word property was synonymous with proper or individual
possession  it designated each individual s special right to the use of
a thing  but when this right of use  inert  if i may say so  as it
was with regard to the other usufructuaries  became active and
paramount   that is  when the usufructuary converted his right to
personally use the thing into the right to use it by his neighbor s
labor   then property changed its nature  and its idea became complex 
the legists knew this very well  but instead of opposing  as they ought 
this accumulation of profits  they accepted and sanctioned the whole 
and as the right of farm rent necessarily implies the right of use   in
other words  as the right to cultivate land by the labor of a slave
supposes one s power to cultivate it himself  according to the principle
that the greater includes the less   the name property was reserved
to designate this double right  and that of possession was adopted to
designate the right of use 

whence property came to be called the perfect right  the right of
domain  the eminent right  the heroic or  quiritaire  right   in latin 
 jus perfectum  jus optimum  jus quiritarium  jus dominii    while
possession became assimilated to farm rent 

now  that individual possession exists of right  or  better 
from natural necessity  all philosophers admit  and can easily e
demonstrated  but when  in imitation of m  cousin  we assume it to be
the basis of the domain of property  we fall into the sophism called
 sophisma amphiboliae vel ambiguitatis   which consists in changing the
meaning by a verbal equivocation 

people often think themselves very profound  because  by the aid of
expressions of extreme generality  they appear to rise to the height
of absolute ideas  and thus deceive inexperienced minds  and  what
is worse  this is commonly called examining abstractions  but the
abstraction formed by the comparison of identical facts is one thing 
while that which is deduced from different acceptations of the same term
is quite another  the first gives the universal idea  the axiom  the
law  the second indicates the order of generation of ideas  all
our errors arise from the constant confusion of these two kinds of
abstractions  in this particular  languages and philosophies are alike
deficient  the less common an idiom is  and the more obscure its
terms  the more prolific is it as a source of error  a philosopher is
sophistical in proportion to his ignorance of any method of neutralizing
this imperfection in language  if the art of correcting the errors of
speech by scientific methods is ever discovered  then philosophy will
have found its criterion of certainty 

now  then  the difference between property and possession being well
established  and it being settled that the former  for the reasons
which i have just given  must necessarily disappear  is it best  for the
slight advantage of restoring an etymology  to retain the word property 
my opinion is that it would be very unwise to do so  and i will tell
why  i quote from the  journal du peuple    


 to the legislative power belongs the right to regulate property  to
prescribe the conditions of acquiring  possessing  and transmitting
it    it cannot be denied that inheritance  assessment  commerce 
industry  labor  and wages require the most important modifications  


you wish  proletaires  to regulate property  that is  you wish to
destroy it and reduce it to the right of possession  for to regulate
property without the consent of the proprietors is to deny the right
of domain  to associate employees with proprietors is to destroy
the eminent right  to suppress or even reduce farm rent  house rent 
revenue  and increase generally  is to annihilate perfect property  why 
then  while laboring with such laudable enthusiasm for the establishment
of equality  should you retain an expression whose equivocal meaning
will always be an obstacle in the way of your success 

there you have the first reason  a wholly philosophical one  for
rejecting not only the thing  but the name  property  here now is the
political  the highest reason 

every social revolution  m  cousin will tell you  is effected only by
the realization of an idea  either political  moral  or religious  when
alexander conquered asia  his idea was to avenge greek liberty against
the insults of oriental despotism  when marius and caesar overthrew
the roman patricians  their idea was to give bread to the people 
when christianity revolutionized the world  its idea was to emancipate
mankind  and to substitute the worship of one god for the deities of
epicurus and homer  when france rose in  89  her idea was liberty and
equality before the law  there has been no true revolution  says m 
cousin  with out its idea  so that where an idea does not exist  or even
fails of a formal expression  revolution is impossible  there are mobs 
conspirators  rioters  regicides  there are no revolutionists  society 
devoid of ideas  twists and tosses about  and dies in the midst of its
fruitless labor 

nevertheless  you all feel that a revolution is to come  and that you
alone can accomplish it  what  then  is the idea which governs you 
proletaires of the nineteenth century   for really i cannot call you
revolutionists  what do you think   what do you believe   what do you
want  be guarded in your reply  i have read faithfully your favorite
journals  your most esteemed authors  i find everywhere only vain and
puerile  entites   nowhere do i discover an idea 

i will explain the meaning of this word  entite    new  without doubt 
to most of you 

by  entite  is generally understood a substance which the imagination
grasps  but which is incognizable by the senses and the reason  thus the
soporific power of opium  of which sganarelle speaks  and the peccant
humors of ancient medicine  are  entites   the  entite  is the
support of those who do not wish to confess their ignorance  it
is incomprehensible  or  as st  paul says  the  argumentum non
apparentium   in philosophy  the  entite  is often only a repetition of
words which add nothing to the thought 

for example  when m  pierre leroux  who says so many excellent things 
but who is too fond  in my opinion  of his platonic formulas  assures us
that the evils of humanity are due to our ignorance of life  m  pierre
leroux utters an  entite   for it is evident that if we are evil it is
because we do not know how to live  but the knowledge of this fact is of
no value to us 

when m  edgar quinet declares that france suffers and declines because
there is an antagonism of men and of interests  he declares an  entite  
for the problem is to discover the cause of this antagonism 

when m  lamennais  in thunder tones  preaches self sacrifice and love 
he proclaims two  entites   for we need to know on what conditions
self sacrifice and love can spring up and exist 

so also  proletaires  when you talk of liberty  progress  and the
sovereignty of the people  you make of these naturally intelligible
things so many  entites  in space  for  on the one hand  we need a new
definition of liberty  since that of  89 no longer suffices  and  on the
other  we must know in what direction society should proceed in order to
be in progress  as for the sovereignty of the people  that is a
grosser  entite  than the sovereignty of reason  it is the  entite 
of  entites   in fact  since sovereignty can no more be conceived
of outside of the people than outside of reason  it remains to be
ascertained who  among the people  shall exercise the sovereignty  and 
among so many minds  which shall be the sovereigns  to say that the
people should elect their representatives is to say that the people
should recognize their sovereigns  which does not remove the difficulty
at all 

but suppose that  equal by birth  equal before the law  equal in
personality  equal in social functions  you wish also to be equal in
conditions 

suppose that  perceiving all the mutual relations of men  whether
they produce or exchange or consume  to be relations of commutative
justice   in a word  social relations  suppose  i say  that  perceiving
this  you wish to give this natural society a legal existence  and to
establish the fact by law   

i say that then you need a clear  positive  and exact expression of your
whole idea   that is  an expression which states at once the principle 
the means  and the end  and i add that that expression is association 

and since the association of the human race dates  at least rightfully 
from the beginning of the world  and has gradually established and
perfected itself by successively divesting itself of its negative
elements  slavery  nobility  despotism  aristocracy  and feudalism   i
say that  to eliminate the last negation of society  to formulate the
last revolutionary idea  you must change your old rallying cries  no
more absolutism  no more nobility  no more slaves  into that of no more
property    

but i know what astonishes you  poor souls  blasted by the wind of
poverty  and crushed by your patrons  pride  it is equality  whose
consequences frighten you  how  you have said in your journal   how can
we  dream of a level which  being unnatural  is therefore unjust  how
shall we pay the day s labor of a cormenin or a lamennais  

plebeians  listen  when  after the battle of salamis  the athenians
assembled to award the prizes for courage  after the ballots had been
collected  it was found that each combatant had one vote for the first
prize  and themistocles all the votes for the second  the people of
minerva were crowned by their own hands  truly heroic souls  all were
worthy of the olive branch  since all had ventured to claim it for
themselves  antiquity praised this sublime spirit  learn  proletaires 
to esteem yourselves  and to respect your dignity  you wish to be
free  and you know not how to be citizens  now  whoever says  citizens 
necessarily says equals 

if i should call myself lamennais or cormenin  and some journal 
speaking of me  should burst forth with these hyperboles  incomparable
genius  superior mind  consummate virtue  noble character  i should not
like it  and should complain   first  because such eulogies are never
deserved  and  second  because they furnish a bad example  but i wish 
in order to reconcile you to equality  to measure for you the
greatest literary personage of our century  do not accuse me of envy 
proletaires  if i  a defender of equality  estimate at their proper
value talents which are universally admired  and which i  better than
any one  know how to recognize  a dwarf can always measure a giant  all
that he needs is a yardstick 

you have seen the pretentious announcements of  l esquisse d une
philosophie   and you have admired the work on trust  for either you
have not read it  or  if you have  you are incapable of judging it 
acquaint yourselves  then  with this speculation more brilliant than
sound  and  while admiring the enthusiasm of the author  cease to pity
those useful labors which only habit and the great number of the
persons engaged in them render contemptible  i shall be brief  for 
notwithstanding the importance of the subject and the genius of the
author  what i have to say is of but little moment 

m  lamennais starts with the existence of god  how does he demonstrate
it  by cicero s argument   that is  by the consent of the human race 
there is nothing new in that  we have still to find out whether the
belief of the human race is legitimate  or  as kant says  whether
our subjective certainty of the existence of god corresponds with the
objective truth  this  however  does not trouble m  lamennais  he says
that  if the human race believes  it is because it has a reason for
believing 

then  having pronounced the name of god  m  lamennais sings a hymn  and
that is his demonstration 

this first hypothesis admitted  m  lamennais follows it with a second 
namely  that there are three persons in god  but  while christianity
teaches the dogma of the trinity only on the authority of revelation  m 
lamennais pretends to arrive at it by the sole force of argument  and he
does not perceive that his pretended demonstration is  from beginning to
end  anthropomorphism   that is  an ascription of the faculties of the
human mind and the powers of nature to the divine substance  new songs 
new hymns 

god and the trinity thus demonstrated  the philosopher passes to the
creation   a third hypothesis  in which m  lamennais  always eloquent 
varied  and sublime  demonstrates that god made the world neither of
nothing  nor of something  nor of himself  that he was free in creating 
but that nevertheless he could not but create  that there is in matter
a matter which is not matter  that the archetypal ideas of the world are
separated from each other  in the divine mind  by a division which is
obscure and unintelligible  and yet substantial and real  which involves
intelligibility  &c  we meet with like contradictions concerning the
origin of evil  to explain this problem   one of the profoundest in
philosophy   m  lamennais at one time denies evil  at another makes god
the author of evil  and at still another seeks outside of god a
first cause which is not god   an amalgam of  entites  more or less
incoherent  borrowed from plato  proclus  spinoza  i might say even from
all philosophers 

having thus established his trinity of hypotheses  m  lamennais
deduces therefrom  by a badly connected chain of analogies  his whole
philosophy  and it is here especially that we notice the syncretism
which is peculiar to him  the theory of m  lamennais embraces all
systems  and supports all opinions  are you a materialist  suppress 
as useless  entites   the three persons in god  then  starting directly
from heat  light  and electro magnetism   which  according to the
author  are the three original fluids  the three primary external
manifestations of will  intelligence  and love   you have a
materialistic and atheistic cosmogony  on the contrary  are you wedded
to spiritualism  with the theory of the immateriality of the body  you
are able to see everywhere nothing but spirits  finally  if you incline
to pantheism  you will be satisfied by m  lamennais  who formally
teaches that the world is not an emanation from divinity   which is pure
pantheism   but a flow of divinity 

i do not pretend  however  to deny that  l esquisse  contains some
excellent things  but  by the author s declaration  these things are not
original with him  it is the system which is his  that is undoubtedly
the reason why m  lamennais speaks so contemptuously of his predecessors
in philosophy  and disdains to quote his originals  he thinks that 
since  l esquisse  contains all true philosophy  the world will lose
nothing when the names and works of the old philosophers perish  m 
lamennais  who renders glory to god in beautiful songs  does not know
how as well to render justice to his fellows  his fatal fault is this
appropriation of knowledge  which the theologians call the philosophical
sin  or the sin against the holy ghost  a sin which will not damn you 
proletaires  nor me either 

in short   l esquisse   judged as a system  and divested of all which
its author borrows from previous systems  is a commonplace work  whose
method consists in constantly explaining the known by the unknown  and
in giving entites for abstractions  and tautologies for proofs  its
whole theodicy is a work not of genius but of imagination  a patching up
of neo platonic ideas  the psychological portion amounts to nothing 
m  lamennais openly ridiculing labors of this character  without which 
however  metaphysics is impossible  the book  which treats of logic
and its methods  is weak  vague  and shallow  finally  we find in the
physical and physiological speculations which m  lamennais deduces
from his trinitarian cosmogony grave errors  the preconceived design of
accommodating facts to theory  and the substitution in almost every case
of hypothesis for reality  the third volume on industry and art is the
most interesting to read  and the best  it is true that m  lamennais
can boast of nothing but his style  as a philosopher  he has added not a
single idea to those which existed before him 

why  then  this excessive mediocrity of m  lamennais considered as
a thinker  a mediocrity which disclosed itself at the time of the
publication of the  essai sur l indifference    it is because  remember
this well  proletaires   nature makes no man truly complete  and because
the development of certain faculties almost always excludes an equal
development of the opposite faculties  it is because m  lamennais
is preeminently a poet  a man of feeling and sentiment  look at his
style   exuberant  sonorous  picturesque  vehement  full of exaggeration
and invective   and hold it for certain that no man possessed of such
a style was ever a true metaphysician  this wealth of expression and
illustration  which everybody admires  becomes in m lamennais the
incurable cause of his philosophical impotence  his flow of language 
and his sensitive nature misleading his imagination  he thinks that
he is reasoning when he is only repeating himself  and readily takes a
description for a logical deduction  hence his horror of positive ideas 
his feeble powers of analysis  his pronounced taste for indefinite
analogies  verbal abstractions  hypothetical generalities  in short  all
sorts of entites 

further  the entire life of m  lamennais is conclusive proof of
his anti philosophical genius  devout even to mysticism  an ardent
ultramontane  an intolerant theocrat  he at first feels the double
influence of the religious reaction and the literary theories which
marked the beginning of this century  and falls back to the middle ages
and gregory vii   then  suddenly becoming a progressive christian and a
democrat  he gradually leans towards rationalism  and finally falls into
deism  at present  everybody waits at the trap door  as for me  though i
would not swear to it  i am inclined to think that m  lamennais  already
taken with scepticism  will die in a state of indifference  he owes
to individual reason and methodical doubt this expiation of his early
essays 

it has been pretended that m  lamennais  preaching now a theocracy  now
universal democracy  has been always consistent  that  under different
names  he has sought invariably one and the same thing   unity  pitiful
excuse for an author surprised in the very act of contradiction  what
would be thought of a man who  by turns a servant of despotism under
louis xvi  a demagogue with robespierre  a courtier of the emperor 
a bigot during fifteen years of the restoration  a conservative
since 1830  should dare to say that he ever had wished for but one
thing   public order  would he be regarded as any the less a renegade
from all parties  public order  unity  the world s welfare  social
harmony  the union of the nations   concerning each of these things
there is no possible difference of opinion  everybody wishes them 
the character of the publicist depends only upon the means by which
he proposes to arrive at them  but why look to m  lamennais for a
steadfastness of opinion  which he himself repudiates  has he not said 
 the mind has no law  that which i believe to day  i did not believe
yesterday  i do not know that i shall believe it to morrow  

no  there is no real superiority among men  since all talents and
capacities are combined never in one individual  this man has the power
of thought  that one imagination and style  still another industrial and
commercial capacity  by our very nature and education  we possess only
special aptitudes which are limited and confined  and which become
consequently more necessary as they gain in depth and strength 
capacities are to each other as functions and persons  who would dare
to classify them in ranks  the finest genius is  by the laws of his
existence and development  the most dependent upon the society which
creates him  who would dare to make a god of the glorious child 

 it is not strength which makes the man   said a hercules of the
market place to the admiring crowd   it is character   that man  who
had only his muscles  held force in contempt  the lesson is a good one 
proletaires  we should profit by it  it is not talent  which is also a
force   it is not knowledge  it is not beauty which makes the man  it is
heart  courage  will  virtue  now  if we are equal in that which makes
us men  how can the accidental distribution of secondary faculties
detract from our manhood 

remember that privilege is naturally and inevitably the lot of the weak 
and do not be misled by the fame which accompanies certain talents
whose greatest merit consists in their rarity  and a long and toilsome
apprenticeship  it is easier for m  lamennais to recite a philippic  or
sing a humanitarian ode after the platonic fashion  than to discover a
single useful truth  it is easier for an economist to apply the laws of
production and distribution than to write ten lines in the style of m 
lamennais  it is easier for both to speak than to act  you  then  who
put your hands to the work  who alone truly create  why do you wish me
to admit your inferiority  but  what am i saying 

yes  you are inferior  for you lack virtue and will  ready for labor and
for battle  you have  when liberty and equality are in question  neither
courage nor character 

in the preface to his pamphlet on  le pays et le gouvernement   as well
as in his defence before the jury  m  lamennais frankly declared
himself an advocate of property  out of regard for the author and his
misfortune  i shall abstain from characterizing this declaration  and
from examining these two sorrowful performances  m  lamennais seems to
be only the tool of a quasi radical party  which flatters him in order
to use him  without respect for a glorious  but hence forth powerless 
old age  what means this profession of faith  from the first number of
 l avenir  to  l esquisse d une philosophie   m  lamennais always
favors equality  association  and even a sort of vague and indefinite
communism  m  lamennais  in recognizing the right of property  gives the
lie to his past career  and renounces his most generous tendencies  can
it  then  be true that in this man  who has been too roughly treated 
but who is also too easily flattered  strength of talent has already
outlived strength of will 

it is said that m  lamennais has rejected the offers of several of his
friends to try to procure for him a commutation of his sentence  m 
lamennais prefers to serve out his time  may not this affectation of a
false stoicism come from the same source as his recognition of the right
of property  the huron  when taken prisoner  hurls insults and threats
at his conqueror   that is the heroism of the savage  the martyr
prays for his executioners  and is willing to receive from them his
life   that is the heroism of the christian  why has the apostle of love
become an apostle of anger and revenge  has  then  the translator of
 l imitation  forgotten that he who offends charity cannot honor virtue 
galileo  retracting on his knees before the tribunal of the inquisition
his heresy in regard to the movement of the earth  and recovering at
that price his liberty  seems to me a hundred times grander than
m  lamennais  what  if we suffer for truth and justice  must we  in
retaliation  thrust our persecutors outside the pale of human society 
and  when sentenced to an unjust punishment  must we decline exemption
if it is offered to us  because it pleases a few base satellites to call
it a pardon  such is not the wisdom of christianity  but i forgot that
in the presence of m  lamennais this name is no longer pronounced  may
the prophet of  l avenir  be soon restored to liberty and his friends 
but  above all  may he henceforth derive his inspiration only from his
genius and his heart 

o proletaires  proletaires  how long are you to be victimized by this
spirit of revenge and implacable hatred which your false friends kindle 
and which  perhaps  has done more harm to the development of reformatory
ideas than the corruption  ignorance  and malice of the government 
believe me  at the present time everybody is to blame  in fact  in
intention  or in example  all are found wanting  and you have no right
to accuse any one  the king himself  god forgive me  i do not like to
justify a king    the king himself is  like his predecessors  only the
personification of an idea  and an idea  proletaires  which possesses
you yet  his greatest wrong consists in wishing for its complete
realization  while you wish it realized only partially   consequently 
in being logical in his government  while you  in your complaints  are
not at all so  you clamor for a second regicide  he that is without sin
among you   let him cast at the prince of property the first stone 

how successful you would have been if  in order to influence men 
you had appealed to the self love of men   if  in order to alter
the constitution and the law  you had placed yourselves within the
constitution and the law  fifty thousand laws  they say  make up our
political and civil codes  of these fifty thousand laws  twenty five
thousand are for you  twenty five thousand against you  is it not clear
that your duty is to oppose the former to the latter  and thus  by the
argument of contradiction  drive privilege into its last ditch  this
method of action is henceforth the only useful one  being the only moral
and rational one 

for my part  if i had the ear of this nation  to which i am attached by
birth and predilection  with no intention of playing the leading part
in the future republic  i would instruct the laboring masses to
conquer property through institutions and judicial pleadings  to seek
auxiliaries and accomplices in the highest ranks of society  and to ruin
all privileged classes by taking advantage of their common desire for
power and popularity 

the petition for the electoral reform has already received two hundred
thousand signatures  and the illustrious arago threatens us with a
million  surely  that will be well done  but from this million of
citizens  who are as willing to vote for an emperor as for equality 
could we not select ten thousand signatures  i mean bona fide
signatures  whose authors can read  write  cipher  and even think
a little  and whom we could invite  after due perusal and verbal
explanation  to sign such a petition as the following   



 to his excellency the minister of the interior   

 monsieur le ministre   on the day when a royal ordinance  decreeing
the establishment of model national workshops  shall appear in the
 moniteur   the undersigned  to the number of ten thousand  will repair
to the palace of the tuileries  and there  with all the power of their
lungs  will shout   long live louis philippe  

 on the day when the  moniteur  shall inform the public that this
petition is refused  the undersigned  to the number of ten thousand 
will say secretly in their hearts   down with louis philippe   


if i am not mistaken  such a petition would have some effect   75  the
pleasure of a popular ovation would be well worth the sacrifice of a few
millions  they sow so much to reap unpopularity  then  if the nation 
its hopes of 1830 restored  should feel it its duty to keep its
promise   and it would keep it  for the word of the nation is  like that
of god  sacred   if  i say  the nation  reconciled by this act with
the public spirited monarchy  should bear to the foot of the throne its
cheers and its vows  and should at that solemn moment choose me to speak
in its name  the following would be the substance of my speech   


 sire   this is what the nation wishes to say to your majesty   

 o king  you see what it costs to gain the applause of the citizens 
would you like us henceforth to take for our motto   let us help the
king  the king will help us   do you wish the people to cry   the king
and the french nation   then abandon these grasping bankers  these
quarrelsome lawyers  these miserable bourgeois  these infamous writers 
these dishonored men  all these  sire  hate you  and continue to support
you only because they fear us  finish the work of our kings  wipe out
aristocracy and privilege  consult with these faithful proletaires  with
the nation  which alone can honor a sovereign and sincerely shout   long
live the king   


the rest of what i have to say  sir  is for you alone  others would
not understand me  you are  i perceive  a republican as well as an
economist  and your patriotism revolts at the very idea of addressing
to the authorities a petition in which the government of louis philippe
should be tacitly recognized   national workshops  it were well to have
such institutions established   you think   but patriotic hearts never
will accept them from an aristocratic ministry  nor by the courtesy of a
king   already  undoubtedly  your old prejudices have returned  and you
now regard me only as a sophist  as ready to flatter the powers that
be as to dishonor  by pushing them to an extreme  the principles of
equality and universal fraternity 

what shall i say to you     that i should so lightly compromise the
future of my theories  either this clever sophistry which is attributed
to me must be at bottom a very trifling affair  or else my convictions
must be so firm that they deprive me of free will 

but  not to insist further on the necessity of a compromise between the
executive power and the people  it seems to me  sir  that  in doubting
my patriotism  you reason very capriciously  and that your judgments
are exceedingly rash  you  sir  ostensibly defending government and
property  are allowed to be a republican  reformer  phalansterian  any
thing you wish  i  on the contrary  demanding distinctly enough a slight
reform in public economy  am foreordained a conservative  and likewise
a friend of the dynasty  i cannot explain myself more clearly  so firm
a believer am i in the philosophy of accomplished facts and the  statu
quo  of governmental forms that  instead of destroying that which
exists and beginning over again the past  i prefer to render every thing
legitimate by correcting it  it is true that the corrections which i
propose  though respecting the form  tend to finally change the nature
of the things corrected  who denies it  but it is precisely that which
constitutes my system of  statu quo   i make no war upon symbols 
figures  or phantoms  i respect scarecrows  and bow before bugbears  i
ask  on the one hand  that property be left as it is  but that interest
on all kinds of capital be gradually lowered and finally abolished  on
the other hand  that the charter be maintained in its present shape  but
that method be introduced into administration and politics  that is all 
nevertheless  submitting to all that is  though not satisfied with it  i
endeavor to conform to the established order  and to render unto caesar
the things that are caesar s  is it thought  for instance  that i love
property     very well  i am myself a proprietor and do homage to the
right of increase  as is proved by the fact that i have creditors to
whom i faithfully pay  every year  a large amount of interest  the same
with politics  since we are a monarchy  i would cry   long live the
king   rather than suffer death  which does not prevent me  however 
from demanding that the irremovable  inviolable  and hereditary
representative of the nation shall act with the proletaires against the
privileged classes  in a word  that the king shall become the leader of
the radical party  thereby we proletaires would gain every thing  and i
am sure that  at this price  louis philippe might secure to his family
the perpetual presidency of the republic  and this is why i think so 

if there existed in france but one great functional inequality  the duty
of the functionary being  from one end of the year to the other  to hold
full court of savants  artists  soldiers  deputies  inspectors  &c  
it is evident that the expenses of the presidency then would be the
national expenses  and that  through the reversion of the civil list to
the mass of consumers  the great inequality of which i speak would form
an exact equation with the whole nation  of this no economist needs a
demonstration  consequently  there would be no more fear of cliques 
courtiers  and appanages  since no new inequality could be established 
the king  as king  would have friends  unheard of thing   but no family 
his relatives or kinsmen    agnats et cognats    if they were fools 
would be nothing to him  and in no case  with the exception of the heir
apparent  would they have  even in court  more privileges than others 
no more nepotism  no more favor  no more baseness  no one would go
to court save when duty required  or when called by an honorable
distinction  and as all conditions would be equal and all functions
equally honored  there would be no other emulation than that of merit
and virtue  i wish the king of the french could say without shame 
 my brother the gardener  my sister in law the milk maid  my son the
prince royal  and my son the blacksmith   his daughter might well be an
artist  that would be beautiful  sir  that would be royal  no one but a
buffoon could fail to understand it 

in this way  i have come to think that the forms of royalty may be
made to harmonize with the requirements of equality  and have given
a monarchical form to my republican spirit  i have seen that france
contains by no means as many democrats as is generally supposed  and
i have compromised with the monarchy  i do not say  however  that  if
france wanted a republic  i could not accommodate myself equally well 
and perhaps better  by nature  i hate all signs of distinction  crosses
of honor  gold lace  liveries  costumes  honorary titles  &c   and 
above all  parades  if i had my way  no general should be distinguished
from a soldier  nor a peer of france from a peasant  why have i never
taken part in a review  for i am happy to say  sir  that i am a national
guard  i have nothing else in the world but that  because the review is
always held at a place which i do not like  and because they have fools
for officers whom i am compelled to obey  you see   and this is not the
best of my history   that  in spite of my conservative opinions  my life
is a perpetual sacrifice to the republic 

nevertheless  i doubt if such simplicity would be agreeable to french
vanity  to that inordinate love of distinction and flattery which makes
our nation the most frivolous in the world  m  lamartine  in his grand
 meditation on bonaparte   calls the french a nation of brutuses  we are
merely a nation of narcissuses  previous to  89  we had the aristocracy
of blood  then every bourgeois looked down upon the commonalty  and
wished to be a nobleman  afterwards  distinction was based on wealth 
and the bourgeoisie jealous of the nobility  and proud of their money 
used 1830 to promote  not liberty by any means  but the aristocracy
of wealth  when  through the force of events  and the natural laws of
society  for the development of which france offers such free play 
equality shall be established in functions and fortunes  then the beaux
and the belles  the savants and the artists  will form new classes 
there is a universal and innate desire in this gallic country for fame
and glory  we must have distinctions  be they what they may   nobility 
wealth  talent  beauty  or dress  i suspect mm  arage and garnier pages
of having aristocratic manners  and i picture to myself our great
journalists  in their columns so friendly to the people  administering
rough kicks to the compositors in their printing offices 

 this man   once said  le national  in speaking of carrel   whom we
had proclaimed first consul     is it not true that the monarchical
principle still lives in the hearts of our democrats  and that they
want universal suffrage in order to make themselves kings  since  le
national  prides itself on holding more fixed opinions than  le journal
des debats   i presume that  armand carrel being dead  m  armand marrast
is now first consul  and m  garnier pages second consul  in every thing
the deputy must give way to the journalist  i do not speak of m 
arago  whom i believe to be  in spite of calumny  too learned for the
consulship  be it so  though we have consuls  our position is not much
altered  i am ready to yield my share of sovereignty to mm  armand
marrast and garnier pages  the appointed consuls  provided they will
swear on entering upon the duties of their office  to abolish property
and not be haughty 

forever promises  forever oaths  why should the people trust in
tribunes  when kings perjure themselves  alas  truth and honesty are no
longer  as in the days of king john  in the mouth of princes  a whole
senate has been convicted of felony  and  the interest of the governors
always being  for some mysterious reason  opposed to the interest of the
governed  parliaments follow each other while the nation dies of hunger 
no  no  no more protectors  no more emperors  no more consuls  better
manage our affairs ourselves than through agents  better associate our
industries than beg from monopolies  and  since the republic cannot
dispense with virtues  we should labor for our reform 

this  therefore  is my line of conduct  i preach emancipation to the
proletaires  association to the laborers  equality to the wealthy  i
push forward the revolution by all means in my power   the tongue 
the pen  the press  by action  and example  my life is a continual
apostleship 

yes  i am a reformer  i say it as i think it  in good faith  and that i
may be no longer reproached for my vanity  i wish to convert the world 
very likely this fancy springs from an enthusiastic pride which may have
turned to delirium  but it will be admitted at least that i have plenty
of company  and that my madness is not monomania  at the present day 
everybody wishes to be reckoned among the lunatics of beranger  to say
nothing of the babeufs  the marats  and the robespierres  who swarm in
our streets and workshops  all the great reformers of antiquity live
again in the most illustrious personages of our time  one is jesus
christ  another moses  a third mahomet  this is orpheus  that plato 
or pythagoras  gregory vii   himself  has risen from the grave together
with the evangelists and the apostles  and it may turn out that even i
am that slave who  having escaped from his master s house  was forthwith
made a bishop and a reformer by st  paul  as for the virgins and holy
women  they are expected daily  at present  we have only aspasias and
courtesans 

now  as in all diseases  the diagnostic varies according to the
temperament  so my madness has its peculiar aspects and distinguishing
characteristic 

reformers  as a general thing  are jealous of their role  they suffer no
rivals  they want no partners  they have disciples  but no co laborers 
it is my desire  on the contrary  to communicate my enthusiasm  and to
make it  as far as i can  epidemic  i wish that all were  like myself 
reformers  in order that there might be no more sects  and that christs 
anti christs  and false christs might be forced to understand and agree
with each other 

again  every reformer is a magician  or at least desires to become one 
thus moses  jesus christ  and the apostles  proved their mission by
miracles  mahomet ridiculed miracles after having endeavored to perform
them  fourier  more cunning  promises us wonders when the globe shall
be covered with phalansteries  for myself  i have as great a horror
of miracles as of authorities  and aim only at logic  that is why i
continually search after the criterion of certainty  i work for the
reformation of ideas  little matters it that they find me dry and
austere  i mean to conquer by a bold struggle  or die in the attempt 
and whoever shall come to the defence of property  i swear that i
will force him to argue like m  considerant  or philosophize like m 
troplong 

finally   and it is here that i differ most from my compeers   i do not
believe it necessary  in order to reach equality  to turn every thing
topsy turvy  to maintain that nothing but an overturn can lead to reform
is  in my judgment  to construct a syllogism  and to look for the truth
in the regions of the unknown  now  i am for generalization  induction 
and progress  i regard general disappropriation as impossible  attacked
from that point  the problem of universal association seems to me
insolvable  property is like the dragon which hercules killed  to
destroy it  it must be taken  not by the head  but by the tail   that
is  by profit and interest 

i stop  i have said enough to satisfy any one who can read and
understand  the surest way by which the government can baffle intrigues
and break up parties is to take possession of science  and point out to
the nation  at an already appreciable distance  the rising oriflamme of
equality  to say to those politicians of the tribune and the press  for
whose fruitless quarrels we pay so dearly   you are rushing forward 
blind as you are  to the abolition of property  but the government
marches with its eyes open  you hasten the future by unprincipled and
insincere controversy  but the government  which knows this future 
leads you thither by a happy and peaceful transition  the present
generation will not pass away before france  the guide and model of
civilized nations  has regained her rank and legitimate influence  

but  alas  the government itself   who shall enlighten it  who can
induce it to accept this doctrine of equality  whose terrible but
decisive formula the most generous minds hardly dare to acknowledge    
i feel my whole being tremble when i think that the testimony of
three men  yes  of three men who make it their business to teach and
define  would suffice to give full play to public opinion  to change
beliefs  and to fix destinies  will not the three men be found    

may we hope  or not  what must we think of those who govern us  in the
world of sorrow in which the proletaire moves  and where nothing is
known of the intentions of power  it must be said that despair prevails 
but you  sir   you  who by function belong to the official world  you 
in whom the people recognize one of their noblest friends  and
property its most prudent adversary   what say you of our deputies  our
ministers  our king  do you believe that the authorities are friendly
to us  then let the government declare its position  let it print its
profession of faith in equality  and i am dumb  otherwise  i shall
continue the war  and the more obstinacy and malice is shown  the
oftener will i redouble my energy and audacity  i have said before  and
i repeat it   i have sworn  not on the dagger and the death s head  amid
the horrors of a catacomb  and in the presence of men besmeared with
blood  but i have sworn on my conscience to pursue property  to grant it
neither peace nor truce  until i see it everywhere execrated  i have not
yet published half the things that i have to say concerning the right of
domain  nor the best things  let the knights of property  if there are
any who fight otherwise than by retreating  be prepared every day for
a new demonstration and accusation  let them enter the arena armed with
reason and knowledge  not wrapped up in sophisms  for justice will be
done 


 to become enlightened  we must have liberty  that alone suffices 
but it must be the liberty to use the reason in regard to all public
matters 

 and yet we hear on every hand authorities of all kinds and degrees
crying   do not reason  

 if a distinction is wanted  here is one   

 the public use of the reason always should be free  but the private
use ought always to be rigidly restricted  by public use  i mean the
scientific  literary use  by private  that which may be taken advantage
of by civil officials and public functionaries  since the governmental
machinery must be kept in motion  in order to preserve unity and attain
our object  we must not reason  we must obey  but the same individual
who is bound  from this point of view  to passive obedience  has the
right to speak in his capacity of citizen and scholar  he can make an
appeal to the public  submit to it his observations on events which
occur around him and in the ranks above him  taking care  however  to
avoid offences which are punishable 

 reason  then  as much as you like  only  obey    kant  fragment on the
liberty of thought and of the press  tissot s translation 


these words of the great philosopher outline for me my duty  i have
delayed the reprint of the work entitled  what is property   in order
that i might lift the discussion to the philosophical height from which
ridiculous clamor has dragged it down  and that  by a new presentation
of the question  i might dissipate the fears of good citizens  i now
reenter upon the public use of my reason  and give truth full swing  the
second edition of the first memoir on property will immediately follow
the publication of this letter  before issuing any thing further  i
shall await the observations of my critics  and the co operation of the
friends of the people and of equality 

hitherto  i have spoken in my own name  and on my own personal
responsibility  it was my duty  i was endeavoring to call attention to
principles which antiquity could not discover  because it knew nothing
of the science which reveals them   political economy  i have  then 
testified as to facts  in short  i have been a witness  now my role
changes  it remains for me to deduce the practical consequences of the
facts proclaimed  the position of public prosecutor is the only one
which i am henceforth fitted to fill  and i shall sum up the case in the
name of the people 

i am  sir  with all the consideration that i owe to your talent and your
character

p s  during the session of april 2  the chamber of deputies rejected 
by a very large majority  the literary property bill  because it did not
understand it  nevertheless  literary property is only a special form of
the right of property  which everybody claims to understand  let us hope
that this legislative precedent will not be fruitless for the cause of
equality  the consequence of the vote of the chamber is the abolition
of capitalistic property   property incomprehensible  contradictory

to whom i have been indebted  since my first publication  for assistance

that one may acknowledge it graciously and freely  i have always
thought  for my part  that bad institutions made bad magistrates  just
as the cowardice and hypocrisy of certain bodies results solely from the
spirit which governs them  why  for instance  in spite of the virtues
and talents for which they are so noted  are the academies generally

 footnote 12  here  especially  the simplicity of our ancestors appears
in all its rudeness  after having made first cousins heirs  where there
were no legitimate children  they could not so divide the property
between two different branches as to prevent the simultaneous existence
of extreme wealth and extreme poverty in the same family  for example   
james  dying  leaves two sons  peter and john  heirs of his fortune 
james s property is divided equally between them  but peter has only one
daughter  while john  his brother  leaves six sons  it is clear that  to
be true to the principle of equality  and at the same time to that of
heredity  the two estates must be divided in seven equal portions among
the children of peter and john  for otherwise a stranger might marry
peter s daughter  and by this alliance half of the property of james 
the grandfather  would be transferred to another family  which is
contrary to the principle of heredity  furthermore  john s children
would be poor on account of their number  while their cousin  being an
only child  would be rich  which is contrary to the principle of
equality  if we extend this combined application of two principles
apparently opposed to each other  we shall become convinced that the
right of succession  which is assailed with so little wisdom in our day 
is no obstacle to the maintenance of equality

statues  groves  fountains  and flowers  be set apart as a special

consequently  far from advocating what is now called the emancipation of
woman  i should incline  rather  if there were no other alternative  to
exclude her from society

 footnote 28  it would be interesting and profitable to review the
authors who have written on usury  or  to use the gentler expression
which some prefer  lendingat interest  the theologians always have
opposed usury  but  since they have admitted always the legitimacy of
rent  and since rent is evidently identical with interest  they have
lost themselves in a labyrinth of subtle distinctions  and have finally
reached a pass where they do not know what to think of usury  the
church  the teacher of morality  so jealous and so proud of the purity
of her doctrine  has always been ignorant of the real nature of property
and usury  she even has proclaimed through her pontiffs the most
deplorable errors   non potest mutuum   said benedict xiv    locationi
ullo pacto comparari    rent   says bossuet   is as far from usury as
heaven is from the earth   how  on sic  such a doctrine  condemn lending
at interest  how justify the gospel  which expressly forbids usury  the
difficulty of theologians is a very serious one  unable to refute the
economical demonstrations  which rightly assimilate interest to rent 
they no longer dare to condemn interest  and they can say only that
there must be such a thing as usury  since the gospel forbids it  

 footnote 29   i preach the gospel  i live by the gospel   said the
apostle  meaning thereby that he lived by his labor  the catholic clergy
prefer to live by property  the struggles in the communes of the middle
ages between the priests and bishops and the large proprietors and
seigneurs are famous  the papal excommunications fulminated in defence
of ecclesiastical revenues are no less so  even to day  the official
organs of the gallican clergy still maintain that the pay received by
the clergy is not a salary  but an indemnity for goods of which they
were once proprietors  and which were taken from them in  89 by the
third estate  the clergy prefer to live by the right of increase rather
than by labor  

 footnote 30  the meaning ordinarily attached to the word  anarchy  is
absence of principle  absence of rule  consequently  it has been
regarded as synonymous with  disorder   

 footnote 31  if such ideas are ever forced into the minds of the
people  it will be by representative government and the tyranny of
talkers  once science  thought  and speech were characterized by the
same expression  to designate a thoughtful and a learned man  they said 
 a man quick to speak and powerful in discourse   for a long time 
speech has been abstractly distinguished from science and reason 
gradually  this abstraction is becoming realized  as the logicians say 
in society  so that we have to day savants of many kinds who talk but
little  and talkers who are not even savants in the science of speech 
thus a philosopher is no longer a savant  he is a talker  legislators
and poets were once profound and sublime characters  now they are
talkers  a talker is a sonorous bell  whom the least shock suffices to
set in perpetual motion  with the talker  the flow of speech is always
directly proportional to the poverty of thought  talkers govern the
world  they stun us  they bore us  they worry us  they suck our blood 
and laugh at us  as for the savants  they keep silence  if they wish to
say a word  they are cut short  let them write

 footnote 33  in a monthly publication  the first number of which has
just appeared under the name of  l egalitaire   self sacrifice is laid
down as a principle of equality  this is a confusion of ideas  self 
sacrifice  taken alone  is the last degree of inequality  to seek
equality in self sacrifice is to confess that equality is against
nature  equality must be based upon justice  upon strict right  upon the
principles invoked by the proprietor himself  otherwise it will never
exist  self sacrifice is superior to justice  but it cannot be imposed
as law  because it is of such a nature as to admit of no reward  it is 
indeed  desirable that everybody shall recognize the necessity of self 
sacrifice  and the idea of  l egalitaire  is an excellent example 
unfortunately  it can have no effect  what would you reply  indeed  to a
man who should say to you   i do not want to sacrifice myself   is he to
be compelled to do so  when self sacrifice is forced  it becomes
oppression  slavery  the exploitation of man by man  thus have the
proletaires sacrificed themselves to property  

 footnote 34  the disciples of fourier have long seemed to me the most
advanced of all modern socialists  and almost the only ones worthy of
the name  if they had understood the nature of their task  spoken to the
people  awakened their sympathies  and kept silence when they did not
understand  if they had made less extravagant pretensions  and had shown
more respect for public intelligence   perhaps the reform would now 
thanks to them  be in progress  but why are these earnest reformers
continually bowing to power and wealth   that is  to all that is anti 
reformatory  how  in a thinking age  can they fail to see that the world
must be converted by demonstration  not by myths and allegories  why do
they  the deadly enemies of civilization  borrow from it  nevertheless 
its most pernicious fruits   property  inequality of fortune and rank 
gluttony  concubinage  prostitution  what do i know  theurgy  magic  and
sorcery  why these endless denunciations of morality  metaphysics  and
psychology  when the abuse of these sciences  which they do not
understand  constitutes their whole system  why this mania for deifying
a man whose principal merit consisted in talking nonsense about things
whose names  even  he did not know  in the strongest language ever put
upon paper  whoever admits the infallibility of a man becomes thereby
incapable of instructing others  whoever denies his own reason will soon
proscribe free thought  the phalansterians would not fail to do it if
they had the power  let them condescend to reason  let them proceed
systematically  let them give us demonstrations instead of revelations 
and we will listen willingly  then let them organize manufactures 
agriculture  and commerce  let them make labor attractive  and the most
humble functions honorable  and our praise shall be theirs  above all 
let them throw off that illuminism which gives them the appearance of
impostors or dupes  rather than believers and apostles  

 footnote 35  individual possession is no obstacle to extensive
cultivation and unity of exploitation  if i have not spoken of the
drawbacks arising from small estates  it is because i thought it useless
to repeat what so many others have said  and what by this time all the
world must know  but i am surprised that the economists  who have so
clearly shown the disadvantages of spade husbandry  have failed to see
that it is caused entirely by property  above all  that they have not
perceived that their plan for mobilizing the soil is a first step
towards the abolition of property

the glory of the abolition of slavery   to this end   he says   many
causes were necessary   the evolution of other ideas and other
principles of civilization   so general an assertion cannot be refuted 
some of these ideas and causes should have been pointed out  that we
might judge whether their source was not wholly christian  or whether at
least the christian spirit had not penetrated and thus fructified them

of god and the salvation of my soul

 footnote 59  the spirit of despotism and monopoly which animated the
communes has not escaped the attention of historians   the formation of
the commoners  associations   says meyer   did not spring from the true
spirit of liberty  but from the desire for exemption from the charges of
the seigniors  from individual interests  and jealousy of the welfare of
others     each commune or corporation opposed the creation of every
other  and this spirit increased to such an extent that the king of
england  henry v   having established a university at caen  in 1432  the
city and university of paris opposed the registration of the edict   

 footnote 60  feudalism was  in spirit and in its providential destiny 
a long protest of the human personality against the monkish communism
with which europe  in the middle ages  was overrun  after the orgies of
pagan selfishness  society  carried to the opposite extreme by the
christian religion  risked its life by unlimited self denial and
absolute indifference to the pleasures of the world  feudalism was the
balance weight which saved europe from the combined influence of the
religious communities and the manlchean sects which had sprung up since
the fourth century under different names and in different countries 
modern civilization is indebted to feudalism for the definitive
establishment of the person  of marriage  of the family  and of country 
 see  on this subject  guizot   history of civilization in europe    

 footnote 61  this was made evident in july  1830  and the years which
followed it  when the electoral bourgeoisie effected a revolution in
order to get control over the king  and suppressed the emeutes in order
to restrain the people  the bourgeoisie  through the jury  the
magistracy  its position in the army  and its municipal despotism 
governs both royalty and the people  it is the bourgeoisie which  more
than any other class  is conservative and retrogressive  it is the
bourgeoisie which makes and unmakes ministries  it is the bourgeoisie
which has destroyed the influence of the upper chamber  and which will
dethrone the king whenever he shall become unsatisfactory to it  it is
to please the bourgeoisie that royalty makes itself unpopular  it is the
bourgeoisie which is troubled at the hopes of the people  and which
hinders reform  the journals of the bourgeoisie are the ones which
preach morality and religion to us  while reserving scepticism and
indifference for themselves  which attack personal government  and favor
the denial of the electoral privilege to those who have no property  the
bourgeoisie will accept any thing rather than the emancipation of the
proletariat  as soon as it thinks its privileges threatened  it will
unite with royalty  and who does not know that at this very moment these
two antagonists have suspended their quarrels     it has been a question
of property  

 footnote 62  the same opinion was recently expressed from the tribune

 footnote 63  a professor of comparative legislation  m  lerminier  has

equality  speaking to the priests   and for that reason your possessions
were given you  in your hands they were at once an instrument and a
reward  but you do not now deserve them  for you long since ceased to
civilize any thing whatever

 footnote 67  armand carrel would have favored the fortification of the
capital   le national  has said  again and again  placing the name of
its old editor by the side of the names of napoleon and vauban  what
signifies this exhumation of an anti popular politician  it signifies
that armand carrel wished to make government an individual and
irremovable  but elective  property  and that he wished this property to
be elected  not by the people  but by the army  the political system of
carrel was simply a reorganization of the pretorian guards  carrel also
hated the  pequins   that which he deplored in the revolution of july
was not  they say  the insurrection of the people  but the victory of
the people over the soldiers  that is the reason why carrel  after 1830 
would never support the patriots   do you answer me with a few
regiments   he asked  armand carrel regarded the army  the military
power  as the basis of law and government  this man undoubtedly had a
moral sense within him  but he surely had no sense of justice  were he
still in this world  i declare it boldly  liberty would have no greater
enemy than carrel  

 footnote 68  in a very short article  which was read by m  wolowski  m 
louis blanc declares  in substance  that he is not a communist  which i
easily believe   that one must be a fool to attack property  but he does
not say why   and that it is very necessary to guard against confounding
property with its abuses  when voltaire overthrew christianity  he
repeatedly avowed that he had no spite against religion  but only
against its abuses  

 footnote 69  the property fever is at its height among writers and
artists  and it is curious to see the complacency with which our
legislators and men of letters cherish this devouring passion  an artist
sells a picture  and then  the merchandise delivered  assumes to prevent
the purchaser from selling engravings  under the pretext that he  the
painter  in selling the original  has not sold his design  a dispute
arises between the amateur and the artist in regard to both the fact and
the law  m  villemain  the minister of public instruction  being
consulted as to this particular case  finds that the painter is right 
only the property in the design should have been specially reserved in
the contract  so that  in reality  m  villemain recognizes in the artist
a power to surrender his work and prevent its communication  thus
contradicting the legal axiom  one cannot give and keep at the same
time  a strange reasoner is m  villemain  an ambiguous principle leads
to a false conclusion  instead of rejecting the principle  m  villemain
hastens to admit the conclusion  with him the  reductio ad absurdum  is
a convincing argument  thus he is made official defender of literary
property  sure of being understood and sustained by a set of loafers 
the disgrace of literature and the plague of public morals  why  then 
does m  villemain feel so strong an interest in setting himself up as
the chief of the literary classes  in playing for their benefit the role
of trissotin in the councils of the state  and in becoming the
accomplice and associate of a band of profligates    soi disant  men of
letters   who for more than ten years have labored with such deplorable
success to ruin public spirit  and corrupt the heart by warping the
mind  

 footnote 70  m  leroux has been highly praised in a review for having

the manicheans admit two co existent and eternal principles   god and
matter  spirit and flesh  light and darkness  good and evil  but  unlike
the phalansterians  who pretend to reconcile the two  the manicheans
make war upon matter  and labor with all their might for the destruction
of the flesh  by condemning marriage and forbidding reproduction   which
does not prevent them  however  from indulging in all the carnal
pleasures which the intensest lust can conceive of  in this last
particular  the tendency of the fourieristic morality is quite
manichean 

the gnostics do not differ from the early christians  as their name
indicates  they regarded themselves as inspired  fourier  who held
peculiar ideas concerning the visions of somnambulists  and who believed
in the possibility of developing the magnetic power to such an extent as
to enable us to commune with invisible beings  might  if he were living

good  are reversed pelagians  they give all to grace  and nothing to

the socinians  deists in all other respects  admit an original
revelation  many people are socinians to day  who do not suspect it  and
who regard their opinions as new 

the neo christians are those simpletons who admire christianity because
it has produced bells and cathedrals  base in soul  corrupt in heart 
dissolute in mind and senses  the neo christians seek especially after
the external form  and admire religion  as they love women  for its
physical beauty  they believe in a coming revelation  as well as a
transfiguration of catholicism  they will sing masses at the grand
spectacle in the phalanstery  

 footnote 73  it should be understood that the above refers only to the
moral and political doctrines of fourier   doctrines which  like all
philosophical and religious systems  have their root and  raison
d existence  in society itself  and for this reason deserve to be
examined  the peculiar speculations of fourier and his sect concerning
cosmogony  geology  natural history  physiology  and psychology  i leave
to the attention of those who would think it their duty to seriously
refute the fables of blue beard and the ass s skin  

 footnote 74  a writer for the radical press  m  louis raybaud  said  in
the preface to his  studies of contemporary reformers    who does not
know that morality is relative  aside from a few grand sentiments which
are strikingly instinctive  the measure of human acts varies with
nations and climates  and only civilization  the progressive education
of the race  can lead to a universal morality     the absolute escapes
our contingent and finite nature  the absolute is the secret of god  
god keep from evil m  louis raybaud  but i cannot help remarking that
all political apostates begin by the negation of the absolute  which is
really the negation of truth  what can a writer  who professes
scepticism  have in common with radical views  what has he to say to his
readers  what judgment is he entitled to pass upon contemporary
reformers  m  raybaud thought it would seem wise to repeat an old
impertinence of the legist  and that may serve him for an excuse  we all
have these weaknesses  but i am surprised that a man of so much
intelligence as m  raybaud  who studies systems  fails to see the very
thing he ought first to recognize   namely  that systems are the
progress of the mind towards the absolute  

 footnote 75  the electoral reform  it is continually asserted  is not
an end  but a means  undoubtedly  but what  then  is the end  why not
furnish an unequivocal explanation of its object  how can the people
choose their representatives  unless they know in advance the purpose
for which they choose them  and the object of the commission which they
entrust to them  but  it is said  the very business of those chosen by
the people is to find out the object of the reform  that is a quibble 
what is to hinder these persons  who are to be elected in future  from
first seeking for this object  and then  when they have found it  from
communicating it to the people  the reformers have well said  that 
while the object of the electoral reform remains in the least
indefinite  it will be only a means of transferring power from the hands
of petty tyrants to the hands of other tyrants  we know already how a
nation may be oppressed by being led to believe that it is obeying only
its own laws  the history of universal suffrage  among all nations  is
the history of the restrictions of liberty by and in the name of the
multitude  still  if the electoral reform  in its present shape  were
rational  practical  acceptable to clean consciences and upright minds 
perhaps one might be excused  though ignorant of its object  for
supporting it  but  no  the text of the petition determines nothing 
makes no distinctions  requires no conditions  no guarantee  it
establishes the right without the duty   every frenchman is a voter  and
eligible to office   as well say   every bayonet is intelligent  every
savage is civilized  every slave is free   in its vague generality  the
reformatory petition is the weakest of abstractions  or the highest form
of political treason  consequently  the enlightened patriots distrust
and despise each other  the most radical writer of the time   he whose
economical and social theories are  without comparison  the most
advanced   m  leroux  has taken a bold stand against universal suffrage
and democratic government  and has written an exceedingly keen criticism
of j  j  rousseau  that is undoubtedly the reason why m  leroux is no
longer the philosopher of  le national   that journal  like napoleon 
does not like men of ideas  nevertheless   le national  ought to know
that he who fights against ideas will perish by ideas
