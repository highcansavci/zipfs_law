the kingdom of god is within you
christianity not as a mystic religion
but as a new theory of life

translators preface 

the book i have had the privilege of translating is  undoubtedly 
one of the most remarkable studies of the social and psychological
condition of the modern world which has appeared in europe for
many years  and its influence is sure to be lasting and far
reaching   tolstois genius is beyond dispute   the verdict of the
civilized world has pronounced him as perhaps the greatest
novelist of our generation   but the philosophical and religious
works of his later years have met with a somewhat indifferent
reception   they have been much talked about  simply because they
were his work  but  as tolstoi himself complains  they have never
been seriously discussed   i hardly think that he will have to
repeat the complaint in regard to the present volume   one may
disagree with his views  but no one can seriously deny the
originality  boldness  and depth of the social conception which he
develops with such powerful logic   the novelist has shown in this
book the religious fervor and spiritual insight of the prophet 
yet one is pleased to recognize that the artist is not wholly lost
in the thinker   the subtle intuitive perception of the
psychological basis of the social position  the analysis of the
frame of mind of oppressors and oppressed  and of the intoxication
of authority and servility  as well as the purely descriptive
passages in the last chapterthese could only have come from the
author of war and peace 

the book will surely give all classes of readers much to think of 
and must call forth much criticism   it must be refuted by those
who disapprove of its teaching  if they do not want it to have
great influence 

one cannot of course anticipate that english people  slow as they
are to be influenced by ideas  and instinctively distrustful of
all that is logical  will take a leap in the dark and attempt to
put tolstois theory of life into practice   but one may at least
be sure that his destructive criticism of the present social and
political r√©gime will become a powerful force in the work of
disintegration and social reconstruction which is going on around
us   many earnest thinkers who  like tolstoi  are struggling to
find their way out of the contradictions of our social order will
hail him as their spiritual guide   the individuality of the
author is felt in every line of his work  and even the most
prejudiced cannot resist the fascination of his genuineness 
sincerity  and profound earnestness   whatever comes from a heart
such as his  swelling with anger and pity at the sufferings of
humanity  cannot fail to reach the hearts of others   no reader
can put down the book without feeling himself better and more
truthloving for having read it 

many readers may be disappointed with the opening chapters of the
book   tolstoi disdains all attempt to captivate the reader   he
begins by laying what he considers to be the logical foundation of
his doctrines  stringing together quotations from littleknown
theological writers  and he keeps his own incisive logic for the
later part of the book 

one word as to the translation   tolstois style in his religious
and philosophical works differs considerably from that of his
novels   he no longer cares about the form of his work  and his
style is often slipshod  involved  and diffuse   it has been my
aim to give a faithful reproduction of the original

preface 

in the year 1884 i wrote a book under the title what i believe 
in which i did in fact make a sincere statement of my beliefs 

in affirming my belief in christs teaching  i could not help
explaining why i do not believe  and consider as mistaken  the
churchs doctrine  which is usually called christianity 

among the many points in which this doctrine falls short of the
doctrine of christ i pointed out as the principal one the absence
of any commandment of nonresistance to evil by force   the
perversion of christs teaching by the teaching of the church is
more clearly apparent in this than in any other point of
difference 

i knowas we all dovery little of the practice and the spoken and
written doctrine of former times on the subject of nonresistance to
evil  i knew what had been said on the subject by the fathers of the
churchorigen  tertullian  and othersi knew too of the existence of
some socalled sects of mennonites  herrnhuters  and quakers  who do not
allow a christian the use of weapons  and do not enter military service 
but i knew little of what had been done by these socalled sects toward
expounding the question 

my book was  as i had anticipated  suppressed by the russian
censorship  but partly owing to my literary reputation  partly
because the book had excited peoples curiosity  it circulated in
manuscript and in lithographed copies in russia and through
translations abroad  and it evolved  on one side  from those who
shared my convictions  a series of essays with a great deal of
information on the subject  on the other side a series of
criticisms on the principles laid down in my book 

a great deal was made clear to me by both hostile and sympathetic
criticism  and also by the historical events of late years  and i
was led to fresh results and conclusions  which i wish now to
expound 

first i will speak of the information i received on the history of
the question of nonresistance to evil  then of the views of this
question maintained by spiritual critics  that is  by professed
believers in the christian religion  and also by temporal ones 
that is  those who do not profess the christian religion  and
lastly i will speak of the conclusions to which i have been
brought by all this in the light of the historical events of late
years

chapter i 

the doctrine of nonresistance to evil by force has been professed
by a minority of men from the very foundation of christianity 

of the book what i believethe correspondence evoked by itletters
from quakersgarrisons declarationadin ballou  his works  his
catechismhelchitskys net of faiththe attitude of the world to
works elucidating christs teachingdymonds book on warmusser s
nonresistance assertedattitude of the government in 1818 to men who
refused to serve in the armyhostile attitude of governments generally
and of liberals to those who refuse to assist in acts of state violence 
and their conscious efforts to silence and suppress these manifestations
of christian nonresistance 


among the first responses called forth by my book were some letters from
american quakers  in these letters  expressing their sympathy with my
views on the unlawfulness for a christian of war and the use of force of
any kind  the quakers gave me details of their own socalled sect  which
for more than two hundred years has actually professed the teaching of
christ on nonresistance to evil by force  and does not make use of
weapons in selfdefense  the quakers sent me books  from which i learnt
how they had  years ago  established beyond doubt the duty for a
christian of fulfilling the command of nonresistance to evil by force 
and had exposed the error of the churchs teaching in allowing war and
capital punishment 

in a whole series of arguments and texts showing that warthat
is  the wounding and killing of menis inconsistent with a
religion founded on peace and good will toward men  the quakers
maintain and prove that nothing has contributed so much to the
obscuring of christian truth in the eyes of the heathen  and has
hindered so much the diffusion of christianity through the world 
as the disregard of this command by men calling themselves
christians  and the permission of war and violence to christians 

christs teaching  which came to be known to men  not by means of
violence and the sword  they say  but by means of nonresistance
to evil  gentleness  meekness  and peaceableness  can only be
diffused through the world by the example of peace  harmony  and
love among its followers 

a christian  according to the teaching of god himself  can act
only peaceably toward all men  and therefore there can be no
authority able to force the christian to act in opposition to the
teaching of god and to the principal virtue of the christian in
his relation with his neighbors 

the law of state necessity  they say  can force only those to
change the law of god who  for the sake of earthly gains  try to
reconcile the irreconcilable  but for a christian who sincerely
believes that following christs teaching will give him salvation 
such considerations of state can have no force 

further acquaintance with the labors of the quakers and their
workswith fox  penn  and especially the work of dymond
published in 1827showed me not only that the impossibility of
reconciling christianity with force and war had been recognized
long  long ago  but that this irreconcilability had been long ago
proved so clearly and so indubitably that one could only wonder
how this impossible reconciliation of christian teaching with the
use of force  which has been  and is still  preached in the
churches  could have been maintained in spite of it 

in addition to what i learned from the quakers i received about
the same time  also from america  some information on the subject
from a source perfectly distinct and previously unknown to me 

the son of william lloyd garrison  the famous champion of the
emancipation of the negroes  wrote to me that he had read my book  in
which he found ideas similar to those expressed by his father in the
year 1838  and that  thinking it would be interesting to me to know
this  he sent me a declaration or proclamation of nonresistance drawn
up by his father nearly fifty years ago 

this declaration came about under the following circumstances
william lloyd garrison took part in a discussion on the means of
suppressing war in the society for the establishment of peace
among men  which existed in 1838 in americ   he came to the
conclusion that the establishment of universal peace can only be
founded on the open profession of the doctrine of nonresistance
to evil by violence matt  v  39  in its full significance  as
understood by the quakers  with whom garrison happened to be on
friendly relations  having come to this conclusion  garrison
thereupon composed and laid before the society a declaration 
which was signed at the timein 1838by many members 

   declaration of sentiments adopted by peace convention 
   boston  1838 

   we the undersigned  regard it as due to ourselves  to the
   cause which we love  to the country in which we live  to
   publish a declaration expressive of the purposes we aim to
   accomplish and the measures we shall adopt to carry forward the
   work of peaceful universal reformation 

   we do not acknowledge allegiance to any human government   we
   recognize but one king and lawgiver  one judge and ruler of
   mankind   our country is the world  our countrymen are all
   mankind   we love the land of our nativity only as we love all
   other lands   the interests and rights of american citizens are
   not dearer to us than those of the whole human race   hence we
   can allow no appeal to patriotism to revenge any national
   insult or injury   

   we conceive that a nation has no right to defend itself
   against foreign enemies or to punish its invaders  and no
   individual possesses that right in his own case  and the unit
   cannot be of greater importance than the aggregate   if
   soldiers thronging from abroad with intent to commit rapine and
   destroy life may not be resisted by the people or the
   magistracy  then ought no resistance to be offered to domestic
   troublers of the public peace or of private security 

   the dogma that all the governments of the world are
   approvingly ordained of god  and that the powers that be in the
   united states  in russia  in turkey  are in accordance with his
   will  is no less absurd than impious   it makes the impartial
   author of our existence unequal and tyrannical  it cannot be
   affirmed that the powers that be in any nation are actuated by
   the spirit or guided by the example of christ in the treatment
   of enemies  therefore they cannot be agreeable to the will of
   god  and therefore their overthrow by a spiritual regeneration
   of their subjects is inevitable 

   we regard as unchristian and unlawful not only all wars 
   whether offensive or defensive  but all preparations for war 
   every naval ship  every arsenal  every fortification  we regard
   as unchristian and unlawful  the existence of any kind of
    standing army  all military chieftains  all monuments
   commemorative of victory over a fallen foe  all trophies won in
   battle  all celebrations in honor of military exploits  all
   appropriations for defense by arms  we regard as unchristian
   and unlawful every edict of government requiring of its
   subjects military service 

   hence we deem it unlawful to bear arms  and we cannot hold any
   office which imposes on its incumbent the obligation to compel
   men to do right on pain of imprisonment or death   we therefore
   voluntarily exclude ourselves from every legislative and
   judicial body  and repudiate all human politics  worldly
   honors  and stations of authority   if we cannot occupy a seat
   in the legislature or on the bench  neither can we elect others
   to act as our substitutes in any such capacity   it follows
   that we cannot sue any man at law to force him to return
   anything he may have wrongly taken from us  if he has seized
   our coat  we shall surrender him our cloak also rather than
   subject him to punishment 

   we believe that the penal code of the old covenantan eye for
   an eye  and a tooth for a toothhas been abrogated by jesus
   christ  and that under the new covenant the forgiveness instead
   of the punishment of enemies has been enjoined on all his
   disciples in all cases whatsoever   to extort money from
   enemies  cast them into prison  exile or execute them  is
   obviously not to forgive but to take retribution 

   the history of mankind is crowded with evidences proving that
   physical coercion is not adapted to moral regeneration  and
   that the sinful dispositions of men can be subdued only by
   love  that evil can be exterminated only by good  that it is
   not safe to rely upon the strength of an arm to preserve us
   from harm  that there is great security in being gentle 
   longsuffering  and abundant in mercy  that it is only the meek
   who shall inherit the earth  for those who take up the sword
   shall perish by the sword 

   hence as a measure of sound policyof safety to property 
   life  and libertyof public quietude and private enjoymentas
   well as on the ground of allegiance to him who is king of kings
   and lord of lords  we cordially adopt the nonresistance
   principle  being confident that it provides for all possible
   consequences  is armed with omnipotent power  and must
   ultimately triumph over every assailing force 

   we advocate no jacobinical doctrines   the spirit of
   jacobinism is the spirit of retaliation  violence  and murder 
   it neither fears god nor regards man   we would be filled with
   the spirit of christ   if we abide evil by our fundamental
   principle of not opposing evil by evil we cannot participate in
   sedition  treason  or violence   we shall submit to every
   ordinance and every requirement of government  except such as
   are contrary to the commands of the gospel  and in no case
   resist the operation of law  except by meekly submitting to the
   penalty of disobedience 

   but while we shall adhere to the doctrine of nonresistance
   and passive submission to enemies  we purpose  in a moral and
   spiritual sense  to assail iniquity in high places and in low
   places  to apply our principles to all existing evil 
   political  legal  and ecclesiastical institutions  and to
   hasten the time when the kingdoms of this world will have
   become the kingdom of our lord jesus christ   it appears to us
   a selfevident truth that whatever the gospel is designed to
   destroy at any period of the world  being contrary to it  ought
   now to be abandoned   if  then  the time is predicted when
   swords shall be beaten into plowshares and spears into pruning
   hooks  and men shall not learn the art of war any more  it
   follows that all who manufacture  sell  or wield these deadly
   weapons do thus array themselves against the peaceful dominion
   of the son of god on earth 

   having thus stated our principles  we proceed to specify the
   measures we propose to adopt in carrying our object into
   effect 

   we expect to prevail through the foolishness of preaching   we
   shall endeavor to promulgate our views among all persons  to
   whatever nation  sect  or grade of society they may belong 
   hence we shall organize public lectures  circulate tracts and
   publications  form societies  and petition every governing
   body   it will be our leading object to devise ways and means
   for effecting a radical change in the views  feelings  and
   practices of society respecting the sinfulness of war and the
   treatment of enemies 

   in entering upon the great work before us  we are not
   unmindful that in its prosecution we may be called to test
   our sincerity even as in a fiery ordeal   it may subject us to
   insult  outrage  suffering  yea  even death itself   we
   anticipate no small amount of misconception  misrepresentation 
   and calumny   tumults may arise against us   the proud and
   pharisaical  the ambitious and tyrannical  principalities and
   powers  may combine to crush us   so they treated the messiah
   whose example we are humbly striving to imitate   we shall not
   be afraid of their terror   our confidence is in the lord
   almighty and not in man   having withdrawn from human
   protection  what can sustain us but that faith which overcomes
   the world   we shall not think it strange concerning the fiery
   trial which is to try us  but rejoice inasmuch as we are
   partakers of christs sufferings 

   wherefore we commit the keeping of our souls to god  for every
   one that forsakes houses  or brethren  or sisters  or father 
   or mother  or wife  or children  or lands for christs sake 
   shall receive a hundredfold  and shall inherit everlasting
   life 

   firmly relying upon the certain and universal triumph of the
   sentiments contained in this declaration  however formidable
   may be the opposition arrayed against them  we hereby affix our
   signatures to it  commending it to the reason and conscience of
   mankind  and resolving  in the strength of the lord god  to
   calmly and meekly abide the issue 

immediately after this declaration a society for nonresistance was
founded by garrison  and a journal called the nonresistant  in
which the doctrine of nonresistance was advocated in its full
significance and in all its consequences  as it had been expounded
in the declaration   further information as to the ultimate
destiny of the society and the journal i gained from the excellent
biography of w  l  garrison  the work of his son 

the society and the journal did not exist for long   the
greater number of garrisons fellowworkers in the movement for
the liberation of the slaves  fearing that the too radical
programme of the journal  the nonresistant  might keep people
away from the practical work of negroemancipation  gave up the
profession of the principle of nonresistance as it had been
expressed in the declaration  and both society and journal ceased
to exist 

this declaration of garrisons gave so powerful and eloquent an
expression of a confession of faith of such importance to men 
that one would have thought it must have produced a strong
impression on people  and have become known throughout the world
and the subject of discussion on every side   but nothing of the
kind occurred   not only was it unknown in europe  even the
americans  who have such a high opinion of garrison  hardly knew
of the declaration 

another champion of nonresistance has been overlooked in the same
waythe american adin ballou  who lately died  after spending fifty
years in preaching this doctrine  lord god  to calmly and meekly abide
the doctrine  how great the ignorance is of everything relating to the
question of nonresistance may be seen from the fact that garrison the
son  who has written an excellent biography of his father in four great
volumes  in answer to my inquiry whether there are existing now
societies for nonresistance  and adherents of the doctrine  told me
that as far as he knew that society had broken up  and that there were
no adherents of that doctrine  while at the very time when he was
writing to me there was living  at hopedale in massachusetts  adin
ballou  who had taken part in the labors of garrison the father  and had
devoted fifty years of his life to advocating  both orally and in print 
the doctrine of nonresistance  later on i received a letter from wilson 
a pupil and colleague of ballous  and entered into correspondence with
ballou himself  i wrote to ballou  and he answered me and sent me his
works  here is the summary of some extracts from them

   jesus christ is my lord and teacher  says ballou in one of
   his essays exposing the inconsistency of christians who allowed
   a right of selfdefense and of warfare   i have promised
   leaving all else  to follow good and through evil  to death
   itself   but i am a citizen of the democratic republic of the
   united states  and in allegiance to it i have sworn to defend
   the constitution of my country  if need be  with my life 
   christ requires of me to do unto others as i would they should
   do unto me   the constitution of the united states requires of
   me to do unto two millions of slaves at that time there were
   slaves  now one might venture to substitute the word
   laborers the very opposite of what i would they should do
   unto methat is to help to keep them in their present
   condition of slavery   and  in spite of this  i continue to
   elect or be elected  i propose to vote  i am even ready to be
   appointed to any office under government   that will not hinder
   me from being a christian   i shall still profess christianity 
   and shall find no difficulty in carrying out my covenant
   with christ and with the government 

   jesus christ forbids me to resist evil doers  and to take from
   them an eye for an eye  a tooth for a tooth  bloodshed for
   bloodshed  and life for life 

   my government demands from me quite the opposite  and bases a
   system of selfdefense on gallows  musket  and sword  to be
   used against its foreign and domestic foes   and the land is
   filled accordingly with gibbets  prisons  arsenals  ships of
   war  and soldiers 

   in the maintenance and use of these expensive appliances for
   murder  we can very suitably exercise to the full the virtues
   of forgiveness to those who injure us  love toward our enemies 
   blessings to those who curse us  and doing good to those who
   hate us 

   for this we have a succession of christian priests to pray for
   us and beseech the blessing of heaven on the holy work of
   slaughter 

   i see all this i  e   the contradiction between profession and
   practice  and i continue to profess religion and take part in
   government  and pride myself on being at the same time a devout
   christian and a devoted servant of the government   i do not
   want to agree with these senseless notions of nonresistance 
   i cannot renounce my authority and leave only immoral men in
   control of the government   the constitution says the
   government has the right to declare war  and i assent to this
   and support it  and swear that i will support it   and i do not
   for that cease to be a christian  war  too  is a christian
   duty   is it not a christian duty to kill hundreds of thousands
   of ones fellowmen  to outrage women  to raze and burn towns 
   and to practice every possible cruelty   it is time to dismiss
   all these false sentimentalities   it is the truest means of
   forgiving injuries and loving enemies   if we only do it in the
   spirit of love  nothing can be more christian than such
   murder 

in another pamphlet  entitled how many men are necessary to
change a crime into a virtue  he says one man may not kill   if
he kills a fellowcreature  he is a murderer   if two  ten  a
hundred men do so  they  too  are murderers   but a government or
a nation may kill as many men as it chooses  and that will not be
murder  but a great and noble action   only gather the people
together on a large scale  and a battle of ten thousand men
becomes an innocent action   but precisely how many people must
there be to make it so that is the question   one man cannot
plunder and pillage  but a whole nation can   but precisely how
many are needed to make it permissible   why is it that one man 
ten  a hundred  may not break the law of god  but a great number
may 

and here is a version of ballous catechism composed for his
flock

   catechism of nonresistance 

     whence is the word nonresistance derived 

     from the command  resist not evil  m  v  39 

     what does this word express 

     it expresses a lofty christian virtue enjoined on us by
   christ 

     ought the word nonresistance to be taken in its widest
   sensethat is to say  as intending that we should not offer
   any resistance of any kind to evil 

     no  it ought to be taken in the exact sense of our saviours
   teachingthat is  not repaying evil for evil   we ought to
   oppose evil by every righteous means in our power  but not by
   evil 

     what is there to show that christ enjoined nonresistance in
   that sense 

     it is shown by the words he uttered at the same time   he
   said ye have heard  it was said of old  an eye for an eye 
   and a tooth for a tooth   but i say unto you resist not evil 
   but if one smites thee on the right cheek  turn him the other
   also  and if one will go to law with thee to take thy coat from
   thee  give him thy cloak also 

     of whom was he speaking in the words  ye have heard it was
   said of old 

     of the patriarchs and the prophets  contained in the old
   testament  which the hebrews ordinarily call the law and the
   prophets 

     what utterances did christ refer to in the words  it was
   said of old 

     the utterances of noah  moses  and the other prophets  in
   which they admit the right of doing bodily harm to those who
   inflict harm  so as to punish and prevent evil deeds 

     quote such utterances 

     whoso sheddeth mans blood  by man shall his blood be
   shed gen  ix  6 

   he that smiteth a man  so that he die  shall be surely put to
   death    and if any mischief follow  then thou shalt give life
   for life  eye for eye  tooth for tooth  hand for hand  foot for
   foot  burning for burning  wound for wound  stripe for stripe 
   ex  xxi  12 and 2325 

   he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death   and if
   a man cause a blemish in his neighbor  as he hath done  so
   shall it be done unto him breach for breach  eye for eye 
   tooth for tooth lev  xxiv  17  19  20 

   then the judges shall make diligent inquisition  and behold 
   if the witness be a false witness  and hath testified falsely
   against his brother  then shall ye do unto him as he had
   thought to have done unto his brother    and thine eye shall not
   pity  but life shall go for life  eye for eye  tooth for tooth 
   hand for hand  foot for foot deut  xix  18  21 

   noah  moses  and the prophets taught that he who kills  maims 
   or injures his neighbors does evil   to resist such evil  and
   to prevent it  the evil doer must be punished with death  or
   maiming  or some physical injury   wrong must be opposed by
   wrong  murder by murder  injury by injury  evil by evil   thus
   taught noah  moses  and the prophets   but christ rejects all
   this   i say unto you  is written in the gospel  resist not
   evil  do not oppose injury with injury  but rather bear
   repeated injury from the evil doer   what was permitted is
   forbidden   when we understand what kind of resistance they
   taught  we know exactly what resistance christ forbade 

     then the ancients allowed the resistance of injury by
   injury 

     yes  but jesus forbids it  the christian has in no case the
   right to put to death his neighbor who has done him evil  or to
   do him injury in return 

     may he kill or maim him in selfdefense 

     no 

     may he go with a complaint to the judge that he who has
   wronged him may be punished 

     no  what he does through others  he is in reality doing
   himself 

     can he fight in conflict with foreign enemies or disturbers
   of the peace 

     certainly not  he cannot take any part in war or in
   preparations for war   he cannot make use of a deadly weapon 
   he cannot oppose injury to injury  whether he is alone or with
   others  either in person or through other people 

     can he voluntarily vote or furnish soldiers for the
   government 

     he can do nothing of that kind if he wishes to be faithful
   to christs law 

     can he voluntarily give money to aid a government resting on
   military force  capital punishment  and violence in general 

     no  unless the money is destined for some special object 
   right in itself  and good both in aim and means 

     can he pay taxes to such a government 

     no  he ought not voluntarily to pay taxes  but he ought not
   to resist the collecting of taxes   a tax is levied by the
   government  and is exacted independently of the will of the
   subject   it is impossible to resist it without having recourse
   to violence of some kind   since the christian cannot employ
   violence  he is obliged to offer his property at once to the
   loss by violence inflicted on it by the authorities 

     can a christian give a vote at elections  or take part in
   government or law business 

     no  participation in election  government  or law business
   is participation in government by force 

     wherein lies the chief significance of the doctrine of
   nonresistance 

     in the fact that it alone allows of the possibility of
   eradicating evil from ones own heart  and also from ones
   neighbors   this doctrine forbids doing that whereby evil has
   endured for ages and multiplied in the world   he who attacks
   another and injures him  kindles in the other a feeling of
   hatred  the root of every evil   to injure another because he
   has injured us  even with the aim of overcoming evil  is
   doubling the harm for him and for oneself  it is begetting  or
   at least setting free and inciting  that evil spirit which we
   should wish to drive out   satan can never be driven out by
   satan   error can never be corrected by error  and evil cannot
   be vanquished by evil 

   true nonresistance is the only real resistance to evil   it is
   crushing the serpents head   it destroys and in the end
   extirpates the evil feeling 

     but if that is the true meaning of the rule of nonresistance 
   can it always put into practice 

     it can be put into practice like every virtue enjoined by
   the law of god   a virtue cannot be practiced in all
   circumstances without selfsacrifice  privation  suffering  and
   in extreme cases loss of life itself   but he who esteems life
   more than fulfilling the will of god is already dead to the
   only true life   trying to save his life he loses it   besides 
   generally speaking  where nonresistance costs the sacrifice of
   a single life or of some material welfare  resistance costs a
   thousand such sacrifices 

   nonresistance is salvation  resistance is ruin 

   it is incomparably less dangerous to act justly than unjustly 
   to submit to injuries than to resist them with violence  less
   dangerous even in ones relations to the present life   if all
   men refused to resist evil by evil our world would be happy 

     but so long as only a few act thus  what will happen to
   them 

     if only one man acted thus  and all the rest agreed
   to crucify him  would it not be nobler for him to die in the
   glory of nonresisting love  praying for his enemies  than to
   live to wear the crown of caesar stained with the blood of the
   slain   however  one man  or a thousand men  firmly resolved
   not to oppose evil by evil are far more free from danger by
   violence than those who resort to violence  whether among
   civilized or savage neighbors   the robber  the murderer  and
   the cheat will leave them in peace  sooner than those who
   oppose them with arms  and those who take up the sword shall
   perish by the sword  but those who seek after peace  and behave
   kindly and harmlessly  forgiving and forgetting injuries  for
   the most part enjoy peace  or  if they die  they die blessed 
   in this way  if all kept the ordinance of nonresistance  there
   would obviously be no evil nor crime   if the majority acted
   thus they would establish the rule of love and good will even
   over evil doers  never opposing evil with evil  and never
   resorting to force   if there were a moderately large minority
   of such men  they would exercise such a salutary moral
   influence on society that every cruel punishment would be
   abolished  and violence and feud would be replaced by peace and
   love   even if there were only a small minority of them  they
   would rarely experience anything worse than the worlds
   contempt  and meantime the world  though unconscious of it  and
   not grateful for it  would be continually becoming wiser and
   better for their unseen action on it   and if in the worst case
   some members of the minority were persecuted to death  in dying
   for the truth they would have left behind them their doctrine 
   sanctified by the blood of their martyrdom   peace  then  to
   all who seek peace  and may overruling love be the imperishable
   heritage of every soul who obeys willingly christs word 
   resist not evil 

   adin ballou 

for fifty years ballou wrote and published books dealing
principally with the question of nonresistance to evil by force 
in these works  which are distinguished by the clearness of their
thought and eloquence of exposition  the question is looked at
from every possible side  and the binding nature of this command
on every christian who acknowledges the bible as the revelation of
god is firmly established   all the ordinary objections to the
doctrine of nonresistance from the old and new testaments are
brought forward  such as the expulsion of the moneychangers from
the temple  and so on  and arguments follow in disproof of them
all   the practical reasonableness of this rule of conduct is
shown independently of scripture  and all the objections
ordinarily made against its practicability are stated and refuted 
thus one chapter in a book of his treats of nonresistance in
exceptional cases  and he owns in this connection that if there
were cases in which the rule of nonresistance were impossible of
application  it would prove that the law was not universally
authoritative   quoting these cases  he shows that it is precisely
in them that the application of the rule is both necessary and
reasonable   there is no aspect of the question  either on his
side or on his opponents  which he has not followed up in his
writings   i mention all this to show the unmistakable interest
which such works ought to have for men who make a profession of
christianity  and because one would have thought ballous work
would have been well known  and the ideas expressed by him would
lave been either accepted or refuted  but such has not been the
case 

the work of garrison  the father  in his foundation of the society
of nonresistants and his declaration  even more than my
correspondence with the quakers  convinced me of the fact that the
departure of the ruling form of christianity from the law of
christ on nonresistance by force is an error that has long been
observed and pointed out  and that men have labored  and are still
laboring  to correct   ballous work confirmed me still more in
this view   but the fate of garrison  still more that of ballou 
in being completely unrecognized in spite of fifty years of
obstinate and persistent work in the same direction  confirmed me
in the idea that there exists a kind of tacit but steadfast
conspiracy of silence about all such efforts 

ballou died in august  1890  and there was as obituary notice of him in
an american journal of christian views religiophilosophical journal 
august 23  in this laudatory notice it is recorded that ballou was the
spiritual director of a parish  that he delivered from eight to nine
thousand sermons  married one thousand couples  and wrote about five
hundred articles  but there is not a single word said of the object to
which he devoted his life  even the word nonresistance is not
mentioned  precisely as it was with all the preaching of the quakers for
two hundred years and  too  with the efforts of garrison the father  the
foundation of his society and journal  and his declaration  so it is
with the lifework of ballou  it seems just as though it did not exist
and never had existed 

we have an astounding example of the obscurity of works which aim
at expounding the doctrine of nonresistance to evil by force  and
at confuting those who do not recognize this commandment  in the
book of the tsech helchitsky  which has only lately been noticed
and has not hitherto been printed 

soon after the appearance of my book in german  i received a
letter from prague  from a professor of the university there 
informing me of the existence of a work  never yet printed  by
helchitsky  a tsech of the fifteenth century  entitled the net of
faith   in this work  the professor told me  helchitsky expressed
precisely the same view as to true and false christianity as i had
expressed in my book what i believe   the professor wrote to me
that helchitskys work was to be published for the first time in
the tsech language in the journal of the petersburg academy of
silence   since i could not obtain the book itself  i tried to
make myself acquainted with what was known of helchitsky  and i
gained the following information from a german book sent me by the
prague professor and from pypins history of tsech literature 
this was pypins account

   the net of faith is christs teaching  which ought to draw
   man up out of the dark depths of the sea of worldliness and his
   own iniquity   true faith consists in believing gods word  but
   now a time has come when men mistake the true faith for heresy 
   and therefore it is for the reason to point out what the true
   faith consists in  if anyone does not know this   it is hidden
   in darkness from men  and they do not recognize the true law of
   christ 

   to make this law plain  helchitsky points to the primitive
   organization of christian societythe organization which  he
   says  is now regarded in the roman church as an abominable
   heresy  this primitive church was his special ideal of social
   organization  founded on equality  liberty  and fraternity 
   christianity  in helchitskys view  still preserves these
   elements  and it is only necessary for society to return to its
   pure doctrine to render unnecessary every other form of social
   order in which kings and popes are essential  the law of love
   would alone be sufficient in every case 

   historically  helchitsky attributes the degeneration of
   christianity to the times of constantine the great  whom he
   pope sylvester admitted into the christian church with all his
   heathen morals and life   constantine  in his turn  endowed the
   pope with worldly riches and power   from that time forward
   these two ruling powers were constantly aiding one another to
   strive for nothing but outward glory   divines and
   ecclesiastical dignitaries began to concern themselves only
   about subduing the whole world to their authority  incited men
   against one another to murder and plunder  and in creed and
   life reduced christianity to a nullity  helchitsky denies
   completely the right to make war and to inflict the punishment
   of death  every soldier  even the knight  is only a violent
   evil doera murderer 

the same account is given by the german book  with the addition of
a few biographical details and some extracts from helchitskys
writings 

having learnt the drift of helchitskys teaching in this way  i
awaited all the more impatiently the appearance of the net of
faith in the journal of the academy   but one year passed  then
two and three  and still the book did not appear   it was only in 1888
that i learned that the printing of the book  which had been
begun  was stopped   i obtained the proofs of what had been
printed and read them through   it is a marvelous book from every
point of view 

its general tenor is given with perfect accuracy by pypin 
helchitskys fundamental idea is that christianity  by allying
itself with temporal power in the days of constantine  and by
continuing to develop in such conditions  has become completely
distorted  and has ceased to be christian altogether   helchitsky
gave the title the net of faith to his book  taking as his motto
the verse of the gospel about the calling of the disciples to be
fishers of men  and  developing this metaphor  he says

   christ  by means of his disciples  would have caught all the
   world in his net of faith  but the greater fishes broke the net
   and escaped out of it  and all the rest have slipped through
   the holes made by the greater fishes  so that the net has
   remained quite empty   the greater fishes who broke the net are
   the rulers  emperors  popes  kings  who have not renounced
   power  and instead of true christianity have put on what is
   simply a mask of it 

helchitsky teaches precisely what has been and is taught in these
days by the nonresistant mennonites and quakers  and in former
tunes by the bogomilites  paulicians  and many others   he teaches
that christianity  expecting from its adherents gentleness 
meekness  peaceableness  forgiveness of injuries  turning the
other cheek when one is struck  and love for enemies  is
inconsistent with the use of force  which is an indispensable
condition of authority 

the christian  according to helchitskys reasoning  not only
cannot be a ruler or a soldier  he cannot take any part in
government nor in trade  or even be a landowner  he can only be an
artisan or a husbandman 

this book is one of the few works attacking official christianity
which has escaped being burned   all such socalled heretical
works were burned at the stake  together with their authors  so
that there are few ancient works exposing the errors of official
christianity   the book has a special interest for this reason
alone   but apart from its interest from every point of view  it
is one of the most remarkable products of thought for its depth of
aim  for the astounding strength and beauty of the national
language in which it is written  and for its antiquity  and yet
for more than four centuries it has remained unprinted  and is
still unknown  except to a few learned specialists 

one would have thought that all such works  whether of the
quakers  of garrison  of ballou  or of helchitsky  asserting and
proving as they do  on the principles of the gospel  that our
modern world takes a false view of christs teaching  would have
awakened interest  excitement  talk  and discussion among
spiritual teachers and their flocks alike 

works of this kind  dealing with the very essence of christian
doctrine  ought  one would have thought  to have been examined and
accepted as true  or refuted and rejected   but nothing of the
kind has occurred  and the same fate has been repeated with all
those works   men of the most diverse views  believers  and  what
is surprising  unbelieving liberals also  as though by agreement 
all preserve the same persistent silence about them  and all that
has been done by people to explain the true meaning of christs
doctrine remains either ignored or forgotten 

but it is still more astonishing that two other books  of
which i heard on the appearance of my book  should be so little
known  i mean dymonds book on war  published for the first time
in london in 1824  and daniel mussers book on nonresistance 
written in 1864   it is particularly astonishing that these books
should be unknown  because  apart from their intrinsic merits 
both books treat not so much of the theory as of the practical
application of the theory to life  of the attitude of christianity
to military service  which is especially important and interesting
now in these clays of universal conscription 

people will ask  perhaps how ought a subject to behave who
believes that war is inconsistent with his religion while the
government demands from him that he should enter military service 

this question is  i think  a most vital one  and the answer to it
is specially important in these days of universal conscription 
allor at least the great majority of the peopleare christians 
and all men are called upon for military service   how ought a
man  as a christian  to meet this demand   this is the gist of
dymonds answer

   his duty is humbly but steadfastly to refuse to serve 

there are some people  who  without any definite reasoning about
it  conclude straightway that the responsibility of government
measures rests entirely on those who resolve on them  or that the
governments and sovereigns decide the question of what is good or
bad for their subjects  and the duty of the subjects is merely to
obey  i think that arguments of this kind only obscure mens
conscience   i cannot take part in the councils of government  and
therefore i am not responsible for its misdeeds    indeed  but we
are responsible for our own misdeeds   and the misdeeds of our
rulers become our own  if we  knowing that they are misdeeds 
assist in carrying  them out   those who suppose that they are
bound to obey the government  and that the responsibility for the
misdeeds they commit is transferred from them to their rulers 
deceive themselves   they say  we give our acts up to the will
of others  and our acts cannot be good or bad  there is no merit
in what is good nor responsibility for what is evil in our
actions  since they are not done of our own will 

it is remarkable that the very same thing is said in the
instructions to soldiers which they make them learnthat is  that
the officer is alone responsible for the consequences of his
command   but this is not right   a man cannot get rid of the
responsibility  for his own actions   and that is clear from the
following example   if your officer commands you to kill your
neighbors child  to kill your father or your mother  would you
obey   if you would not obey  the whole argument falls to the
ground  for if you can disobey the governors in one case  where do
you draw the line up to which you can obey them   there is no line
other than that laid down by christianity  and that line is both
reasonable and practicable 

and therefore we consider it the duty of every man who thinks war
inconsistent with christianity  meekly but firmly to refuse to
serve in the army   and let those whose lot it is to act thus 
remember that the fulfillment of a great duty rests with them 
the destiny of humanity in the world depends  so far as it depends
on men at all  on their fidelity to their religion   let them
confess their conviction  and stand up for it  and not in words
alone  but in sufferings too  if need be   if you believe that
christ forbade murder  pay no heed to the arguments nor to the
commands of those who call on you to bear a hand in it   by such a
steadfast refusal to make use of force  you call down on
yourselves the blessing promised to those who hear these sayings
and do them  and the time will come when the world will recognize
you as having aided in the reformation of mankind 

mussers book is called nonresistance asserted  or kingdom of
christ and kingdoms of this world separated   this book is
devoted to the same question  and was written when the american
government was exacting military service from its citizens at the
time of the civil war   and it has  too  a value for all time 
dealing with the question how  in such circumstances  people
should and can refuse to enter military service  here is the tenor
of the authors introductory remarks

   it is well known that there are many persons in the united
   states who refuse to fight on grounds of conscience   they are
   called the defenseless  or nonresistant christians   these
   christians refuse to defend their country  to bear arms  or at
   the call of government to make war on its enemies   till lately
   this religious scruple seemed a valid excuse to the government 
   and those who urged it were let off service   but at the
   beginning of our civil war public opinion was agitated on this
   subject   it was natural that persons who considered it their
   duty to bear all the hardships and dangers of war in defense of
   their country should feel resentment against those persons who
   had for long shared with them the advantages of the protection
   of government  and who now in time of need and danger would not
   share in bearing the labors and dangers of its defense   it was
   even natural that they should declare the attitude of such men
   monstrous  irrational  and suspicious 

a host of orators and writers  our author tells us  arose to oppose this
attitude  and tried to prove the sinfulness of nonresistance  both from
scripture and on commonsense grounds  and this was perfectly natural 
and in many cases the authors were rightright  that is  in regard to
persons who did not renounce the benefits they received from the
government and tried to avoid the hardships of military service  but not
right in regard to the principle of nonresistance itself  above all 
our author proves the binding nature of the rule of nonresistance for a
christian  pointing out that this command is perfectly clear  and is
enjoined upon every christian by christ without possibility of
misinterpretation  bethink yourselves whether it is righteous to obey
man more than god  said peter and john  and this is precisely what
ought to be the attitude to every man who wishes to be christian to the
claim on him for military service  when christ has said  resist not
evil by force  as for the question of the principle itself  the author
regards that as decided  as to the second question  whether people have
the right to refuse to serve in the army who have not refused the
benefits conferred by a government resting on force  the author
considers it in detail  and arrives at the conclusion that a christian
following the law of christ  since he does not go to war  ought not
either to take advantage of any institutions of government  courts of
law  or elections  and that in his private concerns he must not have
recourse to the authorities  the police  or the law  further on in the
book he treats of the relation of the old testament to the new  the
value of government for those who are christians  and makes some
observations on the doctrine of nonresistance and the attacks made on
it  the author concludes his book by saying christians do not need
government  and therefore they cannot either obey it in what is contrary
to christs teaching nor  still less  take part in it  christ took his
disciples out of the world  he says  they do not expect worldly
blessings and worldly happiness  but they expect eternal life  the
spirit in whom they live makes them contented and happy in every
position  if the world tolerates them  they are always happy  if the
world will not leave them in peace  they will go elsewhere  since they
are pilgrims on the earth and they have no fixed place of habitation 
they believe that the dead may bury their dead  one thing only is
needful for them  to follow their master 

even putting aside the question as to the principle laid down in these
two books as to the christians duty in his attitude to war  one cannot
help perceiving the practical importance and the urgent need of deciding
the question 

there are people  hundreds of thousands of quakers  mennonites 
all our douhobortsi  molokani  and others who do not belong to any
definite sect  who consider that the use of forceand 
consequently  military serviceis inconsistent with christianity 
consequently there are every year among us in russia some men
called upon for military service who refuse to serve on the ground
of their religious convictions   does the government let them off
then   no   does it compel them to go  and in case of disobedience
punish them   no  this was how the government treated them in
1818   here is an extract from the diary of nicholas myravyov of
kars  which was not passed by the censor  and is not known in
russia

   tiflis  october 2  1818 

   in the morning the commandant told me that five peasants
   belonging to a landowner in the tamboff government had lately
   been sent to georgi   these men had been sent for soldiers 
   but they would not serve  they had been several times flogged
   and made to run the gauntlet  but they would submit readily to
   the cruelest tortures  and even to death  rather than serve 
   let us go  they said  and leave us alone  we will not hurt
   anyone  all men are equal  and the tzar is a man like us  why
   should we pay him tribute  why should i expose my life to
   danger to kill in battle some man who has done me no harm   you
   can cut us to pieces and we will not be soldiers   he who has
   compassion on us will give us charity  but as for the
   government rations  we have not had them and we do not want to
   have them   these were the words of those peasants  who declare
   that there are numbers like them russi   they brought them
   four times before the committee of ministers  and at last
   decided to lay the matter before the tzar who gave orders that
   they should be taken to georgia for correction  and commanded
   the commanderinchief to send him a report every month of
   their gradual success in bringing these peasants to a better
   mind 

how the correction ended is not known  as the whole episode indeed
was unknown  having been kept in profound secrecy 

this was how the government behaved seventyfive years agothis
is how it has behaved in a great cumber of cases  studiously
concealed from the people   and this is how the government behaves
now  except in the case of the german mennonites  living in the
province of kherson  whose plea against military service is
considered well grounded   they are made to work off their term of
service in labor in the forests 

but in the recent cases of refusal on the part of mennonites to
serve in the army on religious grounds  the government authorities
have acted in the following manner

to begin with  they have recourse to every means of coercion used
in our times to correct the culprit and bring him to a better
mind  and these measures are carried out with the greatest
secrecy   i know that in the case of one man who declined to serve
in 1884 in moscow  the official correspondence on the subject had
two months after his refusal accumulated into a big folio  and was
kept absolutely secret among the ministry 

they usually begin by sending the culprit to the priests  and the
latter  to their shame be it said  always exhort him to obedience 
but since the exhortation in christs name to forswear christ is
for the most part unsuccessful  after he has received the
admonitions of the spiritual authorities  they send him to the
gendarmes  and the latter  finding  as a rule  no political cause
for offense in him  dispatch him back again  and then he is sent
to the learned men  to the doctors  and to the madhouse   during
all these vicissitudes he is deprived of liberty and has to endure
every kind of humiliation and suffering as a convicted criminal 
all this has been repeated in four cases   the doctors let him
out of the madhouse  and then every kind of secret shift is
employed to prevent him from going freewhereby others would be
encouraged to refuse to serve as he has doneand at the same time
to avoid leaving him among the soldiers  for fear they too should
learn from him that military service is not at all their duty by
the law of god  as they are assured  but quite contrary to it 

the most convenient thing for the government would be to kill the
nonresistant by flogging him to death or some other means  as was
done in former days   but to put a man openly to death because he
believes in the creed we all confess is impossible   to let a man
alone who has refused obedience is also impossible   and so the
government tries either to compel the man by illtreatment to
renounce christ  or in some way or other to get rid of him
unobserved  without openly putting him to death  and to hide
somehow both the action and the man himself from other people 
and so all kinds of shifts and wiles and cruelties are set on foot
against him   they either send him to the frontier or provoke him
to insubordination  and then try him for breach of discipline and
shut him up in the prison of the disciplinary battalion  where
they can ill treat him freely unseen by anyone  or they declare
him mad  and lock him up in a lunatic asylum   they sent one man
in this way to tashkendthat is  they pretended to transfer to
the tashkend army  another to omsk  a third him they convicted of
insubordination and shut up in prison  a fourth they sent to a
lunatic asylum 

everywhere the same story is repeated   not only the government 
but the great majority of liberal  advanced people  as they are
called  studiously turn away from everything that has been said 
written  or done  or is being done by men to prove the
incompatibility of force in its most awful  gross  and glaring
formin the form  that is  of an army of soldiers prepared to
murder anyone  whoever it may bewith the teachings of
christianity  or even of the humanity which society professes as
its creed 

so that the information i have gained of the attitude of the
higher ruling classes  not only in russia but in europe and
america  toward the elucidation of this question has convinced me
that there exists in these ruling classes a consciously hostile
attitude to true christianity  which is shown preeminently in
their reticence in regard to all manifestations of it 




chapter ii 

criticisms of the doctrine of nonresistance to evil by force on
the part of believers and of unbelievers 

fate of the book what i believe evasive character of religious
criticisms of principles of my book 1st reply use of force
not opposed to christianity 2d reply use of force necessary
to restrain evil doers 3d reply duty of using force in
defense of ones neighbor 4th reply the breach of the command
of nonresistance to be regarded simply as a weakness 5th
reply reply evaded by making believe that the question has
long been decided to devise such subterfuges and to take
refuge behind the authority of the church  of antiquity  and of
religion is all that ecclesiastical critics can do to get out
of the contradiction between use of force and christianity in
theory and in practice general attitude of the ecclesiastical
world and of the authorities to profession of true
christianity general character of russian freethinking
critics foreign freethinking critics mistaken arguments of
these critics the result of misunderstanding the true meaning
of christs teaching 


the impression i gained of a desire to conceal  to hush up  what i
had tried to express in my book  led me to judge the book itself
afresh 

on its appearance it had  as i had anticipated  been forbidden 
and ought therefore by law to have been burnt   but  at the same
time  it was discussed among officials  and circulated in a great
number of manuscript and lithograph copies  and in translations
printed abroad 

and very quickly after the book  criticisms  both religious and
secular in character  made their appearance  and these the
government tolerated  and even encouraged   so that the refutation
of a book which no one was supposed to know anything about was
even chosen as the subject for theological dissertations in the
academies 

the criticisms of my book  russian and foreign alike  fall under
two general divisionsthe religious criticisms of men who regard
themselves as believers  and secular criticisms  that is  those of
freethinkers 

i will begin with the first class   in my book i made it an
accusation against the teachers of the church that their teaching
is opposed to christs commands clearly and definitely expressed
in the sermon on the mount  and opposed in especial to his command
in regard to resistance to evil  and that in this way they deprive
christs teaching of all value   the church authorities accept the
teaching of the sermon on the mount on nonresistance to evil by
force as divine revelation  and therefore one would have thought
that if they felt called upon to write about my book at all  they
would have found it inevitable before everything else to reply to
the principal point of my charge against them  and to say plainly 
do they or do they not admit the teaching of the sermon on the
mount and the commandment of nonresistance to evil as binding on
a christian   and they were bound to answer this question  not
after the usual fashion i  e   that although on the one side one
cannot absolutely deny  yet on the other side one cannot main
fully assent  all the more seeing that  etc   etc    no  they
should have answered the question as plainly as it was put
in my bookdid christ really demand from his disciples
that they should carry out what he taught them in the sermon on
the mount   and can a christian  then  or can he not  always
remaining a christian  go to law or make any use of the law  or
seek his own protection in the law   and can the christian  or can
he not  remaining a christian  take part in the administration of
government  using compulsion against his neighbors   andthe most
important question hanging over the heads of all of us in these
days of universal military servicecan the christian  or can he
not  remaining a christian  against christs direct prohibition 
promise obedience in future actions directly opposed to his
teaching   and can he  by taking his share of service in the army 
prepare himself to murder men  and even actually murder them 

these questions were put plainly and directly  and seemed to
require a plain and direct answer  but in all the criticisms of my
book there was no such plain and direct answer   no  my book
received precisely the same treatment as all the attacks upon the
teachers of the church for their defection from the law of christ
of which history from the days of constantine is full 

a very great deal was said in connection with my book of my having
incorrectly interpreted this and other passages of the gospel  of
my being in error in not recognizing the trinity  the redemption 
and the immortality of the soul   a very great deal was said  but
not a word about the one thing which for every christian is the
most essential question in lifehow to reconcile the duty of
forgiveness  meekness  patience  and love for all  neighbors and
enemies alike  which is so clearly expressed in the words of our
teacher  and in the heart of each of ushow to reconcile this
duty with the obligation of using force in war upon men of our own
or a foreign people 

all that are worth calling answers to this question can be brought
under the following five heads   i have tried to bring together in
this connection all i could  not only from the criticisms on my
book  but from what has been written in past times on this theme 

the first and crudest form of reply consists in the bold assertion
that the use of force is not opposed by the teaching of christ 
that it is permitted  and even enjoined  on the christian by the
old and new testaments 

assertions of this kind proceed  for the most part  from men who
have attained the highest ranks in the governing or ecclesiastical
hierarchy  and who are consequently perfectly assured that no one
will dare to contradict their assertion  and that if anyone does
contradict it they will hear nothing of the contradiction   these
men have  for the most part  through the intoxication of power  so
lost the right idea of what that christianity is in the name of
which they hold their position that what is christian in
christianity presents itself to them as heresy  while everything
in the old and new testaments which can be distorted into an
antichristian and heathen meaning they regard as the foundation of
christianity   in support of their assertion that christianity is
not opposed to the use of force  these men usually  with the
greatest audacity  bring together all the most obscure passages
from the old and new testaments  interpreting them in the most
unchristian waythe punishment of ananias and sapphira  of simon
the sorcerer  etc   they quote all those sayings of christs which
can possibly be interpreted as justification of cruelty the
expulsion from the temple  it shall be more tolerable for the
land of sodom than for this city  etc   etc   according to these
peoples notions  a christian government is not in the least bound
to be guided by the spirit of peace  forgiveness of injuries  and
love for enemies 

to refute such an assertion is useless  because the very
people who make this assertion refute themselves  or  rather 
renounce christ  inventing a christianity and a christ of their
own in the place of him in whose name the church itself exists  as
well as their office in it   if all men were to learn that the
church professes to believe in a christ of punishment and warfare 
not of forgiveness  no one would believe in the church and it
could not prove to anyone what it is trying to prove 

the second  somewhat less gross  form of argument consists in
declaring that  though christ did indeed preach that we should
turn the left cheek  and give the cloak also  and this is the
highest moral duty  yet that there are wicked men in the world 
and if these wicked men mere not restrained by force  the whole
world and all good men would come to ruin through them   this
argument i found for the first time in john chrysostom  and i show
how he is mistaken in my book what i believe 

this argument is ill grounded  because if we allow ourselves to
regard any men as intrinsically wicked men  then in the first
place we annul  by so doing  the whole idea of the christian
teaching  according to which we are all equals and brothers  as
sons of one father in heaven   secondly  it is ill founded 
because even if to use force against wicked men had been permitted
by god  since it is impossible to find a perfect and unfailing
distinction by which one could positively know the wicked from the
good  so it would come to all individual men and societies of men
mutually regarding each other as wicked men  as is the case now 
thirdly  even if it were possible to distinguish the wicked from
the good unfailingly  even then it would be impossible to kill or
injure or shut up in prison these wicked men  because there would
be no one in a christian society to carry out such punishment 
since every christian  as a christian  has been commanded to use
no force against the wicked 

the third kind of answer  still more subtle than the preceding 
consists in asserting that though the command of nonresistance to
evil by force is binding on the christian when the evil is
directed against himself personally  it ceases to be binding when
the evil is directed against his neighbors  and that then the
christian is not only not bound to fulfill the commandment  but is
even bound to act in opposition to it in defense of his neighbors 
and to use force against transgressors by force   this assertion
is an absolute assumption  and one cannot find in all christs
teaching any confirmation of such an argument   such an argument
is not only a limitation  but a direct contradiction and negation
of the commandment   if every man has the right to have recourse
to force in face of a danger threatening an other  the question of
the use of force is reduced to a question of the definition of
danger for another   if my private judgment is to decide the
question of what is danger for another  there is no occasion for
the use of force which could not be justified on the ground of
danger threatening some other man   they killed and burnt witches 
they killed aristocrats and girondists  they killed their enemies
because those who were in authority regarded them as dangerous for
the people 

if this important limitation  which fundamentally undermines the
whole value of the commandment  had entered into christs meaning 
there must have been mention of it somewhere   this restriction is
made nowhere in our saviours life or preaching   on the contrary 
warning is given precisely against this treacherous and scandalous
restriction which nullifies the commandment   the error and
impossibility of such a limitation is shown in the gospel with
special clearness in the account of the judgment of caiaphas  who
makes precisely this distinction   he acknowledged that it was
wrong to punish the innocent jesus  but he saw in him a source of
danger not for himself  but for the whole people  and therefore he
said it is better for one man to die  that the whole people
perish not   and the erroneousness of such a limitation is still
more clearly expressed in the words spoken to peter when he tried
to resist by force evil directed against jesus matt  xxvi  52 
peter was not defending himself  but his beloved and heavenly
master   and christ at once reproved him for this  saying  that he
who takes up the sword shall perish by the sword 

besides  apologies for violence used against ones neighbor in defense
of another neighbor from greater violence are always untrustworthy 
because when force is used against one who has not yet carried out his
evil intent  i can never know which would be greaterthe evil of my act
of violence or of the act i want to prevent  we kill the criminal that
society may be rid of him  and we never know whether the criminal of
today would not have been a changed man tomorrow  and whether our
punishment of him is not useless cruelty  we shut up the dangerousas
we thinkmember of society  but the next day this man might cease to be
dangerous and his imprisonment might be for nothing  i see that a man i
know to be a ruffian is pursuing a young girl  i have a gun in my
handi kill the ruffian and save the girl  but the death or the
wounding of the ruffian has positively taken place  while what would
have happened if this had not been i cannot know  and what an immense
mass of evil must result  and indeed does result  from allowing men to
assume the right of anticipating what may happen  ninetynine per cent
of the evil of the world is founded on this reasoningfrom the
inquisition to dynamite bombs  and the executions or punishments of tens
of thousands of political criminals 

a fourth  still more refined  reply to the question  what ought to
be the christians attitude to christs command of nonresistance
to evil by force  consists in declaring that they do not deny the
command of nonresisting evil  but recognize it  but they only do
not ascribe to this command the special exclusive value attached
to it by sectarians   to regard this command as the indispensable
condition of christian life  as garrison  ballou  dymond  the
quakers  the mennonites and the shakers do now  and as the
moravian brothers  the waldenses  the albigenses  the bogomilites 
and the paulicians did in the past  is a onesided heresy   this
command has neither more nor less value than all the other
commands  and the man who through weakness transgresses any
command whatever  the command of nonresistance included  does not
cease to be a christian if he hold the true faith   this is a very
skillful device  and many people who wish to be deceived are
easily deceived by it   the device consists in reducing a direct
conscious denial of a command to a casual breach of it   but one
need only compare the attitude of the teachers of the church to
this and to other commands which they really do recognize  to be
convinced that their attitude to this is completely different from
their attitude to other duties 

the command against fornication they do really recognize  and
consequently they do not admit that in any case fornication can
cease to be wrong   the church preachers never point out cases in
which the command against fornication can be broken  and always
teach that we must avoid seductions which lead to temptation to
fornication   but not so with the command of nonresistance   all
church preachers recognize cases in which that command can be
broken  and teach the people accordingly   and they not only do
not teach teat we should avoid temptations to break it  chief of
which is the military oath  but they themselves administer it 
the preachers of the church never in any other case advocate the
breaking of any other commandment   but in connection with the
commandment of nonresistance they openly teach that we must not
understand it too literally  but that there are conditions and
circumstances in which we must do the direct opposite  that is  go
to law  fight  punish   so that occasions for fulfilling the
commandment of nonresistance to evil by force are taught for the
most part as occasions for not fulfilling it   the fulfillment of
this command  they say  is very difficult and pertains only to
perfection   and how can it not be difficult  when the breach of
it is not only not forbidden  but law courts  prisons  cannons 
guns  armies  and wars are under the immediate sanction of the
church   it cannot be true  then  that this command is recognized
by the preachers of the church as on a level with other commands 

the preachers of the church clearly  do not recognize it  only not
daring to acknowledge this  they try to conceal their not
recognizing it 

so much for the fourth reply 

the fifth kind of answer  which is the subtlest  the most often
used  and the most effective  consists in avoiding answering  in
making believe that this question is one which has long ago been
decided perfectly clearly and satisfactorily  and that it is not
worth while to talk about it   this method of reply is employed by
all the more or less cultivated religious writers  that is to say 
those who feel the laws of christ binding for themselves   knowing
that the contradiction existing between the teaching of christ
which we profess with our lips and the whole order of our lives
cannot be removed by words  and that touching upon it can only
make it more obvious  they  with more or less ingenuity  evade it 
pretending that the question of reconciling christianity with the
use of force has been decided already  or does not exist at all 

    footnote i only know one work which differs somewhat from
    this general definition  and that is not a criticism in the
    precise meaning of the word  but an article treating of the
    same subject and having my book in view   i mean the pamphlet
    of mr  troizky published at kazan  a sermon for the
    people   the author obviously accepts christs teaching in
    its true meaning   he says that the prohibition of resistance
    to evil by force means exactly what it does mean  and the same
    with the prohibition of swearing   he does not  as others do 
    deny the meaning of christs teaching  but unfortunately he
    does not draw from this admission the inevitable deductions
    which present themselves spontaneously in our life when we
    understand christs teaching in that way   if we must not
    oppose evil by force  nor swear  everyone naturally asks 
    how  then  about military service  and the oath of
    obedience   to this question the author gives no reply  but
    it must be answered   and if he cannot answer  then he would
    do better no to speak on the subject at all  as such silence
    leads to error 

the majority of religious critics of my book use this fifth method
of replying to it  i could quote dozens of such critics  in all of
whom  without exception  we find the same thing repeated
everything is discussed except what constitutes the principal
subject of the book   as a characteristic example of such
criticisms  i will quote the article of a wellknown and ingenious
english writer and preacherfarrarwho  like many learned
theologians  is a great master of the art of circuitously evading
a question   the article was published in an american journal  the
forum  in october  1888 

after conscientiously explaining in brief the contents of my book 
farrar says

   tolstoy came to the conclusion that a coarse deceit had been
   palmed upon the world when these words resist not evil  were
   held by civil society to be compatible with war  courts of
   justice  capital punishment  divorce  oaths  national
   prejudice  and  indeed  with most of the institutions of civil
   and social life   he now believes that the kingdom of god would
   come if all men kept these five commandments of christ  viz 
   1  live in peace with all men   2  be pure   3  take no oaths 
   4  resist not evil   5  renounce national distinctions 

   tolstoy  he says  rejects the inspiration of the old
   testament  hence he rejects the chief doctrines of the churchthat
   of the atonement by blood  the trinity  the descent of the
   holy ghost on the apostles  and his transmission through the
   priesthood   and he recognizes only the words and commands of
   christ   but is this interpretation of christ a true one  he
   says   are all men bound to act as tolstoy teachesi  e   to
   carry out these five commandments of christ 

you expect  then  that in answer to this essential question  which
is the only one that could induce a man to write an article about
the book  he will say either that this interpretation of christs
teaching is true and we ought to follow it  or he will say that
such an interpretation is untrue  will show why  and will give
some other correct interpretation of those words which i interpret
incorrectly   but nothing of this kind is done   farrar only
expresses his belief that 

   although actuated by the noblest sincerity  count tolstoy has
   been misled by partial and onesided interpretations of the
   meaning of the gospel and the mind and will of christ   what
   this error consists in is not made clear  it is only said
   to enter into the proof of this is impossible in this article 
   for i have already exceeded the space at my command 

and he concludes in a tranquil spirit

   meanwhile  the reader who feels troubled lest it should be his
   duty also to forsake all the conditions of his life and to take
   up the position and work of a common laborer  may rest for the
   present on the principle  securus judicat orbis terrarum   with
   few and rare exceptions  he continues  the whole of
   christendom  from the days of the apostles down to our own  has
   come to the firm conclusion that it was the object of christ to
   lay down great eternal principles  but not to disturb the bases
   and revolutionize the institutions of all human society  which
   themselves rest on divine sanctions as well as on inevitable
   conditions   were it my object to prove how untenable is the
   doctrine of communism  based by count tolstoy upon the divine
   paradoxes sic  which can be interpreted only on historical
   principles in accordance with the whole method of the teaching
   of jesus  it would require an ampler canvas than i have here at
   my disposal 

what a pity he has not an ampler canvas at his disposal  and what a
strange thing it is that for all these last fifteen centuries no one has
had a canvas ample enough to prove that christ  whom we profess to
believe in  says something utterly unlike what he does say  still  they
could prove it if they wanted to  but it is not worth while to prove
what everyone knows  it is enough to say securus judicat orbis
terrarum 

and of this kind  without exception  are all the criticisms of educated
believers  who must  as such  understand the danger of their position 
the sole escape from it for them lies in their hope that they may be
able  by using the authority of the church  of antiquity  and of their
sacred office  to overawe the reader and draw him away from the idea of
reading the gospel for himself and thinking out the question in his own
mind for himself  and in this they are successful  for  indeed  how
could the notion occur to any one that all that has been repeated from
century to century with such earnestness and solemnity by all those
archdeacons  bishops  archbishops  holy synods  and popes  is all of it
a base lie and a calumny foisted upon christ by them for the sake of
keeping safe the money they must have to live luxuriously on the necks
of other men  and it is a lie and a calumny so transparent that the only
way of keeping it up consists in overawing people by their earnestness 
their conscientiousness  it is just what has taken place of late years
at recruiting sessions  at a table before the zertzalthe symbol of the
tzars authorityin the seat of honor under the lifesize portrait of
the tzar  sit dignified old officials  wearing decorations  conversing
freely and easily  writing notes  summoning men before them  and giving
orders  here  wearing a cross on his breast  near them  is
prosperouslooking old priest in a silken cassock  with long gray hair
flowing on to his cope  before a lectern who wears the golden cross and
has a gospel bound in gold 

they summon iran petroff   a young man comes in  wretchedly 
shabbily dressed  and in terror  the muscles of his face working 
his eyes bright and restless  and in a broken voice  hardly above
a whisper  he says iby christs lawas a christiani
cannot   what is he muttering  asks the president  frowning
impatiently and raising his eyes from his book to listen  speak
louder  the colonel with shining epaulets shouts to him  ii as
a christian  and at last it appears that the young man refuses
to serve in the army because he is a christian   dont talk
nonsense   stand to be measured   doctor  may i trouble you to
measure him   he is all right   yes   reverend father 
administer the oath to him 

no one is the least disturbed by what the poor scared young man is
muttering  they do not even pay attention to it   they all mutter
something  but weve no time to listen to it  we have to enroll so
many 

the recruit tries to say something still   its opposed to the
law of christ   go along  go along  we know without your help
what is opposed to the law and whats not  and you soothe his
mind  reverend father  soothe him   next vassily nikitin   and
they lead the trembling youth away  and it does not strike anyone
the guards  or vassily nikitin  whom they are bringing in  or
any of the spectators of this scenethat these inarticulate words
of the young man  at once suppressed by the authorities  contain
the truth  and that the loud  solemnly uttered sentences of the
calm  selfconfident official and the priest are a lie and a
deception 

such is the impression produced not only by farrars article  but
by all those solemn sermons  articles  and books which make their
appearance from all sides directly there is anywhere a glimpse of
truth exposing a predominant falsehood   at once begins the series
of long  clever  ingenious  and solemn speeches and writings 
which deal with questions nearly related to the subject  but
skillfully avoid touching the subject itself 

that is the essence of the fifth and most effective means of
getting out of the contradictions in which church christianity has
placed itself  by professing its faith in christs teaching in
words  while it denies it in its life  and teaches
people to do the same 

those who justify themselves by the first method  directly 
crudely asserting that christ sanctioned violence  wars  and
murder  repudiate christs doctrine directly  those who find their
defense in the second  the third  or the fourth method are
confused and can easily be convicted of error  but this last
class  who do not argue  who do not condescend to argue about it 
but take shelter behind their own grandeur  and make a show of all
this having been decided by them or at least by someone long ago 
and no longer offering a possibility of doubt to anyonethey seem
safe from attack  and will be beyond attack till men come to
realize that they are under the narcotic influence exerted on them
by governments and churches  and are no longer affected by it 

such was the attitude of the spiritual criticsi  e   those
professing faith in christto my book   and their attitude could
not have been different   they are bound to take up this attitude
by the contradictory position in which they find themselves
between belief in the divinity of their master and disbelief in
his clearest utterances  and they want to escape from this
contradiction   so that one cannot expect from them free
discussion of the very essence of the questionthat is  of the
change in mens life which must result from applying christs
teaching to the existing order of the world   such free discussion
i only expected from worldly  freethinking critics who are not
bound to christs teaching in any way  and can therefore take an
independent view of it   i had anticipated that freethinking
writers would look at christ  not merely  like the churchmen  as
the founder of a religion of personal salvation  but  to express
it in their language  as a reformer who laid down new principles
of life and destroyed the old  and whose reforms are not yet
complete  but are still in progress even now 

such a view of christ and his teaching follows from my book  but to my
astonishment  out of the great number of critics of my book there was
not one  either russian or foreign  who treated the subject from the
side from which it was approached in the bookthat is  who criticised
christs doctrines as philosophical  moral  and social principles  to
use their scientific expressions  this was not done in a single
criticism  the freethinking russian critics taking my book as though its
whole contents could be reduced to nonresistance to evil  and
understanding the doctrine of nonresistance to evil itself no doubt
for greater convenience in refuting it as though it would prohibit
every kind of conflict with evil  fell vehemently upon this doctrine 
and for some years past have been very successfully proving that
christs teaching is mistaken in so far as it forbids resistance to
evil  their refutations of this hypothetical doctrine of christ were all
the more successful since they knew beforehand that their arguments
could not be contested or corrected  for the censorship  not having
passed the book  did not pass articles in its defense 

it is a remarkable thing that among us  where one cannot say a
word about the holy scriptures without the prohibition of the
censorship  for some years past there have been in all the
journals constant attacks and criticisms on the command of christ
simply and directly stated in matt  v  39   the russian advanced
critics  obviously unaware of all that has been done to elucidate
the question of nonresistance  and sometimes even imagining
apparently that the rule of nonresistance to evil had been
invented by me personally  fell foul of the very idea of it   they
opposed it and attacked it  and advancing with great heat
arguments which had long ago been analyzed and refuted from every
point of view  they demonstrated that a man ought invariably to
defend with violence all the injured and oppressed  and that
thus the doctrine of nonresistance to evil is an immoral
doctrine 

to all russian critics the whole import of christs command seemed
reducible to the fact that it would hinder them from the active
opposition to evil to which they are accustomed   so that the
principle of nonresistance to evil by force has been attacked by
two opposing camps the conservatives  because this principle
would hinder their activity in resistance to evil as applied to
the revolutionists  in persecution and punishment of them  the
revolutionists  too  because this principle would hinder their
resistance to evil as applied to the conservatives and the
overthrowing of them   the conservatives were indignant at the
doctrine of nonresistance to evil by force hindering the
energetic destruction of the revolutionary elements  which may
ruin the national prosperity  the revolutionists were indignant at
the doctrine of nonresistance to evil by force hindering the
overthrow of the conservatives  who are ruining the national
prosperity   it is worthy of remark in this connection that the
revolutionists have attacked the principle of nonresistance to
evil by force  in spite of the fact that it is the greatest terror
and danger for every despotism   for ever since the beginning of
the world  the use of violence of every kind  from the inquisition
to the schl√ºsselburg fortress  has rested and still rests on the
opposite principle of the necessity of resisting evil by force 

besides this  the russian critics have pointed out the fact that
the application of the command of nonresistance to practical life
would turn mankind aside out of the path of civilization along
which it is moving   the path of civilization on which mankind in
europe is moving is in their opinion the one along which all
mankind ought always to move 

so much for the general character of the russian critics 

foreign critics started from the same premises  but their
discussions of my book were somewhat different from those of
russian critics  not only in being less bitter  and in showing
more culture  but even in the subjectmatter 

in discussing my book and the gospel teaching generally  as it is
expressed in the sermon on the mount  the foreign critics
maintained that such doctrine is not peculiarly christian
christian doctrine is either catholicism or protestantism
according to their viewsthe teaching of the sermon on the mount
is only a string of very pretty impracticable dreams du charmant
docteur  as reran says  fit for the simple and halfsavage
inhabitants of galilee who lived eighteen hundred years ago  and
for the halfsavage russian peasantssutaev and bondarevand the
russian mystic tolstoy  but not at all consistent with a high
degree of european culture 

the foreign freethinking critics have tried in a delicate manner 
without being offensive to me  to give the impression that my
conviction that mankind could be guided by such a na√Øve doctrine
as that of the sermon on the mount proceeds from two causes that
such a conviction is partly due to my want of knowledge  my
ignorance of history  my ignorance of all the vain attempts to
apply the principles of the sermon on the mount to life  which
have been made in history and have led to nothing  and partly it
is due to my failing to appreciate the full value of the lofty
civilization to which mankind has attained at present  with its
krupp cannons  smokeless powder  colonization of africa  irish
coercion bill  parliamentary government  journalism  strikes  and
the eiffel tower 

so wrote de vog√º√© and leroy beaulieu and matthew arnold  so wrote
the american author savage  and ingersoll  the popular
freethinking american preacher  and many others 

christs teaching is no use  because it is inconsistent with our
industrial age  says ingersoll na√Øvely  expressing in this
utterance  with perfect directness and simplicity  the exact
notion of christs teaching held by persons of refinement and
culture of our times   the teaching is no use for our industrial
age  precisely as though the existence of this industrial age were
a sacred fact which ought not to and could not be changed   it is
just as though drunkards when advised how they could be brought to
habits of sobriety should answer that the advice is incompatible
with their habit of taking alcohol 

the arguments of all the freethinking critics  russian and foreign
alike  different as they may be in tone and manner of
presentation  all amount essentially to the same strange
misapprehensionnamely  that christs teaching  one of the
consequences of which is nonresistance to evil  is of no use to
us because it requires a change of our life 

christs teaching is useless because  if it were carried into practice 
life could not go on as at present  we must add if we have begun by
living sinfully  as we do live and are accustomed to live  not only is
the question of nonresistance to evil not discussed  the very mention
of the fact that the duty of nonresistance enters into christs
teaching is regarded as satisfactory proof of the impracticability of
the whole teaching 

meanwhile one would have thought it was necessary to point out at
least some kind of solution of the following question  since it is
at the root of almost everything that interests us 

the question amounts to this in what way are we to decide mens
disputes  when some men consider evil what others consider good 
and vice versa   and to reply that that is evil which i think
evil  in spite of the fact that my opponent thinks it good  is not
a solution of the difficulty   there can only be two solutions
either to find a real unquestionable criterion of what is evil or
not to resist evil by force 

the first course has been tried ever since the beginning of
historical times  and  as we all know  it has not hitherto led to
any successful results 

the second solutionnot forcibly to resist what we consider evil
until we have found a universal criterionthat is the solution
given by christ 

we may consider the answer given by christ unsatisfactory  we may
replace it by another and better  by finding a criterion by which
evil could be defined for all men unanimously and simultaneously 
we may simply  like savage nations  not recognize the existence of
the question   but we cannot treat the question as the learned
critics of christianity do   they pretend either that no such
question exists at all or that the question is solved by granting
to certain persons or assemblies of persons the right to define
evil and to resist it by force   but we know all the while that
granting such a right to certain persons does not decide the
question still less so when we are ourselves the certain
persons  since there are always people who do not recognize this
right in the authorized persons or assemblies 

but this assumption  that what seems evil to us is really evil 
shows a complete misunderstanding of the question  and lies at the
root of the argument of freethinking critics about the christian
religion   in this way  then  the discussions of my book on the
part of churchmen and freethinking critics alike showed me that
the majority of men simply do not understand either christs
teaching or the questions which christs teaching solves 




chapter iii 

christianity misunderstood by believers 

meaning of christian doctrine  understood by a minority  has become
completely incomprehensible for the majority of menreason of this to
be found in misinterpretation of christianity and mistaken conviction of
believers and unbelievers alike that they understand itthe meaning of
christianity obscured for believers by the churchthe first appearance
of christs teachingits essence and difference from heathen
religionschristianity not fully comprehended at the beginning  became
more and more clear to those who accepted it from its correspondence
with truthsimultaneously with this arose the claim to possession of
the authentic meaning of the doctrine based on the miraculous nature of
its transmissionassembly of disciples as described in the actsthe
authoritative claim to the sole possession of the true meaning of
christs teaching supported by miraculous evidence has led by logical
development to the creeds of the churchesa church could not be founded
by christdefinitions of a church according to the catechismsthe
churches have always been several in number and hostile to one
anotherwhat is heresythe work of g  arnold on heresiesheresies the
manifestations of progress in the churcheschurches cause dissension
among men  and are always hostile to christianityaccount of the work
done by the russian churchmatt  xxiii  23the sermon on the mount or
the creedthe orthodox church conceals from the people the true meaning
of christianitythe same thing is done by the other churchesall the
external conditions of modern life are such as to destroy the doctrine
of the church  and therefore the churches use every effort to support
their doctrines 


thus the information i received  after my book came out  went to
show that the christian doctrine  in its direct and simple sense 
was understood  and had always been understood  by a minority of
men  while the critics  ecclesiastical and freethinking alike 
denied the possibility of taking christs teaching in its direct
sense   all this convinced me that while on one hand the true
understanding of this doctrine had never been lost to a minority 
but had been established more and more clearly  on the other hand
the meaning of it had been more and more obscured for the
majority   so that at last such a depth of obscurity has been
reached that men do not take in their direct sense even the
simplest precepts  expressed in the simplest words  in the gospel 

christs teaching is not generally understood in its true  simple 
and direct sense even in these days  when the light of the gospel
has penetrated even to the darkest recesses of human
consciousness  when  in the words of christ  that which was spoken
in the ear is proclaimed from the housetops  and when the gospel
is influencing every side of human lifedomestic  economic 
civic  legislative  and international   this lack of true
understanding of christs words at such a time would be
inexplicable  if there were not causes to account for it 

one of these causes is the fact that believers and unbelievers
alike are firmly persuaded that they have understood christs
teaching a long time  and that they understand it so fully 
indubitably  and conclusively that it can have no other
significance than the one they attribute to it   and the reason of
this conviction is that the false interpretation and consequent
misapprehension of the gospel is an error of such long standing 
even the strongest current of water cannot add a drop to a cup
which is already full 

the most difficult subjects can be explained to the most slowwitted man
if he has not formed any idea of them already  but the simplest thing
cannot be made clear to the most intelligent man if he is firmly
persuaded that he knows already  without a shadow of doubt  what is laid
before him 

the christian doctrine is presented to the men of our world today
as a doctrine which everyone has known so long and accepted so
unhesitatingly in all its minutest details that it cannot be
understood in any other way than it is understood now 

christianity is understood now by all who profess the doctrines of
the church as a supernatural miraculous revelation of everything
which is repeated in the creed   by unbelievers it is regarded as
an illustration of mans craving for a belief in the supernatural 
which mankind has now outgrown  as an historical phenomenon which
has received full expression in catholicism  greek orthodoxy  and
protestantism  and has no longer any living significance for us 
the significance of the gospel is hidden from believers by the
church  from unbelievers by science 

i will speak first of the former   eighteen hundred years ago
there appeared in the midst of the heathen roman world a strange
new doctrine  unlike any of the old religions  and attributed to a
man  christ 

this new doctrine was in both form and content absolutely new to
the jewish world in which it originated  and still more to the
roman world in which it was preached and diffused 

in the midst of the elaborate religious observances of judaism  in
which  in the words of isaiah  law was laid upon law  and in the midst
of the roman legal system worked out to the highest point of perfection 
a new doctrine appeared  which denied not only every deity  and all fear
and worship of them  but even all human institutions and all necessity
for them  in place of all the rules of the old religions  this doctrine
sets up only a type of inward perfection  truth  and love in the person
of christ  andas a result of this inward perfection being attained by
menalso the outward perfection foretold by the prophetsthe kingdom
of god  when all men will cease to learn to make war  when all shall be
taught of god and united in love  and the lion will lie down with the
lamb  instead of the threats of punishment which all the old laws of
religions and governments alike laid down for nonfulfillment of their
rules  instead of promises of rewards for fulfillment of them  this
doctrine called men to it only because it was the truth  john vii  17
if any man will do his will  he shall know of the doctrine whether it
be of god  john viii  46 if i say the truth  why do ye not believe
me  but ye seek to kill me  a man that hath told you the truth  ye shall
know the truth  and the truth shall make you free  god is a spirit  and
they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth  keep my
sayings  and ye shall know of my sayings whether they be true  no
proofs of this doctrine were offered except its truth  the
correspondence of the doctrine with the truth  the whole teaching
consisted in the recognition of truth and following it  in a greater and
greater attainment of truth  and a closer and closer following of it in
the acts of life  there are no acts in this doctrine which could justify
a man and make him saved  there is only the image of truth to guidehim 
for inward perfection in the person of christ  and for outward
perfection in the establishment of the kingdom of god  the fulfillment
of this teaching consists only in walking in the chosen way  in getting
nearer to inward perfection in the imitation of christ  and outward
perfection in the establishment of the kingdom of god  the greater or
less blessedness of a man depends  according to this doctrine  not on
the degree of perfection to which he has attained  but on the greater or
less swiftness with which he is pursuing it 

the progress toward perfection of the publican zaccheus  of the woman
that was a sinner  of the robber on the cross  is a greater state of
blessedness  according to this doctrine  than the stationary
righteousness of the pharisee  the lost sheep is dearer than ninetynine
that were not lost  the prodigal son  the piece of money that was lost
and found again  are dearer  more precious to god than those which have
not been lost 

every condition  according to this doctrine  is only a particular
step in the attainment of inward and outward perfection  and
therefore has no significance of itself   blessedness consists in
progress toward perfection  to stand still in any condition
whatever means the cessation of this blessedness 

let not thy left hand know what they right hand doeth   no man
having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the
kingdom of god   rejoice not that the spirits are subject to
you  but seek rather that your names be written in heaven   be
ye perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect   seek ye
first the kingdom of heaven and its righteousness 

the fulfillment of this precept is only to be found in
uninterrupted progress toward the attainment of ever higher truth 
toward establishing more and more firmly an ever greater love
within oneself  and establishing more and more widely the kingdom
of god outside oneself 

it is obvious that  appearing as it did in the midst of the jewish
and heathen world  such teaching could not be accepted by the
majority of men  who were living a life absolutely different from
what was required by it   it is obvious  too  that even for those
by whom it was accepted  it was so absolutely opposed to all their
old views that it could not be comprehensible in its full
significance 

it has been only by a succession of misunderstandings  errors 
partial explanations  and the corrections and additions of
generations that the meaning of the christian doctrine has grown
continually more and more clear to men   the christian view of
life has exerted an influence on the jewish and heathen  and the
heathen and jewish view of life has  too  exerted an influence on
the christian   and christianity  as the living force  has gained
more and more upon the extinct judaism and heathenism  and has
grown continually clearer and clearer  as it freed itself from the
admixture of falsehood which had overlaid it   men went further
and further in the attainment of the meaning of christianity  and
realized it more and more in life 

the longer mankind lived  the clearer and clearer became the
meaning of christianity  as must always be the case with every
theory of life 

succeeding generations corrected the errors of their predecessors 
and grew ever nearer and nearer to a comprehension of the true
meaning   it was thus from the very earliest times of
christianity   and so  too  from the earliest times of
christianity there were men who began to assert on their own
authority that the meaning they attribute to the doctrine is the
only true one  and as proof bring forward supernatural occurrences
in support of the correctness of their interpretation 

this was the principal cause at first of the misunderstanding of
the doctrine  and afterward of the complete distortion of it 

it was supposed that christs teaching was transmitted to men not
like every other truth  but in a special miraculous way   thus the
truth of the teaching was not proved by its correspondence with
the needs of the mind and the whole nature of man  but by the
miraculous manner of its transmission  which was advanced as an
irrefutable proof of the truth of the interpretation put on it 
this hypothesis originated from misunderstanding of the teaching 
and its result was to make it impossible to understand it rightly 

and this happened first in the earliest times  when the doctrine
was still not so fully understood and often interpreted wrongly 
as we see by the gospels and the acts   the less the doctrine was
understood  the more obscure it appeared and the more necessary
were external proofs of its truth   the proposition that we ought
not to do unto others as we would not they should do unto us  did
not need to be proved by miracles and needed no exercise of faith 
because this proposition is in itself convincing and in harmony
with mans mind and nature  but the proposition that christ was
god had to be proved by miracles completely beyond our
comprehension 

the more the understanding of christs teaching was obscured  the
more the miraculous was introduced into it  and the more the
miraculous was introduced into it  the more the doctrine was
strained from its meaning and the more obscure it became  and the
more it was strained from its meaning and the more obscure it
became  the more strongly its infallibility had to be asserted 
and the less comprehensible the doctrine became 

one can see by the gospels  the acts  and the epistles how from
the earliest times the noncomprehension of the doctrine called
forth the need for proofs through the miraculous and
incomprehensible 

the first example in the book of acts is the assembly which
gathered together in jerusalem to decide the question which had
arisen  whether to baptize or not the uncircumcised and those who
had eaten of food sacrificed to idols 

the very fact of this question being raised showed that
those who discussed it did not understand the teaching of christ 
who rejected all outward observancesablutions  purifications 
fasts  and sabbaths   it was plainly said  not that which goeth
into a mans mouth  but that which cometh out of a mans mouth 
defileth him  and therefore the question of baptizing the
uncircumcised could only have arisen among men who  though they
loved their master and dimly felt the grandeur of his teaching 
still did not understand the teaching itself very clearly  and
this was the fact 

just in proportion to the failure of the members of the assembly
to understand the doctrine was their need of external confirmation
of their incomplete interpretation of it   and then to settle this
question  the very asking of which proved their misunderstanding
of the doctrine  there was uttered in this assembly  as is
described in the acts  that strange phrase  which was for the
first time found necessary to give external confirmation to
certain assertions  and which has been productive of so much evil 

that is  it was asserted that the correctness of what they had
decided was guaranteed by the miraculous participation of the holy
ghost  that is  of god  in their decision   but the assertion that
the holy ghost  that is  god  spoke through the apostles  in its
turn wanted proof   and thus it was necessary  to confirm this 
that the holy ghost should descend at pentecost in tongues of fire
upon those who made this assertion   in the account of it  the
descent of the holy ghost precedes the assembly  but the book of
acts was written much later than both events   but the descent of
the holy ghost too had to be proved for those who had not seen the
tongues of fire though it is not easy to understand why a tongue
of fire burning above a mans head should prove that what that man
is going to say will be infallibly the truth   and so arose the
necessity for still more miracles and changes  raisings of the
dead to life  and strikings of the living dead  and all those
marvels which have been a stumblingblock to men  of which the
acts is full  and which  far from ever convincing one of the truth
of the christian doctrine  can only repel men from it   the result
of such a means of confirming the truth was that the more these
confirmations of truth by tales of miracles were heaped up one
after another  the more the doctrine was distorted from its
original meaning  aid the more incomprehensible it became 

thus it was from the earliest times  and so it went on  constantly
increasing  till it reached in our day the logical climax of the dogmas
of transubstantiation and the infallibility of the pope  or of the
bishops  or of scripture  and of requiring a blind faith rendered
incomprehensible and utterly meaningless  not in god  but in christ  not
in a doctrine  but in a person  as in catholicism  or in persons  as in
greek orthodoxy  or in a book  as in protestantism  the more widely
christianity was diffused  and the greater the number of people
unprepared for it who were brought under its sway  the less it was
understood  the more absolutely was its infallibility insisted on  and
the less possible it became to understand the true meaning of the
doctrine  in the times of constantine the whole interpretation of the
doctrine had been already reduced to a r√©sum√©supported by the temporal
authorityof the disputes that had taken place in the councilto a
creed which reckoned offi believe in so and so  and so and so  and so
and so to the endto one holy  apostolic church  which means the
infallibility of those persons who call themselves the church  so that
it all amounts to a man no longer believing in god nor christ  as they
are revealed to him  but believing in what the church orders him to
believe in 

but the church is holy  the church was founded by christ   god
could not leave men to interpret his teaching at randomtherefore
he founded the church   all those statements are so utterly untrue
and unfounded that one is ashamed to refute them   nowhere nor in
anything  except in the assertion of the church  can we find that
god or christ founded anything like what churchmen understand by
the church   in the gospels there is a warning against the church 
as it is an external authority  a warning most clear and obvious
in the passage where it is said that christs followers should
call no man master   but nowhere is anything said of the
foundation of what churchmen call the church 

the word church is used twice in the gospelsonce in the sense of
an assembly of men to decide a dispute  the other time in
connection with the obscure utterance about a stonepeter  and
the gates of hell   from these two passages in which the word
church is used  in the signification merely of an assembly  has
been deduced all that we now understand by the church 

but christ could not have founded the church  that is  what we now
understand by that word   for nothing like the idea of the church
as we know it now  with its sacraments  miracles  and above all
its claim to infallibility  is to be found either in christs
words or in the ideas of the men of that time 

the fact that men called what was formed afterward by the same
word as christ used for something totally different  does not give
them the right to assert that christ founded the one  true church 

besides  if christ had really founded such an institution as the
church for the foundation of all his teaching and the whole faith 
he would certainly have described this institution clearly and
definitely  and would have given the only true church  besides
tales of miracles  which are used to support every kind of
superstition  some tokens so unmistakable that no doubt of its
genuineness could ever have arisen   but nothing of the sort was
done by him   and there have been and still are different
institutions  each calling itself the true church 

the catholic catechism says l√©glise est la soci√©t√© des fid√©les
√©tablie par notre seigneur j√©sus christ  r√©pandue sur toute la
terre et soumise √† lauthorit√© des pasteurs l√©gitimes

understanding by the words pasteurs l√©gitimes an association of
men having the pope at its head  and consisting of certain
individuals bound together by a certain organization 

    footnote the church is the society of the faithful 
    established by our lord jesus christ  spread over the
    whole earth  and subject to the authority of its lawful
    pastors  and chief of them our holy father the pope 

the greek orthodox catechism says the church is a society
founded upon earth by jesus christ  which is united into one
whole  by one divine doctrine and by sacraments  under the rule
and guidance of a priesthood appointed by god  meaning by the
priesthood appointed by god the greek orthodox priesthood 
consisting of certain individuals who happen to be in such or such
positions 

the lutheran catechism says the church is holy christianity  or
the collection of all believers under christ  their head  to whom
the holy ghost through the gospels and sacraments promises 
communicates  and administers heavenly salvation  meaning that
the catholic church is lost in error  and that the true means of
salvation is in lutheranism 

for catholics the church of god coincides with the roman
priesthood and the pope   for the greek orthodox believer the
church of god coincides with the establishment and priesthood of
russi  see footnote

    footnote homyakovs definition of the church  which
    was received with some favor among russians  does not
    improve matters  if we are to agree with homyakov in
    considering the greek orthodox church as the one true
    church   homyakov asserts that a church is a collection
    of men all without distinction of clergy and laymen
    united together by love  and that only to men united by
    love is the truth revealed let us love each other  that
    in the unity of thought  etc   and that such a church
    is the church which  in the first place  recognizes the
    nicene creed  and in the second place does not  after
    the division of the churches  recognize the popes and
    new dogmas   but with such a definition of the church 
    there is still more difficulty in reconciling  as
    homyakov tries to do  the church united by love with
    the church that recognizes the nicene creed and the
    doctrine of photius   so that homyakovs assertion that
    this church  united by love  and consequently holy 
    is the same church as the greek orthodox priesthood
    profess faith in  is even more arbitrary than the
    assertions of the catholics or the orthodox   if we
    admit the idea of a church in the sense homyakov
    gives to itthat is  a body of men bound together
    by love and truththen all that any man can predicate
    in regard to this body  if such an one exists  is
    its love and truth  but there can be no outer signs
    by which one could reckon oneself or another as a
    member of this holy body  nor by which one could put
    anyone outside it  so that no institution having
    an external existence can correspond to this ide 

for lutherans the church of god coincides with a body of men who
recognize the authority of the bible and luthers catechism 

ordinarily  when speaking of the rise of christianity  men
belonging to one of the existing churches use the word church in
the singular  as though there were and had been only one church 
but this is absolutely incorrect   the church  as an institution
which asserted that it possessed infallible truth  did not make
its appearance singly  there were at least two churches directly
this claim was made 

while believers were agreed among themselves and the body was one 
it had no need to declare itself as a church   it was only when
believers were split up into opposing parties  renouncing one
another  that it seemed necessary to each party to confirm their
own truth by ascribing to themselves infallibility   the
conception of one church only arose when there were two sides
divided and disputing  who each called the other side heresy  and
recognized their own side only as the infallible church 

if we knew that there was a church which decided in the year 51 to
receive the uncircumcised  it is only so because there was another
churchof the judaistswho decided to keep the uncircumcised
out 

if there is a catholic church now which asserts its own infallibility 
that is only because there are churchesgrecorussian  old orthodox 
and lutheraneach asserting its own infallibility and denying that of
all other churches  so that the one church is only a fantastic
imagination which has not the least trace of reality about it 

as a real historical fact there has existed  and still exist 
several bodies of men  each asserting that it is the one church 
founded by christ  and that all the others who call themselves
churches are only sects and heresies 

the catechisms of the churches of the most worldwide influencethe
catholic  the old orthodox  and the lutheranopenly assert this 

in the catholic catechism it is said quels sont ceux qui sont
hors de l√©glise   les infid√®les  les h√©r√©tiques  les
schismatiques  footnote who are those who are outside the
church  infidels  heretics  and schismatics   the socalled
greek orthodox are regarded as schismatics  the lutherans as
heretics  so that according to the catholic catechism the only
people in the church are catholics 

in the socalled orthodox catechism it is said by the one
christian church is understood the orthodox  which remains fully
in accord with the universal church   as for the roman church and
other sects the lutherans and the rest they do not even dignify
by the name of church  they cannot be included in the one true
church  since they have themselves separated from it 

according to this definition the catholics and lutherans are
outside the church  and there are only orthodox in the church 

the lutheran catechism says die wahre kirche wird darein
erkannt  dass in ihr das wort gottes lauter und rein ohne
menschenzus√§tze gelehrt and die sacramente treu nach christi
einsetzung gewahret werden  footnote the true church will be
known by the word of god being studied clear and unmixed with
mans additions and the sacraments being maintained faithful to
christs teaching 

according to this definition all those who have added anything to
the teaching of christ and the apostles  as the catholic and greek
churches have done  are outside the church   and in the church
there are only protestants 

the catholics assert that the holy ghost has been transmitted
without a break in their priesthood   the orthodox assert that the
same holy ghost has been transmitted without a break in their
priesthood   the arians asserted that the holy ghost was
transmitted in their priesthood they asserted this with just as
much right as the churches in authority now   the protestants of
every kindlutherans  reformed church  presbyterians  methodists

present in their communities   if the catholics assert that the
holy ghost  at the time of the division of the church into arian
and greek  left the church that fell away and remained in the one
true church  with precisely the same right the protestants of
every denomination can assert that at the time of the separation
of their church from the catholic the holy ghost left the catholic
and passed into the church they professed   and this is just what
they do 

every church traces its creed through an uninterrupted
transmission from christ and the apostles   and truly every
christian creed that has been derived from christ must have come
down to the present generation through a certain transmission 
but that does not prove that it alone of all that has been
transmuted  excluding all the rest  can be the sole truth 
admitting of no doubt 

every branch in a tree comes from the root in unbroken connection 
but the fact that each branch comes from the one root  does not
prove at all that each branch was the only one   it is precisely
the same with the church   every church presents exactly the same
proofs of the succession  and even the same miracles  in support
of its authenticity  as every other   so that there is but one
strict and exact definition of what is a church not of something
fantastic which we would wish it to be  but of what it is and has
been in realitya church is a body of men who claim for
themselves that they are in complete and sole possession of the
truth   and these bodies  having in course of time  aided by the
support of the temporal authorities  developed into powerful
institutions  have been the principal obstacles to the diffusion
of a true comprehension of the teaching of christ 

it could not be otherwise   the chief peculiarity which
distinguished christs teaching from previous religions consisted
in the fact that those who accepted it strove ever more and more
to comprehend and realize its teaching   but the church doctrine
asserted its own complete and final comprehension and realization
of it 

strange though it may seem to us who have been brought up in the
erroneous view of the church as a christian institution  and in
contempt for heresy  yet the fact is that only in what was called
heresy was there any true movement  that is  true christianity 
and that it only ceased to be so when those heresies stopped short
in their movement and also petrified into the fixed forms of a
church 

and  indeed what is a heresy   read all the theological works one
after another   in all of them heresy is the subject which first
presents itself for definition  since every theological work deals
with the true doctrine of christ as distinguished from the
erroneous doctrines which surround it  that is  heresies   yet you
will not find anywhere anything like a definition of heresy 

the treatment of this subject by the learned historian of
christianity  e  de pressens√©  in his histoire du dogme paris 
1869  under the heading ubi christus  ibi ecclesia  may serve
as an illustration of the complete absence of anything like a
definition of what is understood by the word heresy  here is what
he says in his introduction p  3

   je sais  que lon nous conteste le droit de qualifier ainsi
   that is  to call heresies les tendances qui furent si
   vivement combattues par les premiers p√®res   la d√©signation
   m√™me dh√©r√©sie semble une atteinte port√©e √† la libert√© de
   conscience et de pens√©e   nous ne pouvons partager ce scrupule 
   car il nirait √† rien moins qu√† enlever au christianisme tout
   caract√®re distinctif  see footnote

    footnote i know that our right to qualify thus the
    tendencies which were so actively opposed by the early
    fathers is contested   the very use of the word heresy
    seems an attack upon liberty of conscience and thought 
    we cannot share this scruple  for it would amount to
    nothing less than depriving christianity of all
    distinctive character 

and though he tells us that after constantines time the church
did actually abuse its power by designating those who dissented
from it as heretics and persecuting them  yet he says  when
speaking of early times

   l√©glise est une libre association  il y a tout profit a se

   christianisme   cette pr√©somption ne se transformeraitelle
   pas en certitude si nous reconnaissons dans la doctrine
   universellement repouss√©e par l√©glise les traits

   reconnaissons donc que sil existe une religion ou une
   doctrine qui sappelle christianisme  elle peut avoir ses
   h√©r√©sies  see footnote

    footnote the church is a free association  there is much to
    be gained by separation from it   conflict with error has no
    weapons other than thought and feeling   one uniform type of
    doctrine has not yet been elaborated  divergencies in
    secondary matters arise freely in east and west  theology is
    not wedded to invariable formulas   if in the midst of this
    diversity a mass of beliefs common to all is apparent  is one
    not justified in seeing in it  not a formulated system  framed
    by the representatives of pedantic authority  but faith itself
    in its surest instinct and its most spontaneous manifestation 
    if the same unanimity which is revealed in essential points of
    belief is found also in rejecting certain tendencies  are we
    not justified in concluding that these tendencies were in
    flagrant opposition to the fundamental principles of
    christianity   and will not this presumption be transformed
    into certainty if we recognize in the doctrine universally
    rejected by the church the characteristic features of one of
    the religions of the past   to say that gnosticism or
    ebionitism are legitimate forms of christian thought  one must
    boldly deny the existence of christian thought at all  or any
    specific character by which it could be recognized   while
    ostensibly widening its realm  one undermines it   no one in
    the time of plato would have ventured to give his name to a
    doctrine in which the theory of ideas had no place  and one
    would deservedly have excited the ridicule of greece by trying
    to pass off epicurus or zeno as a disciple of the academy 
    let us recognize  then  that if a religion or a doctrine
    exists which is called christianity  it may have its
    heresies 

the authors whole argument amounts to this that every opinion
which differs from the code of dogmas we believe in at a given
time  is heresy   but of course at any given time and place men
always believe in something or other  and this belief in
something  indefinite at any place  at some time  cannot be a
criterion of truth 

it all amounts to this since ubi christus ibi ecclesia  then
christus is where we are 

every socalled heresy  regarding  as it does  its own creed as
the truth  can just as easily find in church history a series of
illustrations of its own creed  can use all pressens√©s arguments
on its own behalf  and can call its own creed the one truly
christian creed   and that is just what all heresies do and have
always done 

the only definition of heresy the word greek word  means a
part is this the name given by a body of men to any opinion
which rejects a part of the creed professed by that body   the
more frequent meaning  more often ascribed to the word heresy  is
that of an opinion which rejects the church doctrine founded and
supported by the temporal authorities

there is a remarkable and voluminous work  very little known 
unpartheyische kirchen und ketzerhistorie  1729  by gottfried
arnold  which deals with precisely this subject  and points out
all the unlawfulness  the arbitrariness  the senselessness  and
the cruelty of using the word heretic in the sense of reprobate 
this book is an attempt to write the history of christianity in
the form of a history of heresy 

in the introduction the author propounds a series of questions
1 of those who make heretics  2 of those whom they made
heretics  3 of heretical subjects themselves  4 of the method
of making heretics  and 5 of the object and result of making
heretics 

on each of these points he propounds ten more questions  the
answers to which he gives later on from the works of wellknown
theologians   but he leaves the reader to draw for himself the
principal conclusion from the expositions in the whole book   as
examples of these questions  in which the answers are to some
extent included also  i will quote the following  under the 4th
head  of the manner in which heretics are made  he says  in one of
the questions in the 7th

   does not all history show that the greatest makers of
   heretics and masters of that craft were just these wise men 
   from whom the father hid his secrets  that is  the hypocrites 
   the pharisees  and lawyers  men utterly godless and perverted
   question 2021   and in the corrupt times of christianity
   were not these very men cast out  denounced by the hypocrites
   and envious  who were endowed by god with great gifts and who
   would in the days of pure christianity have been held in high
   honor   and  on the other hand  would not the men who  in the
   decline of christianity raised themselves above all  and
   regarded themselves as the teachers of the purest christianity 
   would not these very men  in the times of the apostles and
   disciples of christ  have been regarded as the most shameless
   heretics and antichristians 

he expounds  among other things in these questions  the theory
that any verbal expression of faith  such as was demanded by the
church  and the departure from which was reckoned as heresy  could
never fully cover the exact religious ideas of a believer  and
that therefore the demand for an expression of faith in certain
words was ever productive of heresy  and he says  in question 21

   and if heavenly things and thoughts present themselves to a
   mans mind as so great and so profound that he does not find
   corresponding words to express them  ought one to call him a
   heretic  because he cannot express his idea with perfect
   exactness 

and in question 33

   and is not the fact that there was no heresy in the earliest
   days due to the fact that the christians did not judge one
   another by verbal expressions  but by deed and by heart  since
   they had perfect liberty to express their ideas without the
   dread of being called heretics  was it not the easiest and most
   ordinary ecclesiastical proceeding  if the clergy wanted to get
   rid of or to ruin anyone  for them to cast suspicion on the
   persons belief  and to throw a cloak of heresy upon him  and
   by this means to procure his condemnation and removal 

   true though it may be that there were sins and errors among
   the socalled heretics  it is no less true and evident  he
   says farther on  from the innumerable examples quoted here
   i  e   in the history of the church and of heresy  that there
   was not a single sincere and conscientious man of any
   importance whom the churchmen would not from envy or other
   causes have ruined 

thus  almost two hundred years ago  the real meaning of heresy was
understood   and notwithstanding that  the same conception of it
has gone on existing up to now   and it cannot fail to exist so
long as the conception of a church exists   heresy is the obverse
side of the church   wherever there is a church  there must be the
conception of heresy   a church is a body of men who assert that
they are in possession of infallible truth   heresy is the opinion
of the men who do not admit the infallibility of the churchs
truth 

heresy makes its appearance in the church   it is the effort to
break through the petrified authority of the church   all effort
after a living comprehension of the doctrine has been made by
heretics   tertullian  origen  augustine  luther  huss 
savonarola  helchitsky  and the rest were heretics   it could not
be otherwise 

the follower of christ  whose service means an evergrowing
understanding of his teaching  and an evercloser fulfillment of
it  in progress toward perfection  cannot  just because he is a
follower  of christ  claim for himself or any other that he
understands christs teaching fully and fulfills it   still less
can he claim this for any body of men 

to whatever degree of understanding and perfection the follower of
christ may have attained  he always feels the insufficiency of his
understanding and fulfillment of it  and is always striving toward
a fuller understanding and fulfillment   and therefore  to assert
of ones self or of any body of men  that one is or they are in
possession of perfect understanding and fulfillment of christs
word  is to renounce the very spirit of christs teaching 

strange as it may seem  the churches as churches have always been 
and cannot but be  institutions not only alien in spirit to
christs teaching  but even directly antagonistic to it   with
good reason voltaire calls the church linf√¢me  with good reason
have all or almost all socalled sects of christians recognized
the church as the scarlet woman foretold in the apocalypse  with
good reason is the history of the church the history of the
greatest cruelties and horrors 

the churches as churches are not  as many people suppose 
institutions which have christian principles for their basis  even
though they may have strayed a little away from the straight path 
the churches as churches  as bodies which assert their own
infallibility  are institutions opposed to christianity   there is
not only nothing in common between the churches as such and
christianity  except the name  but they represent two principles
fundamentally opposed and antagonistic to one another   one
represents pride  violence  selfassertion  stagnation  and death 
the other  meekness  penitence  humility  progress  and life 

we cannot serve these two masters  we have to choose between
them 

the servants of the churches of all denominations  especially of
later times  try to show themselves champions of progress in
christianity   they make concessions  wish to correct the abuses
that have slipped into the church  and maintain that one cannot 
on account of these abuses  deny the principle itself of a
christian church  which alone can bind all men together in unity
and be a mediator between men and god   but this is all a mistake 
not only have churches never bound men together in unity  they
have always been one of the principal causes of division between
men  of their hatred of one another  of wars  battles 
inquisitions  massacres of st  bartholomew  and so on   and the
churches have never served as mediators between men and god   such
mediation is not wanted  and was directly forbidden by christ  who
has revealed his teaching directly and immediately to each man 
but the churches set up dead forms in the place of god  and far
from revealing god  they obscure him from mens sight   the
churches  which originated from misunderstanding of christs
teaching and have maintained this misunderstanding by their
immovability  cannot but persecute and refuse to recognize all
true understanding of christs words   they try to conceal this 
but in vain  for every step forward along the path pointed out for
us by christ is a step toward their destruction 

to hear and to read the sermons and articles in which church writers of
later times of all denominations speak of christian truths and virtues 
to hear or read these skillful arguments that have been elaborated
during centuries  and exhortations and professions  which sometimes seem
like sincere professions  one is ready to doubt whether the churches can
be antagonistic to christianity  it cannot be  one says  that these
people who can point to such men as chrysostom  f√©nelon  butler  and
others professing the christian faith  were antagonistic to
christianity  one is tempted to say  the churches may have strayed
away from christianity  they may be in error  but they cannot be hostile
to it  but we must look to the fruit to judge the tree  as christ
taught us  and if we see that their fruits were evil  that the results
of their activity were antagonistic to christianity  we cannot but admit
that however good the men werethe work of the church in which these
men took part was not christian  the goodness and worth of these men who
served the churches was the goodness and worth of the men  and not of
the institution they served  all the good men  such as francis of
assisi  and francis of sales  our tihon zadonsky  thomas √† kempis  and
others  were good men in spite of their serving an institution hostile
to christianity  and they would have been still better if they had not
been under the influence of the error which they were serving 

but why should we speak of the past and judge from the past  which
may have been misrepresented and misunderstood by us   the
churches  with their principles and their practice  are not a
thing of the past   the churches are before us today  and we can
judge of them to some purpose by their practical activity  their
influence on men 

what is the practical work of the churches today   what is their
influence upon men   what is done by the churches among us  among
the catholics and the protestants of all denominationswhat is
their practical work  and what are the results of their practical
work 

the practice of our russian socalled orthodox church is plain to
all   it is an enormous fact which there is no possibility of
hiding and about which there can be no disputing 

what constitutes the practical work of this russian church  this
immense  intensely active institution  which consists of a
regiment of half a million men and costs the people tens of
millions of rubles 

the practical business of the church consists in instilling by
every conceivable means into the mass of one hundred millions of
the russian people those extinct relics of beliefs for which there
is nowadays no kind of justification  in which scarcely anyone
now believes  and often not even those whose duty it is to diffuse
these false beliefs   to instill into the people the formulas of
byzantine theology  of the trinity  of the mother of god  of
sacraments  of grace  and so on  extinct conceptions  foreign to
us  and having no kind of meaning for men of our times 
forms only one part of the work of the russian church   another
part of its practice consists in the maintenance of idolworship
in the most literal meaning of the word  in the veneration of holy
relics  and of ikons  the offering of sacrifices to them  and the
expectation of their answers to prayer   i am not going to speak
of what is preached and what is written by clergy of scientific or
liberal tendencies in the theological journals   i am going to
speak of what is actually done by the clergy through the wide
expanse of the russian land among a people of one hundred
millions   what do they  diligently  assiduously  everywhere
alike  without intermission  teach the people   what do they
demand from the people in virtue of their socalled christian
faith 

i will begin from the beginning with the birth of a child   at the
birth of a child they teach them that they must recite a prayer
over the child and mother to purify them  as though without this
prayer the mother of a newborn child were unclean   to do this the
priest holds the child in his arms before the images of the saints
called by the people plainly gods and reads words of exorcizing
power  and this purifies the mother   then it is suggested to the
parents  and even exacted of them  under fear of punishment for
nonfulfillment  that the child must be baptized  that is  be
dipped by the priest three times into the water  while certain
words  understood by no one  are read aloud  and certain actions 
still less understood  are performed  various parts of the body
are rubbed with oil  and the hair is cut  while the sponsors blow
and spit at an imaginary devil   all this is necessary to purify
the child and to make him a christian   then it is instilled into
the parents that they ought to administer the sacrament to the
child  that is  give him  in the guise of bread and wine  a
portion of christs body to eat  as a result of which the child
receives the grace of god within it  and so on   then it is
suggested that the child as it grows up must be taught to pray 
to pray means to place himself directly before the wooden boards
on which are painted the faces of christ  the mother of god  and
the saints  to bow his head and his whole body  and to touch his
forehead  his shoulders and his stomach with his right hand 
holding his fingers in a certain position  and to utter some words
of slavonic  the most usual of which as taught to all children
are mother of god  virgin  rejoice thee  etc   etc 

then it is instilled into the child as it is brought up that at
the sight of any church or ikon he must repeat the same actioni  e  
cross himself   then it is instilled into him that on holidays
holidays are the days on which christ was born  though no one
knows when that was  on which he was circumcised  on which the
mother of god died  on which the cross was carried in procession 
on which ikons have been set up  on which a lunatic saw a vision 
and so onon holidays he must dress himself in his best clothes
and go to church  and must buy candles and place them there before
the images of the saints   then he must give offerings and prayers
for the dead  and little loaves to be cut up into threecornered
pieces  and must pray many times for the health and prosperity of
the tzar and the bishops  and for himself and his own affairs  and
then kiss the cross and the hand of the priest 
besides these observances  it is instilled into him that at
least once a year he must confess   to confess means to go to the
church and to tell the priest his sins  on the theory that this
informing a stranger of his sins completely purifies him from
them   and after that he must eat with a little spoon a morsel of
bread with wine  which will purify him still more   next it is
instilled into him that if a man and woman want their physical
union to be sanctified they must go to church  put on metal
crowns  drink certain potions  walk three times round a table to
the sound of singing  and that then the physical union of a man
and woman becomes sacred and altogether different from all other
such unions 

further it is instilled into him in his life that he must observe
the following rules not to eat butter or milk on certain days 
and on certain other days to sing te deums and requiems for the
dead  on holidays to entertain the priest and give him money  and
several times in the year to bring the ikons from the church  and
to carry them slung on his shoulders through the fields and
houses   it is instilled into him that on his deathbed a man must
not fail to eat bread and wine with a spoon  and that it will be
still better if he has time to be rubbed with sacred oil   this
will guarantee his welfare in the future life   after his death it
is instilled into his relatives that it is a good thing for the
salvation of the dead man to place a printed paper of prayers in
his hands  it is a good thing further to read aloud a certain book
over the dead body  and to pronounce the dead mans name in church
at a certain time   all this is regarded as faith obligatory on
everyone 

but if anyone wants to take particular care of his soul  then
according to this faith he is instructed that the greatest
security of the salvation of the soul in the world is attained by
offering money to the churches and monasteries  and engaging the
holy men by this means to pray for him  entering monasteries too
and kissing relics and miraculous ikons  are further means of
salvation for the soul 

according to this faith ikons and relics communicate a special
sanctity  power  and grace  and even proximity to these objects 
touching them  kissing them  putting candles before them  crawling
under them while they are being carried along  are all efficacious
for salvation  as well as te deums repeated before these holy
things 

so this  and nothing else  is the faith called orthodox  that is
the actual faith which  under the guise of christianity  has been
with all the forces of the church  and is now with especial zeal 
instilled into the people 

and let no one say that the orthodox teachers place the essential
part of their teaching in something else  and that all these are
only ancient forms  which it is not thought necessary to do away
with   that is false   this  and nothing but this  is the faith
taught through the whole of russia by the whole of the russian
clergy  and of late years with especial zeal   there is nothing
else taught   something different may be talked of and written of
in the capitals  but among the hundred millions of the people this
is what is done  this is what is taught  and nothing more 
churchmen may talk of something else  but this is what they teach
by every means in their power 

all this  and the worship of relics and of ikons  has been
introduced into works of theology and into the catechisms   thus
they teach it to the people in theory and in practice  using every
resource of authority  solemnity  pomp  and violence to impress
them   they compel the people  by overawing them  to believe in
this  and jealously guard this faith from any attempt to free the
people from these barbarous superstitions 

as i said when i published my book  christs teaching and his very
words about nonresistance to evil were for many years a subject
for ridicule and low jesting in my eyes  and churchmen  far from
opposing it  even encouraged this scoffing at sacred things   but
try the experiment of saying a disrespectful word about a hideous
idol which is carried sacrilegiously about moscow by drunken men
under the name of the ikon of the iversky virgin  and you will
raise a groan of indignation from these same churchmen   all that
they preach is an external observance of the rites of idolatry 
and let it not be said that the one does not hinder the other 
that these ought ye to have done  and not to leave the other
undone   all  therefore  whatsoever they bid you observe  that
observe and do  but do not ye after their works for they say  and
do not matt  xxiii  23  3 

this was spoken of the pharisees  who fulfilled all the external
observances prescribed by the law  and therefore the words
whatsoever they bid you observe  that observe and do  refer to
works of mercy and goodness  and the words do not ye after their
works  for they say and do not  refer to their observance of
ceremonies and their neglect of good works  and have exactly the
opposite meaning to that which the churchmen try to give to the
passage  interpreting it as an injunction to observe ceremonies 
external observances and the service of truth and goodness are for
the most part difficult to combine  the one excludes the other 
so it was with the pharisees  so it is now with church christians 

if a man can be saved by the redemption  by sacraments  and by
prayer  then he does not need good works 

the sermon on the mount  or the creed  one cannot believe in both  and
churchmen have chosen the latter  the creed is taught and is read as a
prayer in the churches  but the sermon on the mount is excluded even
from the gospel passages read in the churches  so that the congregation
never hears it in church  except on those days when the whole of the
gospel is read  indeed  it could not be otherwise  people who believe in
a wicked and senseless godwho has cursed the human race and devoted
his own son to sacrifice  and a part of mankind to eternal
tormentcannot believe in the god of love  the man who believes in a
god  in a christ coming again in glory to judge and to punish the quick
and the dead  cannot believe in the christ who bade us turn the left
cheek  judge not  forgive these that wrong us  and love our enemies  the
man who believes in the inspiration of the old testament and the sacred
character of david  who commanded on his deathbed the murder of an old
man who had cursed him  and whom he could not kill himself because he
was bound by an oath to him  and the similar atrocities of which the old
testament is full  cannot believe in the holy love of christ  the man
who believes in the churchs doctrine of the compatibility of warfare
and capital punishment with christianity cannot believe in the
brotherhood of all men 

and what is most important of allthe man who believes in
salvation through faith in the redemption or the sacraments 
cannot devote all his powers to realizing christs moral teaching
in his life 

the man who has been instructed by the church in the profane
doctrine that a man cannot be saved by his own powers  but that
there is another means of salvation  will infallibly rely upon
this means and not on his own powers  which  they assure him  it
is sinful to trust in 

the teaching of every church  with its redemption and sacraments 
excludes the teaching of christ  most of all the teaching of the
orthodox church with its idolatrous observances 

but the people have always believed of their own accord as they
believe now  will be said in answer to this   the whole history
of the russian people proves it   one cannot deprive the people of
their traditions   this statement  too  is misleading   the
people did certainly at one time believe in something like what
the church believes in now  though it was far from being the same
thing   in spite of their superstitious regard for ikons 
housespirits  relics  and festivals with wreaths of birch leaves 
there has still always been in the people a profound moral and
living understanding of christianity  which there has never been
in the church as a whole  and which is only met with in its best
representatives   but the people  notwithstanding all the
prejudices instilled into them by the government and the church 
have in their best representatives long outgrown that crude stage
of understanding  a fact which is proved by the springing up
everywhere of the rationalist sects with which russia is swarming
today  and on which churchmen are now carrying on an ineffectual
warfare   the people are advancing to a consciousness of the
moral  living side of christianity   and then the church
comes forward  not borrowing from the people  but zealously
instilling into them the petrified formalities of an extinct
paganism  and striving to thrust them back again into the
darkness from which they are emerging with such effort 

we teach the people nothing new  nothing but what they believe 
only in a more perfect form  say the churchmen   this is just
what the man did who tied up the fullgrown chicken and thrust it
back into the shell it had come out of 

i have often been irritated  though it would be comic if the
consequences were not so awful  by observing how men shut one
another in a delusion and cannot get out of this magic circle 

the first question  the first doubt of a russian who is beginning
to think  is a question about the ikons  and still more the
miraculous relics is it true that they are genuine  and that
miracles are worked through them   hundreds of thousands of men
put this question to themselves  and their principal difficulty in
answering it is the fact that bishops  metropolitans  and all men
in positions of authority kiss the relics and wonderworking
ikons   ask the bishops and men in positions of authority why they
do so  and they will say they do it for the sake of the people 
while the people kiss them because the bishops and men in
authority do so 

in spite of all the external varnish of modernity  learning  and
spirituality which the members of the church begin nowadays to
assume in their works  their articles  their theological journals 
and their sermons  the practical work of the russian church
consists of nothing more than keeping the people in their present
condition of coarse and savage idolatry  and worse still 
strengthening and diffusing superstition and religious ignorance 
and suppressing that living understanding of christianity which
exists in the people side by side with idolatry 

i remember once being present in the monks bookshop of the optchy
hermitage while an old peasant was choosing books for his
grandson  who could read   a monk pressed on him accounts of
relics  holidays  miraculous ikons  a psalter  etc   i asked the
old man  has he the gospel   no   give him the gospel in
russian  i said to the monk   that will not do for him 
answered the monk   there you have an epitome of the work of our
church 

but this is only in barbarous russia  the european and american
reader will observe   and such an observation is just  but only so
far as it refers to the government  which aids the church in its
task of stultification and corruption in russi 

it is true that there is nowhere in europe a government so
despotic and so closely allied with the ruling church   and
therefore the share of the temporal power in the corruption of the
people is greatest in russi   but it is untrue that the russian
church in its influence on the people is in any respect different
from any other church 

the churches are everywhere the same  and if the catholic  the
anglican  or the lutheran church has not at hand a government as
compliant as the russian  it is not due to any indisposition to
profit by such a government 

the church as a church  whatever it may becatholic  anglican 
lutheran  presbyterianevery church  in so far as it is a church 
cannot but strive for the same object as the russian church 
that object is to conceal the real meaning of christs teaching
and to replace it by their own  which lays no obligation on them 
excludes the possibility of understanding the true teaching of
christ  and what is the chief consideration  justifies the
existence of priests supported at the peoples expense 

what else has catholicism done  what else is it doing in its
prohibition of reading the gospel  and in its demand for
unreasoning submission to church authorities and to an infallible
pope   is the religion of catholicism any other than that of the
russian church   there is the same external ritual  the same
relics  miracles  and wonderworking images of notre dame  and the
same processions  the same loftily vague discussions of
christianity in books and sermons  and when it comes to practice 
the same supporting of the present idolatry   and is not the same
thing done in anglicanism  lutheranism  and every denomination of
protestantism which has been formed into a church   there is the
same duty laid on their congregations to believe in the dogmas
expressed in the fourth century  which have lost all meaning for
men of our times  and the same duty of idolatrous worship  if not
of relics and ikons  then of the sabbath day and the letter of the
bible   there is always the same activity directed to concealing
the real duties of christianity  and to putting in their place an
external respectability and cant  as it is so well described by
the english  who are peculiarly oppressed by it   in protestantism
this tendency is specially remarkable because it has not the
excuse of antiquity   and does not exactly the same thing show
itself even in contemporary revivalismthe revived calvinism and
evangelicalism  to which the salvation army owes its origin 

uniform is the attitude of all the churches to the teaching of
christ  whose name they assume for their own advantage 

the inconsistency of all church forms of religion with the
teaching of christ is  of course  the reason why special efforts
are necessary to conceal this inconsistency from people   truly 
we need only imagine ourselves in the position of any grownup
man  not necessarily educated  even the simplest man of the
present day  who has picked up the ideas that are everywhere in
the air nowadays of geology  physics  chemistry  cosmography  or
history  when he  for the first time  consciously compares them
with the articles of belief instilled into him in childhood  and
maintained by the churchesthat god created the world in six
days  and light before the sun  that noah shut up all the animals
in his ark  and so on  that jesus is also god the son  who created
all before time was  that this god came down upon earth to atone
for adams sin  that he rose again  ascended into heaven  and
sitteth on the right hand of the father  and will come in the
clouds to judge the world  and so on   all these propositions 
elaborated by men of the fourth century  had a certain meaning for
men of that time  but for men of today they have no meaning
whatever   men of the present day can repeat these words with
their lips  but believe them they cannot   for such sentences as
that god lives in heaven  that the heavens opened and a voice from
somewhere said something  that christ rose again  and ascended
somewhere in heaven  and again will come from somewhere on the
clouds  and so on  have no meaning for us 

a man who regarded the heavens as a solid  finite vault could
believe or disbelieve that god created the heavens  that the
heavens opened  that christ ascended into heaven  but for us all
these phrases have no sense whatever   men of the present can only
believe  as indeed they do  that they ought to believe in this 
but believe it they cannot  because it has no meaning for them 

even if all these phrases ought to be interpreted in a figurative
sense and are allegories  we know that in the first place all
churchmen are not agreed about it  but  on the contrary  the
majority stick to understanding the holy scripture in its literal
sense  and secondly  that these allegorical interpretations are
very varied and are not supported by any evidence 

but even if a man wants to force himself to believe in the
doctrines of the church just as they are taught to him  the
universal diffusion of education and of the gospel and of
communication between people of different forms of religion
presents a still more insurmountable obstacle to his doing so 

a man of the present day need only buy a gospel for three copecks and
read through the plain words  admitting of no misinterpretation  that
christ said to the samaritan woman that the father seeketh not
worshipers at jerusalem  nor in this mountain nor in that  but
worshipers in spirit and in truth  or the saying that the christian
must not pray like the heathen  nor for show  but secretly  that is  in
his closet  or that christs follower must call no man master or
fatherhe need only read these words to be thoroughly convinced that
the church pastors  who call themselves teachers in opposition to
christs precept  and dispute among themselves  constitute no kind of
authority  and that what the churchmen teach us is not christianity 
less even than that is necessary  even if a man nowadays did continue to
believe in miracles and did not read the gospel  mere association with
people of different forms of religion and faith  which happens so easily
in these days  compels him to doubt of the truth of his own faith  it
was all very well when a man did not see men of any other form of
religion than his own  he believed that his form of religion was the one
true one  but a thinking man has only to come into contactas
constantly happens in these dayswith people  equally good and bad  of
different denominations  who condemn each others beliefs  to doubt of
the truth of the belief he professes himself  in these days only a man
who is absolutely ignorant or absolutely indifferent to the vital
questions with which religion deals  can remain in the faith of the
church 

what deceptions and what strenuous efforts the churches must
employ to continue  in spite of all these tendencies subversive of
the faith  to build churches  to perform masses  to preach  to
teach  to convert  and  most of all  to receive for it all immense
emoluments  as do all these priests  pastors  incumbents 
superintendents  abbots  archdeacons  bishops  and archbishops 
they need special supernatural efforts   and the churches do  with
everincreasing intensity and zeal  make such efforts   with us in
russia  besides other means  they employ  simple brute force  as
there the temporal power is willing to obey the church   men who
refuse an external assent to the faith  and say so openly  are
either directly punished or deprived of their rights  men who
strictly keep the external forms of religion are rewarded and
given privileges 

that is how the orthodox clergy proceed  but indeed all churches
without exception avail themselves of every means for the purpose
one of the most important of which is what is now called
hypnotism 

every art  from architecture to poetry  is brought into
requisition to work its effect on mens souls and to reduce them
to a state of stupefaction  and this effect is constantly
produced   this use of hypnotizing influence on men to bring them
to a state of stupefaction is especially apparent in the
proceedings of the salvation army  who employ new practices to
which we are unaccustomed trumpets  drums  songs  flags 
costumes  marching  dancing  tears  and dramatic performances 

but this only displeases us because these are new practices   were
not the old practices in churches essentially the same  with their
special lighting  gold  splendor  candles  choirs  organ  bells 
vestments  intoning  etc  

but however powerful this hypnotic influence may be  it is not the
chief nor the most pernicious activity of the
church   the chief and most pernicious work of the church is that
which is directed to the deception of childrenthese very
children of whom christ said woe to him that offendeth one of
these little ones   from the very first awakening of the
consciousness of the child they begin to deceive him  to instill
into him with the utmost solemnity what they do not themselves
believe in  and they continue to instill it into him till the
deception has by habit grown into the childs nature   they
studiously deceive the child on the most important subject in
life  and when the deception has so grown into his life that it
would be difficult to uproot it  then they reveal to him the whole
world of science and reality  which cannot by any means be
reconciled with the beliefs that have been instilled into him 
leaving it to him to find his way as best he can out of these
contradictions 

if one set oneself the task of trying to confuse a man so that he
could not think clearly nor free himself from the perplexity of
two opposing theories of life which had been instilled into him
from childhood  one could not invent any means more effectual than
the treatment of every young man educated in our socalled
christian society 

it is terrible to think what the churches do to men  but
if one imagines oneself in the position of the men who constitute
the church  we see they could not act differently   the churches
are placed in a dilemma the sermon on the mount or the nicene
creedthe one excludes the other   if a man sincerely believes in
the sermon on the mount  the nicene creed must inevitably lose all
meaning and significance for him  and the church and its
representatives together with it   if a man believes in the nicene
creed  that is  in the church  that is  in those who call
themselves its representatives  the sermon on the mount becomes
superfluous for him   and therefore the churches cannot but make
every possible effort to obscure the meaning of the sermon on the
mount  and to attract men to themselves   it is only due to the
intense zeal of the churches in this direction that the influence
of the churches has lasted hitherto 

let the church stop its work of hypnotizing the masses  and
deceiving children even for the briefest interval of time  and men
would begin to understand christs teaching   but this
understanding will be the end of the churches and all their
influence   and therefore the churches will not for an instant
relax their zeal in the business of hypnotizing grownup people
and deceiving children   this  then  is the work of the churches
to instill a false interpretation of christs teaching into men 
and to prevent a true interpretation of it for the majority of
socalled believers 




chapter iv 

christianity misunderstood by men of science 

attitude of men of science to religions in generalwhat religion is 
and what is its significance for the life of humanitythree conceptions
of lifechristian religion the expression of the divine conception of
lifemisinterpretation of christianity by men of science  who study it
in its external manifestations due to their criticising it from
standpoint of social conception of lifeopinion  resulting from this
misinterpretation  that christs moral teaching is exaggerated and
cannot be put into practiceexpression of divine conception of life in
the gospelfalse ideas of men of science on christianity proceed from
their conviction that they have an infallible method of criticismfrom
which come two misconceptions in regard to christian doctrinefirst
misconception  that the teaching cannot be put into practice  due to the
christian religion directing life in a way different from that of the
social theory of lifechristianity holds up ideal  does not lay down
rulesto the animal force of man christ adds the consciousness of a
divine forcechristianity seems to destroy possibility of life only
when the ideal held up is mistaken for ruleideal must not be
loweredlife  according to christs teaching  is movementthe ideal
and the preceptssecond misconception shown in replacing love and
service of god by love and service of humanitymen of science imagine
their doctrine of service of humanity and christianity are
identicaldoctrine of service of humanity based on social conception of
lifelove for humanity  logically deduced from love of self  has no
meaning because humanity is a fictionchristian love deduced from love
of god  finds its object in the whole world  not in humanity
alonechristianity teaches man to live in accordance with his divine
natureit shows that the essence of the soul of man is love  and that
his happiness ensues from love of god  whom he recognizes as love within
himself 


now i will speak of the other view of christianity which hinders
the true understanding of itthe scientific view 

churchmen substitute for christianity the version they have framed
of it for themselves  and this view of christianity they regard as
the one infallibly true one 

men of science regard as christianity only the tenets held by the
different churches in the past and present  and finding that these
tenets have lost all the significance of christianity  they accept
it as a religion which has outlived its age 

to see clearly how impossible it is to understand the christian
teaching from such a point of view  one must form for oneself an
idea of the place actually held by religions in general  by the
christian religion in particular  in the life of mankind  and of
the significance attributed to them by science 

just as the individual man cannot live without having some theory
of the meaning of his life  and is always  though often
unconsciously  framing his conduct in accordance with the meaning
he attributes to his life  so too associations of men living in
similar conditionsnationscannot but have theories of the
meaning of their associated life and conduct ensuing from those
theories   and as the individual man  when he attains a fresh
stage of growth  inevitably changes his philosophy of life  and
the grownup man sees a different meaning in it from the child  so
too associations of mennationsare bound to change their
philosophy of life and the conduct ensuing from their philosophy 
to correspond with their development 

the difference  as regards this  between the individual man and
humanity as a whole  lies in the fact that the individual  in
forming the view of life proper to the new period of life on which
he is entering and the conduct resulting from it  benefits by the
experience of men who have lived before him  who have already
passed through the stage of growth upon which he is entering   but
humanity cannot have this aid  because it is always moving along a
hitherto untrodden track  and has no one to ask how to understand
life  and to act in the conditions on which it is entering and
through which no one has ever passed before 

nevertheless  just as a man with wife and children cannot continue
to look at life as he looked at it when he was a child  so too in
the face of the various changes that are taking place  the greater
density of population  the establishment of communication between
different peoples  the improvements of the methods of the struggle
with nature  and the accumulation of knowledge  humanity cannot
continue to look at life as of old  and it must frame a new
theory of life  from which conduct may follow adapted to the new
conditions on which it has entered and is entering 

to meet this need humanity has the special power of producing men
who give a new meaning to the whole of human lifea theory of
life from which follow new forms of activity quite different from
all preceding them   the formation of this philosophy of life
appropriate to humanity in the new conditions on which it is
entering  and of the practice resulting from it  is what is called
religion 

and therefore  in the first place  religion is not  as science
imagines  a manifestation which at one time corresponded with the
development of humanity  but is afterward outgrown by it   it is a
manifestation always inherent in the life of humanity  and is as
indispensable  as inherent in humanity at the present time as at
any other   secondly  religion is always the theory of the
practice of the future and not of the past  and therefore it is
clear that investigation of past manifestations cannot in any case
grasp the essence of religion 

the essence of every religious teaching lies not in the desire for
a symbolic expression of the forces of nature  nor in the dread of
these forces  nor in the craving for the marvelous  nor in the
external forms in which it is manifested  as men of science
imagine  the essence of religion lies in the faculty of men of
foreseeing and pointing out the path of life along which humanity
must move in the discovery of a new theory of life  as a result of
which the whole future conduct of humanity is changed and
different from all that has been before 

this faculty of foreseeing the path along which humanity must
move  is common in a greater or less degree to all men   but in
all times there have been men in whom this faculty was especially
strong  and these men have given clear and definite expression to
what all men felt vaguely  and formed a new philosophy of life
from which new lines of action followed for hundreds and thousands
of years 

of such philosophies of life we know three  two have already been
passed through by humanity  and the third is that we are passing
through now in christianity   these philosophies of life are three
in number  and only three  not because we have arbitrarily brought
the various theories of life together under these three heads  but
because all mens actions are always based on one of these three
views of lifebecause we cannot view life otherwise than in these
three ways 

these three views of life are as follows first  embracing the
individual  or the animal view of life  second  embracing the
society  or the pagan view of life  third  embracing the whole
world  or the divine view of life 

in the first theory of life a mans life is limited to his one
individuality  the aim of life is the satisfaction of the will of
this individuality   in the second theory of life a mans life is
limited not to his own individuality  but to certain societies and
classes of individuals to the tribe  the family  the clan  the
nation  the aim of life is limited to the satisfaction of the will
of those associations of individuals   in the third theory of life
a mans life is limited not to societies and classes of
individuals  but extends to the principle and source of lifeto
god 

these three conceptions of life form the foundation of all the
religious that exist or have existed 

the savage recognizes life only in himself and his personal
desires  his interest in life is concentrated on himself alone 
the highest happiness for him is the fullest satisfaction of his
desires  the motive power of his life is personal enjoyment  his
religion consists in propitiating his deity and in worshiping his
gods  whom he imagines as persons living only for their personal
aims 

the civilized pagan recognizes life not in himself alone  but in
societies of menin the tribe  the clan  the family  the kingdom
and sacrifices his personal good for these societies   the
motive power of his life is glory   his religion consists in the
exaltation of the glory of those who are allied to himthe
founders of his family  his ancestors  his rulersand in
worshiping gods who are exclusively protectors of his clan  his
family  his nation  his government see footnote 

    footnote the fact that so many varied forms of
    existence  as the life of the family  of the tribe 
    of the clan  of the state  and even the life of
    humanity theoretically conceived by the positivists 
    are founded on this social or pagan theory of life 
    does not destroy the unity of this theory of life 
    all these varied forms of life are founded on the
    same conception  that the life of the individual is
    not a sufficient aim of lifethat the meaning of
    life can be found only in societies of individuals 

the man who holds the divine theory of life recognizes life not in
his own individuality  and not in societies of individualities in
the family  the clan  the nation  the tribe  or the government 
but in the eternal undying source of lifein god  and to fulfill
the will of god he is ready to sacrifice his individual and family
and social welfare   the motor power of his life is love   and his
religion is the worship in deed and in truth of the principle of
the wholegod 

the whole historic existence of mankind is nothing else than the
gradual transition from the personal  animal conception of life to
the social conception of life  and from the social conception of
life to the divine conception of life   the whole history of the
ancient peoples  lasting through thousands of years and ending
with the history of rome  is the history of the transition from
the animal  personal view of life to the social view of life   the
whole of history from the time of the roman empire and the
appearance of christianity is the history of the transition 
through which we are still passing now  from the social view of
life to the divine view of life 

this view of life is the last  and founded upon it is the
christian teaching  which is a guide for the whole of our life and
lies at the root of all our activity  practical and theoretic 
yet men of what is falsely called science  pseudoscientific men 
looking at it only in its externals  regard it as something
outgrown and having no value for us 

reducing it to its dogmatic side onlyto the doctrines of the
trinity  the redemption  the miracles  the church  the sacraments 
and so onmen of science regard it as only one of an immense
number of religions which have arisen among mankind  and now  they
say  having played out its part in history  it is outliving its
own age and fading away before the light of science and of true
enlightenment 

we come here upon what  in a large proportion of cases  forms the
source of the grossest errors of mankind   men on a lower level of
understanding  when brought into contact with phenomena of a
higher order  instead of making efforts to understand them  to
raise themselves up to the point of view from which they must look
at the subject  judge it from their lower standpoint  and the less
they understand what they are talking about  the more confidently
and unhesitatingly they pass judgment on it 

to the majority of learned then  looking at the living  moral teaching
of christ from the lower standpoint of the conception of life  this
doctrine appears as nothing but very indefinite and incongruous
combination of indian asceticism  stoic and neoplatonic philosophy  and
insubstantial antisocial visions  which have no serious significance
for our times  its whole meaning is concentrated for them in its
external manifestationsin catholicism  protestantism  in certain
dogmas  or in the conflict with the temporal power  estimating the value
of christianity by these phenomena is like a deaf mans judging of the
character and quality of music by seeing the movements of the musicians 

the result of this is that all these scientific men  from kant 
strauss  spencer  and renan down  do not understand the meaning of
christs sayings  do not understand the significance  the object 
or the reason of their utterance  do not understand even the
question to which they form the answer   yet  without even taking
the pains to enter into their meaning  they refuse  if unfavorably
disposed  to recognize any reasonableness in his doctrines  or if
they want to treat them indulgently  they condescend  from the
height of their superiority  to correct them  on the supposition
that christ meant to express precisely their own ideas  but did
not succeed in doing so   they behave to his teaching much as
selfassertive people talk to those whom they consider beneath
them  often supplying their companions words yes  you mean to
say this and that   this correction is always with the aim of
reducing the teaching of the higher  divine conception of life to
the level of the lower  state conception of life 

they usually say that the moral teaching of christianity is very
fine  but overexaggerated  that to make it quite right we must
reject all in it that is superfluous and unnecessary to our manner
of life   and the doctrine that asks too much  and requires what
cannot be performed  is worse than that which requires of men what
is possible and consistent with their powers  these learned
interpreters of christianity maintain  repeating what was long ago
asserted  and could not but be asserted  by those who crucified
the teacher because they did not understand himthe jews 

it seems that in the judgment of the learned men of our
time the hebrew lawa tooth for a tooth  and an eye for
an eyeis a law of just retaliation  known to mankind five
thousand years before the law of holiness which christ
taught in its place 

it seems that all that has been done by those men who understood
christs teaching literally and lived in accordance with such an
understanding of it  all that has been said and done by all true
christians  by all the christian saints  all that is now reforming
the world in the shape of socialism and communismis simply
exaggeration  not worth talking about 

after eighteen hundred years of education in christianity the
civilized world  as represented by its most advanced thinkers 
holds the conviction that the christian religion is a religion of
dogmas  that its teaching in relation to life is unreasonable  and
is an exaggeration  subversive of the real lawful obligations of
morality consistent with the nature of man  and that very doctrine
of retribution which christ rejected  and in place of which he put
his teaching  is more practically useful for us 

to learned men the doctrine of nonresistance to evil by force is
exaggerated and even irrational   christianity is much better
without it  they think  not observing closely what christianity 
as represented by them  amounts to 

they do not see that to say that the doctrine of nonresistance to
evil is an exaggeration in christs teaching is just like saying
that the statement of the equality of the radii of a circle is an
exaggeration in the definition of a circle   and those who speak
thus are acting precisely like a man who  having no idea of what a
circle is  should declare that this requirement  that every point
of the circumference should be an equal distance from the center 
is exaggerated   to advocate the rejection of christs command of
nonresistance to evil  or its adaptation to the needs of life 
implies a misunderstanding of the teaching of christ 

and those who do so certainly do not understand it   they do not
understand that this teaching is the institution of a new theory
of life  corresponding to the new conditions on which men have
entered now for eighteen hundred years  and also the definition of
the new conduct of life which results from it   they do not
believe that christ meant to say what he said  or he seems to them
to have said what he said in the sermon on the mount and in other
places accidentally  or through his lack of intelligence or of
cultivation 

    footnote here  for example  is a characteristic
    view of that kind from the american journal the arena
    october  1890 new basis of church life   treating
    of the significance of the sermon on the mount and
    nonresistance to evil in particular  the author 
    being under no necessity  like the churchmen  to
    hide its significance  says

      christ in fact preached complete communism and
      anarchy  but one must learn to regard christ always
      in his historical and psychological significance 
      like every advocate of the love of humanity  christ
      went to the furthest extreme in his teaching   every
      step forward toward the moral perfection of humanity
      is always guided by men who see nothing but their
      vocation   christ  in no disparaging sense be it
      said  had the typical temperament of such a reformer 
      and therefore we must remember that his precepts
      cannot be understood literally as a complete
      philosophy of life   we ought to analyze his words
      with respect for them  but in the spirit of criticism 
      accepting what is true  etc 

    christ would have been happy to say what he ought  but
    he was not able to express himself as exactly and
    clearly as we can in the spirit of criticism  and
    therefore let us correct him   all that he said about
    meekness  sacrifice  lowliness  not caring for the
    morrow  was said by accident  through lack of knowing
    how to express himself scientifically 

matt  vi  2534 therefore i say unto you  take no thought for
your life  what ye shall eat  or what ye shall drink  nor yet for
your body  what ye shall put on   is not the life more than meat 
and the body than rainment   behold the fouls of the air  for they
sow not  neither do they reap  nor gather into barns  yet your
heavenly father feedeth them   are ye not much better than they 
which of you by taking thought can add one cubit onto his stature 
and why take ye thought for rainment  consider the lilies of the
field how they grow  they toil not  neither do they spin  and yet
i say unto you  that even solomon in all his glory was not arrayed
like one of these   wherefore  if god so clothe the grass of the
field  which today is  and tomorrow is cast into the oven  shall
he not much more clothe you  o ye of little faith   therefore take
no thought  saying  what shall we eat  or  what shall we drink 
or  wherewithal shall we be clothed   for after all these things
do the gentiles seek  for your heavenly father knoweth that ye
have need of all these things   but seek ye first the kingdom of
god  and his righteousness  and all these things shall be added
unto you   take therefore no thought for the morrow  for the
morrow shall take thought for the things of itself   sufficient
unto the day is the evil thereof   luke xii  3334 sell that ye
have  and give alms  provide yourselves bags which wax not old  a
treasure in the heavens that faileth not  where no thief
approacheth  neither moth corrupteth   for where your treasure is 
there will your heart be also   sell all thou hast and follow me 
and he who will not leave father  or mother  or children  or
brothers  or fields  or house  he cannot be my disciple   deny
thyself  take up thy cross each day and follow me   my meat is to
do the will of him that sent me  and to perform his works   not my
will  but thine be done  not what i will  but as thou wilt   life
is to do not ones will  but the will of god 

all these principles appear to men who regard them from the
standpoint of a lower conception of life as the expression of an
impulsive enthusiasm  having no direct application to life   these
principles  however  follow from the christian theory of life 
just as logically as the principles of paying a part of ones
private gains to the commonwealth and of sacrificing ones life in
defense of ones country follow from the state theory of life 

as the man of the stale conception of life said to the savage reflect 
bethink yourself  the life of your individuality cannot be true life 
because that life is pitiful and passing  but the life of a society and
succession of individuals  family  clan  tribe  or state  goes on
living  and therefore a man must sacrifice his own individuality for the
life of the family or the state  in exactly the same way the christian
doctrine says to the man of the social  state conception of life  repent
yegreek wordi  e   bethink yourself  or you will be ruined 
understand that this casual  personal life which now comes into being
and tomorrow is no more can have no permanence  that no external means 
no construction of it can give it consecutiveness and permanence  take
thought and understand that the life you are living is not real
lifethe life of the family  of society  of the state will not save you
from annihilation  the true  the rational life is only possible for man
according to the measure in which he can participate  not in the family
or the state  but in the source of lifethe father  according to the
measure in which he can merge his life in the life of the father  such
is undoubtedly the christian conception of life  visible in every
utterance of the gospel

one may not share this view of life  one may reject it  one may show its
inaccuracy and its erroneousness  but we cannot judge of the christian
teaching without mastering this view of life  still less can one
criticise a subject on a higher plane from a lower point of view  from
the basement one cannot judge of the effect of the spire  but this is
just what the learned critics of the day try to do  for they share the
erroneous idea of the orthodox believers that they are in possession of
certain infallible means for investigating a subject  they fancy if they
apply their socalled scientific methods of criticism  there can be no
doubt of their conclusion being correct 

this testing the subject by the fancied infallible method of
science is the principal obstacle to understanding the christian
religion for unbelievers  for socalled educated people   from
this follow all the mistakes made by scientific men about the
christian religion  and especially two strange misconceptions
which  more than everything else  hinder them from a correct
understanding of it   one of these misconceptions is that the
christian moral teaching cannot be carried out  and that therefore
it has either no force at allthat is  it should not be accepted
as the rule of conductor it must be transformed  adapted to the
limits within which its fulfillment is possible in our society 
another misconception is that the christian doctrine of love of
god  and therefore of his service  is an obscure  mystic
principle  which gives no definite object for love  and should
therefore be replaced by the more exact and comprehensible
principles of love for men and the service of humanity 

the first misconception in regard to the impossibility of
following the principle is the result of men of the state
conception of life unconsciously taking that conception as the
standard by which the christian religion directs men  and taking
the christian principle of perfection as the rule by which that
life is to be ordered  they think and say that to follow christs
teaching is impossible  because the complete fulfillment of all
that is required by this teaching would put an end to life   if a
man were to carry out all that christ teaches  he would destroy
his own life  and if all men carried it out  then the human race
would come to an end  they say 

if we take no thought for the morrow  what we shall eat and what
we shall drink  and wherewithal we shall be clothed  do not defend
our life  nor resist evil by force  lay down our life for others 
and observe perfect chastity  the human race cannot exist  they
say 

and they are perfectly right if they take the principle of
perfection given by christs teaching as a rule which everyone is
bound to fulfill  just as in the state principles of life everyone
is bound to carry out the rule of paying taxes  supporting the
law  and so on 

the misconception is based precisely on the fact that the teaching
of christ guides men differently from the way in which the
precepts founded on the lower conception of life guide men   the
precepts of the state conception of life only guide men by
requiring of them an exact fulfillment of rules or laws   christs
teaching guides men by pointing them to the infinite perfection of
their heavenly father  to which every man independently and
voluntarily struggles  whatever the degree of his imperfection in
the present 

the misunderstanding of men who judge of the christian principle
from the point of view of the state principle  consists in the
fact that on the supposition that the perfection which christ
points to  can be fully attained  they ask themselves just as
they ask the same question on the supposition that state laws will
be carried out what will be the result of all this being carried
out   this supposition cannot be made  because the perfection held
up to christians is infinite and can never be attained  and christ
lays down his principle  having in view the fact that absolute
perfection can never be attained  but that striving toward
absolute  infinite perfection will continually increase the
blessedness of men  and that this blessedness may be increased to
infinity thereby 

christ is teaching not angels  but men  living and moving in the animal
life  and so to this animal force of movement christ  as it were 
applies the new forcethe recognition of divine perfectionand thereby
directs the movement by the resultant of these two forces  

to suppose that human life is going in the direction to which
christ pointed it  is just like supposing that a little boat
afloat on a rabid river  and directing its course almost exactly
against the current  will progress in that direction 

christ recognizes the existence of both sides of the
parallelogram  of both eternal indestructible forces of which the
life of man is compounded the force of his animal nature and the
force of the consciousness of kinship to god   saying nothing of
the animal force which asserts itself  remains always the same 
and is therefore independent of human will  christ speaks only of
the divine force  calling upon a man to know it more closely  to
set it more free from all that retards it  and to carry it to a
higher degree of intensity 

in the process of liberating  of strengthening this force  the
true life of man  according to christs teaching  consists   the
true life  according to preceding religions  consists in carrying
out rules  the law  according to christs teaching it consists in
an ever closer approximation to the divine perfection held up
before every man  and recognized within himself by every man  in
an ever closer and closer approach to the perfect fusion of his
will in the will of god  that fusion toward which man strives  and
the attainment of which would be the destruction of the life me
know 

the divine perfection is the asymptote of human life to which it
is always striving  and always approaching  though it can only be
reached in infinity 

the christian religion seems to exclude the possibility of life only
when men mistake the pointing to an ideal as the laying down of a
rule   it is only then that the principles presented in christs
teaching appear to be destructive of life   these principles  on
the contrary  are the only ones that make true life possible 
without these principles true life could not be possible 

one ought not to expect so much  is what people usually say in
discussing the requirements of the christian religion   one
cannot expect to take absolutely no thought for the morrow  as is
said in the gospel  but only not to take too much thought for it 
one cannot give away all to the poor  but one must give away a
certain definite part  one need not aim at virginity  but one must
avoid debauchery  one need not forsake wife and children  but one
must not give too great a place to them in ones heart  and so
on 

but to speak like this is just like telling a man who is
struggling on a swift river and is directing his course against
the current  that it is impossible to cross the river rowing
against the current  and that to cross it he must float in the
direction of the point he wants to reach 

in reality  in order to reach the place to which he wants to go 
he must row with all his strength toward a point
much higher up 

to let go the requirements of the ideal means not only to diminish
the possibility of perfection  but to make an end of the ideal
itself   the ideal that has power over men is not an ideal
invented by someone  but the ideal that every man carries within
his soul   only this ideal of complete infinite perfection has
power over men  and stimulates them to action   a moderate
perfection loses its power of influencing mens hearts 

christs teaching only has power when it demands absolute
perfectionthat is  the fusion of the divine nature which exists
in every mans soul with the will of godthe union of the son
with the father   life according to christs teaching consists of
nothing but this setting free of the son of god  existing in every
man  from the animal  and in bringing him closer to the father 

the animal existence of a man does not constitute human life
alone    life  according to the will of god only  is also not
human life   human life is a combination of the animal life and
the divine life   and the more this combination approaches to the
divine life  the more life there is in it 

life  according to the christian religion  is a progress toward
the divine perfection   no one condition  according to this
doctrine  can be higher or lower than another   every condition 
according to this doctrine  is only a particular stage  of no
consequence in itself  on the way toward unattainable perfection 
and therefore in itself it does not imply a greater or lesser
degree of life   increase of life  according to this  consists in
nothing but the quickening of the progress toward perfection   and
therefore the progress toward perfection of the publican zaccheus 
of the woman that was a sinner  and of the robber on the cross 
implies a higher degree of life than the stagnant righteousness of
the pharisee   and therefore for this religion there cannot be
rules which it is obligatory to obey   the man who is at a lower
level but is moving onward toward perfection is living a more
moral  a better life  is more fully carrying out christs
teaching  than the man on a much higher level of morality who is
not moving onward toward perfection 

it is in this sense that the lost sheep is dearer to the father
than those that were not lost   the prodigal son  the piece of
money lost and found again  were more precious than those that
were not lost 

the fulfillment of christs teaching consists in moving away from
self toward god   it is obvious that there cannot be definite laws
and rules for this fulfillment of the teaching   every degree of
perfection and every degree of imperfection are equal in it  no
obedience to laws constitutes a fulfillment of this doctrine  and
therefore for it there can be no binding rules and laws 

from this fundamental distinction between the religion of christ
and all preceding religions based on the state conception of life 
follows a corresponding difference in the special precepts of the
state theory and the christian precepts   the precepts of the
state theory of life insist for the most part on certain practical
prescribed acts  by which men are justified and secure of being
right   the christian precepts the commandment of love is not a
precept in the strict sense of the word  but the expression of the
very essence of the religion are the five commandments of the
sermon on the mountall negative in character   they show only
what at a certain stage of development of humanity men may not do 

these commandments are  as it were  signposts on the endless road
to perfection  toward which humanity is moving  showing the point
of perfection which is possible at a certain period in the
development of humanity 

christ has given expression in the sermon on the mount to the
eternal ideal toward which men are spontaneously struggling  and
also the degree of attainment of it to which men may reach in our
times 

the ideal is not to desire to do ill to anyone  not to provoke ill
will  to love all men   the precept  showing the level below which
we cannot fall in the attainment of this ideal  is the prohibition
of evil speaking   and that is the first command 

the ideal is perfect chastity  even in thought   the precept 
showing the level below which we cannot fall in the attainment of
this ideal  is that of purity of married life  avoidance of
debauchery   that is the second command 

the ideal is to take no thought for the future  to live in the
present moment   the precept  showing the level below which we
cannot fall  is the prohibition of swearing  of promising anything
in the future   and that is the third command 

the ideal is never for any purpose to use force   the precept 
showing the level below which we cannot fall is that of returning
good for evil  being patient under wrong  giving the cloak also 
that is the fourth command 

the ideal is to love the enemies who hate us   the precept 
showing the level below which we cannot fall  is not to do evil to
our enemies  to speak well of them  and to make no difference
between them and our neighbors 

all these precepts are indications of what  on our journey to
perfection  we are already fully able to avoid  and what we must
labor to attain now  and what we ought by degrees to translate
into instinctive and unconscious habits   but these precepts  far
from constituting the whole of christs teaching and exhausting
it  are simply stages on the way to perfection   these precepts
must and will be followed by higher and higher precepts on the way
to the perfection held up by the religion 

and therefore it is essentially a part of the christian religion
to make demands higher than those expressed in its precepts  and
by no means to diminish the demands either of the ideal itself  or
of the precepts  as people imagine who judge it from the
standpoint of the social conception of life 

so much for one misunderstanding of the scientific men  in
relation to the import and aim of christs teaching   another
misunderstanding arising from the same source consists in
substituting love for men  the service of humanity  for the
christian principles of love for god and his service 

the christian doctrine to love god and serve him  and only as a
result of that love to love and serve ones neighbor  seems to
scientific men obscure  mystic  and arbitrary   and they would
absolutely exclude the obligation of love and service of god 
holding that the doctrine of love for men  for humanity alone  is
far more clear  tangible  and reasonable 

scientific men teach in theory that the only good and rational
life is that which is devoted to the service of the whole of
humanity   that is for them the import of the christian doctrine 
and to that they reduce christs teaching   they seek confirmation
of their own doctrine in the gospel  on the supposition that the
two doctrines are really the same 

this idea is an absolutely mistaken one   the christian doctrine
has nothing in common with the doctrine of the positivists 
communists  and all the apostles of the universal brotherhood of
mankind  based on the general advantage of such a brotherhood 
they differ from one another especially in christianitys having a
firm and clear basis in the human soul  while love for humanity is
only a theoretical deduction from analogy 

the doctrine of love for humanity alone is based on the social
conception of life 

the essence of the social conception of life consists in the
transference of the aim of the individual life to the life of
societies of individuals family  clan  tribe  or state   this
transference is accomplished easily and naturally in its earliest
forms  in the transference of the aim of life from the individual
to the family and the clan   the transference to the tribe or the
nation is more difficult and requires special training   and the
transference of the sentiment to the state is the furthest limit
which the process can reach 

to love ones self is natural to everyone  and no one needs any
encouragement to do so   to love ones clan who support and
protect one  to love ones wife  the joy and help of ones
existence  ones children  the hope and consolation of ones life 
and ones parents  who have given one life and education  is
natural   and such love  though far from being so strong as love
of self  is met with pretty often 

to lovefor ones own sake  through personal prideones tribe 
ones nation  though not so natural  is nevertheless common   love
of ones own people who are of the same blood  the same tongue 
and the same religion as ones self is possible  though far from
being so strong as love of self  or even love of family or clan 
but love for a state  such as turkey  germany  england  austria 
or russia is a thing almost impossible   and though it is
zealously inculcated  it is only an imagined sentiment  it has no
existence in reality   and at that limit mans power of
transferring his interest ceases  and he cannot feel any direct
sentiment for that fictitious entity   the positivists  however 
and all the apostles of fraternity on scientific principles 
without taking into consideration the weakening of sentiment in
proportion to the extension of its object  draw further deductions
in theory in the same direction   since  they say  it was for
the advantage of the individual to extend his personal interest to
the family  the tribe  and subsequently to the nation and the
state  it would be still more advantageous to extend his interest
in societies of men to the whole of mankind  and so all to live
for humanity just as men live for the family or the state 

theoretically it follows  indeed  having extended the love and
interest for the personality to the family  the tribe  and thence
to the nation and the state  it would be perfectly logical for men
to save themselves the strife and calamities which result from the
division of mankind into nations and states by extending their
love to the whole of humanity   this would be most logical  and
theoretically nothing would appear more natural to its advocates 
who do not observe that love is a sentiment which may or may not
be felt  but which it is useless to advocate  and moreover  that
love must have an object  and that humanity is not an object   it
is nothing but a fiction 

the family  the tribe  even the state were not invented by men 
but formed themselves spontaneously  like anthills or swarms of
bees  and have a real existence   the man who  for the sake of his
own animal personality  loves his family  knows whom he loves
anna  dolly  john  peter  and so on   the man who loves his tribe
and takes pride in it  knows that he loves all the guelphs or all
the ghibellines  the man who loves the state knows that he loves
france bounded by the rhine  and the pyrenees  and its principal
city paris  and its history and so on   but the man who loves
humanitywhat does he love   there is such a thing as a state  as
a nation  there is the abstract conception of man  but humanity as
a concrete idea does not  and cannot exist 

humanity   where is the definition of humanity   where does it end
and where does it begin   does humanity end with the savage  the
idiot  the dipsomaniac  or the madman   if we draw a line
excluding from humanity its lowest representatives  where are we
to draw the line   shall we exclude the negroes like the
americans  or the hindoos like some englishmen  or the jews like
some others   if we include all men without exception  why should
we not include also the higher animals  many of whom are superior
to the lowest specimens of the human race 

we know nothing of humanity as an eternal object  and we know
nothing of its limits   humanity is a fiction  and it is
impossible to love it   it would  doubtless  be very advantageous
if men could love humanity just as they love their family   it
would be very advantageous  as communists advocate  to replace the
competitive  individualistic organization of mens activity by a
social universal organization  so that each would be for all and
all for each 

only there are no motives to lead men to do this   the
positivists  the communists  and all the apostles of fraternity on
scientific principles advocate the extension to the whole of
humanity of the love men feel for themselves  their families  and
the state   they forget that the love which they are discussing is
a personal love  which might expand in a rarefied form to embrace
a mans native country  but which disappears before it can embrace
an artificial state such as austria  england  or turkey  and which
we cannot even conceive of in relation to all humanity  an
absolutely mystic conception 

a man loves himself his animal personality  he loves his
family  he even loves his native country   why should he not love
humanity   that would be such an excellent thing   and by the way 
it is precisely what is taught by christianity   so think the
advocates of positivist  communistic  or socialistic fraternity 

it would indeed be an excellent thing   but it can never be  for
the love that is based on a personal or social conception of life
can never rise beyond love for the state 

the fallacy of the argument lies in the fact that the social
conception of life  on which love for family and nation is
founded  rests itself on love of self  and that love grows weaker
and weaker as it is extended from self to family  tribe 
nationality  and slate  and in the state we reach the furthest
limit beyond which it cannot go 

the necessity of extending the sphere of love is beyond dispute 
but in reality the possibility of this love is destroyed by the
necessity of extending its object indefinitely   and thus the
insufficiency of personal human love is made manifest 

and here the advocates of positivist  communistic  socialistic
fraternity propose to draw upon christian love to make up the
default of this bankrupt human love  but christian love only in
its results  not in its foundations   they propose love for
humanity alone  apart from love for god 

but such a love cannot exist   there is no motive to produce it 
christian love is the result only of the christian conception of
life  in which the aim of life is to love and serve god 

the social conception of life has led men  by a natural transition
from love of self and then of family  tribe  nation  and state  to
a consciousness of the necessity of love for humanity  a
conception which has no definite limits and extends to all living
things   and this necessity for love of what awakens no kind of
sentiment in a man is a contradiction which cannot be solved by
the social theory of life 

the christian doctrine in its full significance can alone solve
it  by giving a new meaning to life   christianity recognizes love
of self  of family  of nation  and of humanity  and not only of
humanity  but of everything living  everything existing  it
recognizes the necessity of an infinite extension of the sphere of
love   but the object of this love is not found outside self in
societies of individuals  nor in the external world  but within
self  in the divine self whose essence is that very love  which
the animal self is brought to feel the need of through its
consciousness of its own perishable nature 

the difference between the christian doctrine and those which
preceded it is that the social doctrine said live in opposition
to your nature understanding by this only the animal nature 
make it subject to the external law of family  society  and
state   christianity says live according to your nature
understanding by this the divine nature  do not make it subject
to anythingneither you an animal self nor that of othersand
you will attain the very aim to which you are striving when you
subject your external self 

the christian doctrine brings a man to the elementary
consciousness of self  only not of the animal self  but of the
divine self  the divine spark  the self as the son of god  as much
god as the father himself  though confined in an animal husk   the
consciousness of being the son of god  whose chief characteristic
is love  satisfies the need for the extension of the sphere of
love to which the man of the social conception of life had been
brought   for the latter  the welfare of the personality demanded
an everwidening extension of the sphere of love  love was a
necessity and was confined to certain objectsself  family 
society   with the christian conception of life  love is not a
necessity and is confined to no object  it is the essential
faculty of the human soul   man loves not because it is his
interest to love this or that  but because love is the essence of
his soul  because he cannot but love 

the christian doctrine shows man that the essence of his soul is
lovethat his happiness depends not on loving this or that
object  but on loving the principle of the wholegod  whom he
recognizes within himself as love  and therefore he loves all
things and all men 

in this is the fundamental difference between the christian
doctrine and the doctrine of the positivists  and all the
theorizers about universal brotherhood on nonchristian
principles 

such are the two principal misunderstandings relating to the
christian religion  from which the greater number of false
reasonings about it proceed   the first consists in the belief
that christs teaching instructs men  like all previous religions 
by rules  which they are bound to follow  and that these rules
cannot be fulfilled   the second is the idea that the whole
purport of christianity is to teach men to live advantageously
together  as one family  and that to attain this we need only
follow the rule of love to humanity  dismissing all thought of
love of god altogether 

the mistaken notion of scientific men that the essence of
christianity consists in the supernatural  and that its moral
teaching is impracticable  constitutes another reason
of the failure of men of the present day to understand
christianity

contradiction between our life and our christian conscience 

men think they can accept christianity without altering their
lifepagan conception of life does not correspond with present stage of
development of humanity  and christian conception alone can accord with
itchristian conception of life not yet understood by men  but the
progress of life itself will lead them inevitably to adopt itthe
requirements of a new theory of life always seem incomprehensible 
mystic  and supernaturalso seem the requirements of the christian
theory of life to the majority of menthe absorption of the christian
conception of life will inevitably be brought about as the result of
material and spiritual causesthe fact of men knowing the requirements
of the higher view of life  and yet continuing to preserve inferior
organizations of life  leads to contradictions and sufferings which
embitter existence and must result in its transformationthe

monetathe striking character of the military contradiction 


there are many reasons why christs teaching is not understood 
one reason is that people suppose they have understood it when
they have decided  as the churchmen do  that it was revealed by
supernatural means  or when they have studied  as the scientific
men do  the external forms in which it has been manifested 
another reason is the mistaken notion that it is impracticable 
and ought to be replaced by the doctrine of love for humanity 
but the principal reason  which is the source of all the other
mistaken ideas about it  is the notion that christianity is a
doctrine which can be accepted or rejected without any change of
life 

men who are used to the existing order of things  who like it and
dread its being changed  try to take the doctrine as a collection
of revelations and rules which one can accept without their
modifying ones life   while christs teaching is not only a
doctrine which gives rules which a man must follow  it unfolds a
new meaning in life  and defines a whole world of human activity
quite different from all that has preceded it and appropriate to
the period on which man is entering 

the life of humanity changes and advances  like the life of the
individual  by stages  and every stage has a theory of life
appropriate to it  which is inevitably absorbed by men   those who
do not absorb it consciously  absorb it unconsciously   it is the
same with the changes in the beliefs of peoples and of all
humanity as it is with the changes of belief of individuals   if
the father of a family continues to be guided in his conduct by
his childish conceptions of life  life becomes so difficult for
him that he involuntarily seeks another philosophy and readily
absorbs that which is appropriate to his age 

that is just what is happening now to humanity at this time of
transition through which we are passing  from the pagan conception
of life to the christian   the socialized man of the present day
is brought by experience of life itself to the necessity of
abandoning the pagan conception of life  which is inappropriate to
the present stage of humanity  and of submitting to the obligation
of the christian doctrines  the truths of which  however corrupt
and misinterpreted  are still known to him  and alone offer him a
solution of the contradictions surrounding him 

if the requirements of the christian doctrine seem strange and
even alarming to the man of the social theory of life  no less
strange  incomprehensible  and alarming to the savage of ancient
times seemed the requirements of the social doctrine when it was
not fully understood and could not be foreseen in its results 

it is unreasonable  said the savage  to sacrifice my peace of
mind or my life in defense of something incomprehensible 
impalpable  and conventionalfamily  tribe  or nation  and above
all it is unsafe to put oneself at the disposal of the power of
others 

but the time came when the savage  on one hand  felt  though
vaguely  the value of the social conception of life  and of its
chief motor power  social censure  or social approbationglory 
and when  on the other hand  the difficulties of his personal life
became so great that he could not continue to believe in the value
of his old theory of life   then he accepted the social  state
theory of life and submitted to it 

that is just what the man of the social theory of life is passing
through now 

it is unreasonable  says the socialized man  to sacrifice my
welfare and that of my family and my country in order to fulfill
some higher law  which requires me to renounce my most natural and
virtuous feelings of love of self  of family  of kindred  and of
country  and above all  it is unsafe to part with the security of
life afforded by the organization of government 

but the time is coming when  on one hand  the vague consciousness
in his soul of the higher law  of love to god and his neighbor 
and  on the other hand  the suffering  resulting from the
contradictions of life  will force the man to reject the social
theory and to assimilate the new one prepared ready for him  which
solves all the contradictions and removes all his sufferingsthe
christian theory of life   and this time has now come 

we  who thousands of years ago passed through the transition  from
the personal  animal view of life to the socialized view  imagine
that that transition was an inevitable and natural one  but this
transition through which we have been passing for the last eighteen
hundred years seems arbitrary  unnatural  and alarming   but we
only fancy this because that first transition has been so fully
completed that the practice attained by it has become unconscious
and instinctive in us  while the present transition is not yet
over and we have to complete it consciously 

it took ages  thousands of years  for the social conception of
life to permeate mens consciousness   it went through various
forms and has now passed into the region of the instinctive
through inheritance  education  and habit   and therefore it seems
natural to us   but five thousand years ago it seemed as unnatural
and alarming to men as the christian doctrine in its true sense
seems today 

we think today that the requirements of the christian doctrineof
universal brotherhood  suppression of national distinctions  abolition
of private property  and the strange injunction of nonresistance to
evil by forcedemand what is impossible  but it was just the same
thousands of years ago  with every social or even family duty  such as
the duty of parents to support their children  of the young to maintain
the old  of fidelity in marriage  still more strange  and even
unreasonable  seemed the state duties of submitting to the appointed
authority  and paying taxes  and fighting in defense of the country  and
so on  all such requirements seem simple  comprehensible  and natural to
us today  and we see nothing mysterious or alarming in them  but three
or five thousand years ago they seemed to require what was impossible 

the social conception of life served as the basis of religion
because at the time when it was first presented to men it seemed
to them absolutely incomprehensible  mystic  and supernatural 
now that we have outlived that phase of the life of humanity  we
understand the rational grounds for uniting men in families 
communities  and states   but in antiquity the duties involved by
such association were presented under cover of the supernatural
and were confirmed by it 

the patriarchal religions exalted the family  the tribe  the
nation   state religions deified emperors and states   even now
most ignorant peoplelike our peasants  who call the tzar an
earthly godobey state laws  not through any rational recognition
of their necessity  nor because they have any conception of the
meaning of state  but through a religious sentiment 

in precisely the same way the christian doctrine is presented to
men of the social or heathen theory of life today  in the guise
of a supernatural religion  though there is in reality nothing
mysterious  mystic  or supernatural about it   it is simply the
theory of life which is appropriate to the present degree of
material development  the present stage of growth of humanity  and
which must therefore inevitably be accepted 

the time will comeit is already comingwhen the christian principles
of equality and fraternity  community of property  nonresistance of
evil by force  will appear just as natural and simple as the principles
of family or social life seem to us now 

humanity can no more go backward in its development than the
individual man   men have outlived the social  family  and state
conceptions of life  now they must go forward and assimilate the
next and higher conception of life  which is what is now taking
place   this change is brought about in two ways consciously
through spiritual causes  and unconsciously through material
causes 

just as the individual man very rarely changes his way of life at
the dictates of his reason alone  but generally continues to live
as before  in spite of the new interests and aims revealed to him
by his reason  and only alters his way of living when it has
become absolutely opposed to his conscience  and consequently
intolerable to him  so  too  humanity  long after it has learnt
through its religions the new interests and aims of life  toward
which it must strive  continues in the majority of its
representatives to live as before  and is only brought to accept
the new conception by finding it impossible to go on living its
old life as before 

though the need of a change of life is preached by the religious
leaders and recognized and realized by the most intelligent men 
the majority  in spite of their reverential attitude to their
leaders  that is  their faith in their teaching  continue to be
guided by the old theory of life in their present complex
existence   as though the father of a family  knowing how he ought
to behave at his age  should yet continue through habit and
thoughtlessness to live in the same childish way as he did in
boyhood 

that is just what is happening in the transition of humanity from
one stage to another  through which we are passing now   humanity
has outgrown its social stage and has entered upon a new period 
it recognizes the doctrine which ought to be made the basis of
life in this new period   but through inertia it continues to keep
up the old forms of life   from this inconsistency between the new
conception of life and practical life follows a whole succession
of contradictions and sufferings which embitter our life and
necessitate its alteration 

one need only compare the practice of life with the theory of it 
to be dismayed at the glaring antagonism between our conditions of
life and our conscience 

our whole life is in flat contradiction with all we know  and with
all we regard as necessary and right   this contradiction runs
through everything  in economic life  in political life  and in
international life   as though we had forgotten what we knew and
put away for a time the principles we believe in we cannot help
still believing in them because they are the only foundation we
have to base our life on we do the very opposite of all that our
conscience and our common sense require of us 

we are guided in economical  political  and international
questions by the principles which were appropriate to men of three
or five thousand years ago  though they are directly opposed to
our conscience and the conditions of life in which we are placed
today 

it was very well for the man of ancient times to live in a society
based on the division of mankind into masters and slaves  because
he believed that such a distinction was decreed by god and must
always exist   but is such a belief possible in these days 

the man of antiquity could believe he had the right to enjoy the
good things of this world at the expense of other men  and to keep
them in misery for generations  since he believed that men came
from different origins  were base or noble in blood  children of
ham or of japhet   the greatest sages of the world  the teachers
of humanity  plato and aristotle  justified the existence of
slaves and demonstrated the lawfulness of slavery  and even three
centuries ago  the men who described an imaginary society of the
future  utopia  could not conceive of it without slaves 

men of ancient and medieval times believed  firmly believed  that
men are not equal  that the only true men are persians  or greeks 
or romans  or franks   but we cannot believe that now   and people
who sacrifice themselves for the principles of aristocracy and of
patriotism toduty  dont believe and cant believe what they
assert 

we all know and cannot help knowingeven though we may never have
heard the idea clearly expressed  may never have read of it  and
may never have put it into words  still through unconsciously
imbibing the christian sentiments that are in the airwith our
whole heart we know and cannot escape knowing the fundamental
truth of the christian doctrine  that we are all sons of one
father  wherever we may live and whatever language we may speak 
we are all brothers and are subject to the same law of love
implanted by our common father in our hearts 

whatever the opinions and degree of education of a man of today 
whatever his shade of liberalism  whatever his school of
philosophy  or of science  or of economics  however ignorant or
superstitious he may be  every man of the present day knows that
all men have an equal right to life and the good things of life 
and that one set of people are no better nor worse than another 
that all are equal   everyone knows this  beyond doubt  everyone
feels it in his whole being   yet at the same time everyone sees
all round him the division of men into two castesthe one 
laboring  oppressed  poor  and suffering  the other idle 
oppressing  luxurious  and profligate   and everyone not only sees
this  but voluntarily or involuntarily  in one way or another  he
takes part in maintaining this distinction which his conscience
condemns   and he cannot help suffering from the consciousness of
this contradiction and his share in it 

whether he be master or slave  the man of today cannot help
constantly feeling the painful opposition between his conscience
and actual life  and the miseries resulting from it 

the toiling masses  the immense majority of mankind who are
suffering under the incessant  meaningless  and hopeless toil and
privation in which their whole life is swallowed up  still find
their keenest suffering in the glaring contrast between what is
and what ought to be  according to all the beliefs held by
themselves  and those who have brought them to that condition and
keep them in it 

they know that they are in slavery and condemned to privation and
darkness to minister to the lusts of the minority who keep them
down   they know it  and they say so plainly   and this knowledge
increases their sufferings and constitutes its bitterest sting 

the slave of antiquity knew that he was a slave by nature  but our
laborer  while he feels he is a slave  knows that he ought not to
be  and so he tastes the agony of tantalus  forever desiring and
never gaining what might and ought to be his 

the sufferings of the working classes  springing from the
contradiction between what is and what ought to be  are increased
tenfold by the envy and hatred engendered by their consciousness
of it 

the laborer of the present day would not cease to suffer even if
his toil were much lighter than that of the slave of ancient
times  even if he gained an eighthour working day and a wage of
three dollars a day   for he is working at the manufacture of
things which he will not enjoy  working not by his own will for
his own benefit  but through necessity  to satisfy the desires of
luxurious and idle people in general  and for the profit of a
single rich man  the owner of a factory or workshop in particular 
and he knows that all this is going on in a world in which it is a
recognized scientific principle that labor alone creates wealth 
and that to profit by the labor of others is immoral  dishonest 
and punishable by law  in a world  moreover  which professes to
believe christs doctrine that we are all brothers  and that true
merit and dignity is to be found in serving ones neighbor  not in
exploiting him   all this he knows  and he cannot but suffer
keenly from the sharp contrast between what is and what ought to
be 

according to all principles  according to all i know  and what
everyone professes  the workman says to himself   i ought to be
free  equal to everyone else  and loved  and i ama slave 
humiliated and hated   and he too is filled with hatred and tries
to find means to escape from his position  to shake off the enemy
who is overriding him  and to oppress him in turn   people say 
workmen have no business to try to become capitalists  the poor
to try to put themselves in the place of the rich   that is a
mistake   the workingmen and the poor would be wrong if they tried
to do so in a world in which slaves and masters were regarded as
different species created by god  but they are living in a world
which professes the faith of the gospel  that all are alike sons
of god  and so brothers and equal   and however men may try to
conceal it  one of the first conditions of christian life is love 
not in words but in deeds 

the man of the socalled educated classes lives in still more
glaring inconsistency and suffering   every educated man  if he
believes in anything  believes in the brotherhood of all men  or
at least he has a sentiment of humanity  or else of justice  or
else he believes in science   and all the while he knows that his
whole life is framed on principles in direct opposition to it all 
to all the principles of christianity  humanity  justice  and
science 

he knows that all the habits in which he has been brought up  and
which he could not give up without suffering  can only be
satisfied through the exhausting  often fatal  toil of oppressed
laborers  that is  through the most obvious and brutal violation
of the principles of christianity  humanity  and justice  and even
of science that is  economic science   he advocates the
principles of fraternity  humanity  justice  and science  and yet
he lives so that he is dependent on the oppression of the working
classes  which he denounces  and his whole life is based on the
advantages gained by their oppression   moreover he is directing
every effort to maintaining this state of things so flatly opposed
to all his beliefs 

we are all brothersand yet every morning a brother or a sister
must empty the bedroom slops for me   we are all brothers  but
every morning i must have a cigar  a sweetmeat  an ice  and such
things  which my brothers and sisters have been wasting their
health in manufacturing  and i enjoy these things and demand them 
we are all brothers  yet i live by working in a bank  or
mercantile house  or shop at making all goods dearer for my
brothers   we are all brothers  but i live on a salary paid me for
prosecuting  judging  and condemning the thief or the prostitute
whose existence the whole tenor of my life tends to bring about 
and who i know ought not to be punished but reformed   we are all
brothers  but i live on the salary i gain by collecting taxes from
needy laborers to be spent on the luxuries of the rich and idle 
we are all brothers  but i take a stipend for preaching a false
christian religion  which i do not myself believe in  and which
only serves to hinder men from understanding true christianity 
i take a stipend as priest or bishop for deceiving men in the
matter of the greatest importance to them   we are all brothers 
but i will not give the poor the benefit of my educational 
medical  or literary labors except for money   we are all
brothers  yet i take a salary for being ready to commit murder 
for teaching men to murder  or making firearms  gunpowder  or
fortifications 

the whole life of the upper classes is a constant inconsistency 
the more delicate a mans conscience is  the more painful this
contradiction is to him 

a man of sensitive conscience cannot but suffer if he lives such a
life   the only means by which he can escape from this suffering
is by blunting his conscience  but even if some  men succeed in
dulling their conscience they cannot dull their fears 

the men of the higher dominating classes whose conscience is
naturally not sensitive or has become blunted  if they dont
suffer through conscience  suffer from fear and hatred   they are
bound to suffer   they know all the hatred of them existing  and
inevitably existing in the working classes   they are aware that
the working classes know that they are deceived and exploited  and
that they are beginning to organize themselves to shake off
oppression and revenge themselves on their oppressors   the higher
classes see the unions  the strikes  the may day celebrations  and
feel the calamity that is threatening them  and their terror
passes into an instinct of selfdefense and hatred   they know
that if for one instant they are worsted in the struggle with
their oppressed slaves  they will perish  because the slaves are
exasperated and their exasperation is growing more intense with
every day of oppression   the oppressors  even if they wished to
do so  could not make an end to oppression   they know that they
themselves will perish directly they even relax the harshness of
their oppression   and they do not relax it  in spite of all their
pretended care for the welfare of the working classes  for the
eighthour day  for regulation of the labor of minors and of
women  for savings banks and pensions   all that is humbug  or
else simply anxiety to keep the slave fit to do his work   but the
slave is still a slave  and the master who cannot live without a
slave is less disposed to set him free than ever 

the attitude of the ruling classes to the laborers is that of a
man who has felled his adversary to the earth and holds him down 
not so much because he wants to hold him down  as because he knows
that if he let him go  even for a second  he would himself be
stabbed  for his adversary is infuriated and has a knife in his
hand   and therefore  whether their conscience is tender or the
reverse  our rich men cannot enjoy the wealth they have filched
from the poor as the ancients did who believed in their right to
it   their whole life and all their enjoyments are embittered
either by the stings of conscience or by terror 

so much for the economic contradiction   the political
contradiction is even more striking 

all men are brought up to the habit of obeying the laws of the
state before everything   the whole existence of modern times is
defined by laws   a man marries and is divorced  educates his
children  and even in many countries professes his religious
faith in accordance with the law   what about the law then which
defines our whole existence   do men believe in it   do they
regard it as good   not at all   in the majority of cases people
of the present time do not believe in the justice of the law  they
despise it  but still they obey it   it was very well for the
men of the ancient world to observe their laws   they firmly
believed that their law it was generally of a religious
character was the only just law  which everyone ought to obey 
but is it so with us  we know and cannot help knowing that the law
of our country is not the one eternal law  that it is only one of
the many laws of different countries  which are equally imperfect 
often obviously wrong and unjust  and are criticised from every
point of view in the newspapers   the jew might well obey his
laws  since he had not the slightest doubt that god had written
them with his finger  the roman too might well obey the laws which
he thought had been dictated by the nymph egeri   men might well
observe the laws if they believed the tzars who made them were
gods anointed  or even if they thought they were the work of
assemblies of lawgivers who had the power and the desire to make
them as good as possible   but we all know how our laws are
made   we have all been behind the scenes  we know that they are
the product of covetousness  trickery  and party struggles  that
there is not and cannot be any real justice in them   and so
modern men cannot believe that obedience to civic or political
laws can satisfy the demands of the reason or of human nature 
men have long ago recognized that it is irrational to obey a law
the justice of which is very doubtful  and so they cannot but
suffer in obeying a law which they do not accept as judicious and
binding 

a man cannot but suffer when his whole life is defined beforehand
for him by laws  which he must obey under threat of punishment 
though he does not believe in their wisdom or justice  and often
clearly perceives their injustice  cruelty  and artificiality 

we recognize the uselessness of customs and import duties  and are
obliged to pay them   we recognize the uselessness of the
expenditure on the maintenance of the court and other members of
government  and we regard the teaching of the church as injurious 
but we are obliged to bear our share of the expenses of these
institutions   we regard the punishments inflicted by law as cruel
and shameless  but we must assist in supporting them   we regard
as unjust and pernicious the distribution of landed property  but
we are obliged to submit to it   we see no necessity for wars and
armies  but we must bear terribly heavy burdens in support of
troops and war expenses 

but this contradiction is nothing in comparison with the
contradiction which confronts us when we turn to international
questions  and which demands a solution  under pain of the loss of
the sanity and even the existence of the human race   that is the
contradiction between the christian conscience and war 

we are all christian nations living the same spiritual life  so that
every noble and pregnant thought  springing up at one end of the world 
is at once communicated to the whole of christian humanity and evokes
everywhere the same emotion at pride and rejoicing without distinction
of nationalities  we who love thinkers  philanthropists  poets  and
scientific men of foreign origin  and are as proud of the exploits of
father damien as if he were one of ourselves  we  who have a simple love
for men of foreign nationalities  frenchmen  germans  americans  and
englishmen  who respect their qualities  are glad to meet them and make
them so warmly welcome  cannot regard war with them as anything heroic 
we cannot even imagine without horror the possibility of a disagreement
between these people and ourselves which would call for reciprocal
murder  yet we are all bound to take a hand in this slaughter which is
bound to come to pass tomorrow not today 

it was very well for the jew  the greek  and the roman to defend
the independence of his nation by murder   for he piously believed
that his people was the only true  fine  and good people dear to
god  and all the rest were philistines  barbarians   men of
medieval timeseven up to the end of the last and beginning of
this centurymight continue to hold this belief   but however
much we work upon ourselves we cannot believe it   and this
contradiction for men of the present day has become so full of
horror that without its solution life is no longer possible 

we live in a time which is full of inconsistencies  writes count
komarovsky  the professor of international law  in his learned
treatise 

   the press of all countries is continually expressing the
   universal desire for peace  and the general sense of its
   necessity for all nations 

   representatives of governments  private persons  and official
   organs say the same thing  it is repeated in parliamentary
   debates  diplomatic correspondence  and even in state treaties 
   at the same time governments are increasing the strength of
   their armies every year  levying fresh taxes  raising loans 
   and leaving as a bequest to future generations the duty of
   repairing the blunders of the senseless policy of the present 
   what a striking contrast between words and deeds   of course
   governments will plead in justification of these measures that
   all their expenditure and armament are exclusively for purposes
   of defense   but it remains a mystery to every disinterested
   man whence they can expect attacks if all the great powers are
   singlehearted in their policy  in pursuing nothing but self
   defense   in reality it looks as if each of the great powers
   were every instant anticipating an attack on the part of the
   others   and this results in a general feeling of insecurity
   and superhuman efforts on the part of each government to
   increase their forces beyond those of the other powers   such a
   competition of itself increases the danger of war   nations
   cannot endure the constant increase of armies for long  and
   sooner or later they will prefer war to all the disadvantages
   of their present position and the constant menace of war   then
   the most trifling pretext will be sufficient to throw the whole
   of europe into the fire of universal war   and it is a mistaken
   idea that such a crisis might deliver us from the political and
   economical troubles that are crushing us   the experience of
   the wars of latter years teaches us that every war has only
   intensified national hatreds  made military burdens more
   crushing and insupportable  and rendered the political and
   economical grievous and insoluble 

modern europe keeps under arms an active army of nine millions of
men  writes enrico ferri 

   besides fifteen millions of reserve  with an outlay of four
   hundred millions of francs per annum   by continual increase of
   the armed force  the sources of social and individual
   prosperity are paralyzed  and the state of the modern world may
   be compared to that of a man who condemns himself to wasting
   from lack of nutrition in order to provide himself with arms 
   losing thereby the strength to use the arms he provides  under
   the weight of which he will at last succumb 

charles booth  in his paper read in london before the association
for the reform and codification of the law of nations  june 26 
1887  says the same thing   after referring to the same number 
nine millions of the active army and fifteen millions of reserve 
and the enormous expenditure of governments on the support and
arming of these forces  he says

   these figures represent only a small part of the real cost 
   because besides the recognized expenditure of the war budget of
   the various nations  we ought also to take into account the
   enormous loss to society involved in withdrawing from it such
   an immense number of its most vigorous men  who are taken from
   industrial pursuits and every kind of labor  as well as the
   enormous interest on the sums expended on military preparations
   without any return   the inevitable result of this expenditure
   on war and preparations for war is a continually growing
   national debt   the greater number of loans raised by the
   governments of europe were with a view to war   their total sum
   amounts to four hundred millions sterling  and these debts are
   increasing every year 

the same professor komarovsky says in another place

   we live in troubled times   everywhere we hear complaints of
   the depression of trade and manufactures  and the wretchedness
   of the economic position generally  the miserable conditions of
   existence of the working classes  and the universal
   impoverishment of the masses  but in spite of this  governments
   in their efforts to maintain their independence rush to the
   greatest extremes of senselessness  new taxes and duties are
   being devised everywhere  and the financial oppression of the
   nations knows no limits   if we glance at the budgets of the
   states of europe for the last hundred years  what strikes us
   most of all is their rapid and continually growing increase 

   how can we explain this extraordinary phenomenon which sooner
   or later threatens us all with inevitable bankruptcy 

   it is caused beyond dispute by the expenditure for the
   maintenance of armaments which swallows up a third and even a
   half of all the expenditure of european states   and the most
   melancholy thing is that one can foresee no limit to this
   augmentation of the budget and impoverishment of the masses 
   what is socialism but a protest against this abnormal position
   in which the greater proportion of the population of our world
   is placed 

we are ruining ourselves  says frederick passy in a letter read
before the last congress of universal peace in 1890 in london 

   we are ruining ourselves in order to be able to take part in
   the senseless wars of the future or to pay the interest on
   debts we have incurred by the senseless and criminal wars of
   the past   we are dying of hunger so as to secure the means of
   killing each other 

speaking later on of the way the subject is looked at in france 
he says

   we believe that  a hundred years after the declaration of the
   rights of man and of the citizen  the time has come to
   recognize the rights of nations and to renounce at once and
   forever all those undertakings based on fraud and force  which 
   under the name of conquests  are veritable crimes against
   humanity  and which  whatever the vanity of monarchs and the
   pride of nations may think of them  only weaken even those who
   are triumphant over them 

i am surprised at the way religion is carried on in this
country  said sir wilfrid lawson at the same congress 

   you send a boy to sunday school  and you tell him dear boy 
   you must love your enemies   if another boy strikes you  you
   mustnt hit him back  but try to reform him by loving him 
   well   the boy stays in the sunday school till he is fourteen
   or fifteen  and then his friends send him into the army   what
   has he to do in the army   he certainly wont love his enemy 
   quite the contrary  if he can only get at him  he will run him
   through with his bayonet   that is the nature of all religious
   teaching in this country   i do not think that that is a very
   good way of carrying out the precepts of religion   i think if
   it is a good thing for a boy to love his enemy  it is good for
   a grownup man 

there are in europe twentyeight millions of men under arms 
says wilson 

   to decide disputes  not by discussion  but by murdering one
   another   that is the accepted method for deciding disputes
   among christian nations   this method is  at the same time 
   very expensive  for  according to the statistics i have read 
   the nations of europe spent in the year 1872 a hundred and
   fifty millions sterling on preparations for deciding disputes
   by means of murder   it seems to me  therefore  that in such a
   state of things one of two alternatives must be admitted
   either christianity is a failure  or those who have undertaken
   to expound it have failed in doing so   until our warriors are
   disarmed and our armies disbanded  the have not the right to
   call ourselves a christian nation 

in a conference on the subject of the duty of christian ministers
to preach against war  g  d  bartlett said among other things

   if i understand the scriptures  i say that men are only
   playing with christianity so long as they ignore the question
   of war   i have lived a longish life and have heard our
   ministers preach on universal peace hardly half a dozen times 
   twenty years ago  in a drawing room  i dared in the presence of
   forty persons to moot the proposition that war was incompatible
   with christianity  i was regarded as an arrant fanatic   the
   idea that we could get on without war was regarded as
   unmitigated weakness and folly 

the catholic priest defourney has expressed himself in the same
spirit   one of the first precepts of the eternal law inscribed
in the consciences of all men  says the abby defourney 

   is the prohibition of taking the life or shedding the blood of
   a fellowcreature without sufficient cause  without being
   forced into the necessity of it   this is one of the
   commandments which is most deeply stamped in the heart of man 
   but so soon as it is a question of war  that is  of shedding
   blood in torrents  men of the present day do not trouble
   themselves about a sufficient cause   those who take part in
   wars do not even think of asking themselves whether there is
   any justification for these innumerable murders  whether they
   are justifiable or unjustifiable  lawful or unlawful  innocent
   or criminal  whether they are breaking that fundamental
   commandment that forbids killing without lawful cause 
   but their conscience is mute   war has ceased to be something
   dependent on moral considerations   in warfare men have in all
   the toil and dangers they endure no other pleasure than that of
   being conquerors  no sorrow other than that of being conquered 
   dont tell me that they are serving their country   a great
   genius answered that long ago in the words that have become a
   proverb without justice  what is an empire but a great band
   of brigands   and is not every band of brigands a little
   empire   they too have their laws  and they too make war to
   gain booty  and even for honor 

   the aim of the proposed institution the institution of an
   international board of arbitration is that the nations of
   europe may cease to be nations of robbers  and their armies 
   bands of brigands   and one must add  not only brigands  but
   slaves   for our armies are simply gangs of slaves at the
   disposal of one or two commanders or ministers  who exercise a
   despotic control over them without any real responsibility  as
   we very well know 

   the peculiarity of a slave is that he is a mere tool in the
   hands of his master  a thing  not a man   that is just what
   soldiers  officers  and generals are  going to murder and be
   murdered at the will of a ruler or rulers   military slavery is
   an actual fact  and it is the worst form of slavery  especially
   now when by means of compulsory service it lays its fetters on
   the necks of all the strong and capable men of a nation  to
   make them instruments of murder  butchers of human flesh  for
   that is all they are taken and trained to do 

   the rulers  two or three in number  meet together in cabinets 
   secretly deliberate without registers  without publicity  and
   consequently without responsibility  and send men to be
   murdered 

protests against armaments  burdensome to the people  have not
originated in our times  says signor e  g  monet 

   hear what montesquieu wrote in his day   france and one
   might say  europe will be ruined by soldiers   a new plague is
   spreading throughout europe   it attacks sovereigns and forces
   them to maintain an incredible number of armed men   this
   plague is infectious and spreads  because directly one
   government increases its armament  all the others do likewise 
   so that nothing is gained by it but general ruin 

   every government maintains as great an army as it possibly
   could maintain if its people were threatened with
   extermination  and people call peace this state of tension of
   all against all   and therefore europe is so ruined that if
   private persons were in the position of the governments of our
   continent  the richest of them would not have enough to live
   on   we are poor though we have the wealth and trade of the
   whole world 

   that was written almost 150 years ago  the picture seems drawn
   from the world of today  one thing only has changedthe form
   of government   in montesquieus time it was said that the
   cause of the maintenance of great armaments was the despotic
   power of kings  who made war in the hope of augmenting by
   conquest their personal revenues and gaining glory   people
   used to say then ah  if only people could elect those who
   would have the right to refuse governments the soldiers and the
   moneythen there would be an end to military politics   now
   there are representative governments in almost the whole of
   europe  and in spite of that  war expenditures and the
   preparations for war have increased to alarming proportions 

   it is evident that the insanity of sovereigns has gained
   possession of the ruling classes   war is not made now because
   one king has been wanting in civility to the mistress of
   another king  as it was in louis xiv s time   but the natural
   and honorable sentiments of national honor and patriotism are
   so exaggerated  and the public opinion of one nation so excited
   against another  that it is enough for a statement to be made
   even though it may be a false report that the ambassador of
   one state was not received by the principal personage of
   another state to cause the outbreak of the most awful and
   destructive war there has ever been seen   europe keeps more
   soldiers under arms today than in the time of the great
   napoleonic wars   all citizens with few exceptions are forced
   to spend some years in barracks   fortresses  arsenals  and
   ships are built  new weapons are constantly being invented  to
   be replaced in a short time by fresh ones  for  sad to say 
   science  which ought always to be aiming at the good of
   humanity  assists in the work of destruction  and is constantly
   inventing new means for killing the greatest number of men in
   the shortest time   and to maintain so great a multitude of
   soldiers and to make such vast preparations for murder 
   hundreds of millions are spent annually  sums which would be
   sufficient for the education of the people and for immense
   works of public utility  and which would make it possible to
   find a peaceful solution of the social question 

   europe  then  is  in this respect  in spite of all the
   conquests of science  in the same position as in the darkest
   and most barbarous days of the middle ages   all deplore this
   state of thingsneither peace nor warand all would be glad
   to escape from it   the heads of governments all declare that
   they all wish for peace  and vie with one another in the most
   solemn protestations of peaceful intentions   but the same day
   or the next they will lay a scheme for the increase of the
   armament before their legislative assembly  saying that these
   are the preventive measures they take for the very purpose of
   securing peace 

   but this is not the kind of peace we want   and the nations
   are not deceived by it   true peace is based on mutual
   confidence  while these huge armaments show open and utter lack
   of confidence  if not concealed hostility  between states 
   what should we say of a man who  wanting to show his friendly
   feelings for his neighbor  should invite him to discuss their
   differences with a loaded revolver in his hand 

   it is just this flagrant contradiction between the peaceful
   professions and the warlike policy of governments which all
   good citizens desire to put an end to  at any cost 

people are astonished that every year there are sixty thousand
cases of suicide in europe  and those only the recognized and
recorded casesand excluding russia and turkey  but one ought
rather to be surprised that there are so few   every man of the
present day  if we go deep enough into the contradiction between
his conscience and his life  is in a state of despair 

not to speak of all the other contradictions between modern life
and the conscience  the permanently armed condition of europe
together with its profession of christianity is alone enough to
drive any man to despair  to doubt of the sanity of mankind  and
to terminate an existence in this senseless and brutal world 
this contradiction  which is a quintessence of all the other
contradictions  is so terrible that to live and to take part in it
is only possible if one does not think of itif one is able to
forget it 

what  all of us  christians  not only profess to love one another  but
do actually live one common life  we whose social existence beats with
one common pulsewe aid one another  learn from one another  draw ever
closer to one another to our mutual happiness  and find in this
closeness the whole meaning of life and tomorrow some crazy ruler
will say some stupidity  and another will answer in the same spirit  and
then i must go expose myself to being murdered  and murder menwho have
done me no harmand more than that  whom i love  and this is not a
remote contingency  but the very thing we are all preparing for  which
is not only probable  but an inevitable certainty 

to recognize this clearly is enough to drive a man out of his
senses or to make him shoot himself   and this is just what does
happen  and especially often among military men   a man need only
come to himself for an instant to be impelled inevitably to such
an end 

and this is the only explanation of the dreadful intensity with
which men of modern times strive to stupefy themselves  with
spirits  tobacco  opium  cards  reading newspapers  traveling  and
all kinds of spectacles and amusements   these pursuits are
followed up as an important  serious business   and indeed they
are a serious business   if there were no external means of
dulling their sensibilities  half of mankind would shoot
themselves without delay  for to live in opposition to ones
reason is the most intolerable condition   and that is the
condition of all men of the present day   all men of the modern
world exist in a state of continual and flagrant antagonism
between their conscience and their way of life   this antagonism
is apparent in economic as well as political life   but most
striking of all is the contradiction between the christian law of
the brotherhood of men existing in the conscience and the
necessity under which all men are placed by compulsory military
service of being prepared for hatred and murderof being at the
same time a christian and a gladiator 




chapter vi 

attitude of men of the present day to war 

people do not try to remove the contradiction between life and
conscience by a change of life  but their cultivated leaders exert every
effort to obscure the demands of conscience  and justify their life  in
this way they degrade society below paganism to a state of primeval
barbarismundefined attitude of modern leaders of thought to war  to
universal militarism  and to compulsory service in armyone section
regards war as an accidental political phenomenon  to be avoided by
external measures onlypeace congressthe article in the revue des
revuesproposition of maxime du campvalue of boards of arbitration
and suppression of armiesattitude of governments to men of this
opinion and what they doanother section regards war as cruel  but
inevitablemaupassantroda third section regard war as necessary 
and not without its advantagesdoucetclaretiezolavog√º√© 


the antagonism between life and the conscience may be removed in
two ways by a change of life or by a change of conscience   and
there would seem there can be no doubt as to these alternatives 

a man may cease to do what he regards as wrong  but he cannot
cease to consider wrong what is wrong   just in the same way all
humanity may cease to do what it regards as wrong  but far from
being able to change  it cannot even retard for a time the
continual growth of a clearer recognition of what is wrong and
therefore ought not to be   and therefore it would seem inevitable
for christian men to abandon the pagan forms of society which they
condemn  and to reconstruct their social existence on the
christian principles they profess 

so it would be were it not for the law of inertia  as immutable a
force in men and nations as in inanimate bodies   in men it takes
the form of the psychological principle  so truly expressed in the
words of the gospel  they have loved darkness better than light
because their deeds were evil   this principle shows itself in
men not trying to recognize the truth  but to persuade themselves
that the life they are leading  which is what they like and are
used to  is a life perfectly consistent with truth 

slavery was opposed to all the moral principles advocated by plato
and aristotle  yet neither of them saw that  because to renounce
slavery would have meant the break up of the life they were
living   we see the same thing in our modern world 

the division of men into two castes  as well as the use of force
in government and war  are opposed to every moral principle
professed by our modern society   yet the cultivated and advanced
men of the day seem not to see it 

the majority  if not all  of the cultivated men of our day try
unconsciously to maintain the old social conception of life  which
justifies their position  and to hide from themselves and others
its insufficiency  and above all the necessity of adopting the
christian conception of life  which will mean the break up of the
whole existing social order   they struggle to keep up the
organization based on the social conception of life  but do not
believe in it themselves  because it is extinct and it is
impossible to believe in it 

all modern literaturephilosophical  political  and artisticis
striking in this respect   what wealth of idea  of form  of color 
what erudition  what art  but what a lack of serious matter  what
dread of any exactitude of thought or expression   subtleties 
allegories  humorous fancies  the widest generalizations  but
nothing simple and clear  nothing going straight to the point 
that is  to the problem of life 

but that is not all  besides these graceful frivolities  our
literature is full of simple nastiness and brutality  of arguments
which would lead men back in the most refined way to primeval
barbarism  to the principles not only of the pagan  but even of
the animal life  which we have left behind us five thousand years
ago 

and it could not be otherwise   in their dread of the christian
conception of life which will destroy the social order  which some
cling to only from habit  others also from interest  men cannot
but be thrown back upon the pagan conception of life and the
principles based on it  nowadays we see advocated not only
patriotism and aristocratic principles just as they were advocated
two thousand years ago  but even the coarsest epicureanism and
animalism  only with this difference  that the men who then
professed those views believed in them  while nowadays even the
advocates of such views do not believe in them  for they have no
meaning for the present day   no one can stand still when the
earth is shaking under his feet  if we do not go forward we must
go back   and strange and terrible to say  the cultivated men of
our day  the leaders of thought  are in reality with their subtle
reasoning drawing society back  not to paganism even  but to a
state of primitive barbarism 

this tendency on the part of the leading thinkers of the day is
nowhere more apparent than in their attitude to the phenomenon in
which all the insufficiency of the social conception of life is
presented in the most concentrated formin their attitude  that
is  to war  to the general arming of nations  and to universal
compulsory service 

the undefined  if not disingenuous  attitude of modern thinkers to
this phenomenon is striking  it takes three forms in cultivated
society   one section look at it as an incidental phenomenon 
arising out of the special political situation of europe  and
consider that this state of things can be reformed without a
revolution in the whole internal social order of nations  by
external measures of international diplomacy   another section
regard it as something cruel and hideous  but at the same time
fated and inevitable  like disease and death   a third party with
cool indifference consider war as an inevitable phenomenon 
beneficial in its effects and therefore desirable 

men look at the subject from different points of view  but all
alike talk of war as though it were something absolutely
independent of the will of those who take part in it   and
consequently they do not even admit the natural question which
presents itself to every simple man how about meought i to
take any part in it   in their view no question of this kind even
exists  and every man  however he may regard war from a personal
standpoint  must slavishly submit to the requirements of the
authorities on the subject 

the attitude of the first section of thinkers  those who see a way
out of war in international diplomatic measures  is well expressed
in the report of the last peace congress in london  and the
articles and letters upon war that appeared in no  8 of the revue
des revues  1891   the congress after gathering together from
various quarters the verbal and written opinion of learned men
opened the proceedings by a religious service  and after listening
to addresses for five whole days  concluded them by a public
dinner and speeches   they adopted the following resolutions

   1  the congress affirms its belief that the brotherhood of man
   involves as a necessary consequence a brotherhood of nations 

   2  the congress recognizes the important influence that
   christianity exercises on the moral and political progress of
   mankind  and earnestly urges upon ministers of the gospel and
   other religious teachers the duty of setting forth the
   principles of peace and good will toward men  and it recommends
   that the third sunday in december be set apart for that
   purpose 

   3  the congress expresses the opinion that all teachers of
   history should call the attention of the young to the grave
   evils inflicted on mankind in all ages by war  and to the fact
   that such war has been waged for most inadequate causes 

   4  the congress protests against the use of military drill in
   schools by way of physical exercise  and suggests the formation
   of brigades for saving life rather than of a quasimilitary
   character  and urges the desirability of impressing on the
   board of examiners who formulate the questions for examination
   the propriety of guiding the minds of children in the
   principles of peace 

   5  the congress holds that the doctrine of the rights of man
   requires that the aboriginal and weaker races  their
   territories and liberties  shall be guarded from injustice and
   fraud  and that these races shall be shielded against the vices
   so prevalent among the socalled advanced races of men   it
   further expresses its conviction that there should be concert
   of action among the nations for the accomplishment of these
   ends   the congress expresses its hearty appreciation of the
   resolutions of the antislavery conference held recently at
   brussels for the amelioration of the condition of the peoples
   of afric 

   6  the congress believes that the warlike prejudices and
   traditions which are still fostered in the various
   nationalities  and the misrepresentations by leaders of public
   opinion in legislative assemblies or through the press  are
   often indirect causes of war  and that these evils should be
   counteracted by the publication of accurate information tending
   to the removal of misunderstanding between nations  and
   recommends the importance of considering the question of
   commencing an international newspaper with such a purpose 

   7  the congress proposes to the interparliamentary conference
   that the utmost support should be given to every project for
   unification of weights and measures  coinage  tariff  postage 
   and telegraphic arrangements  etc   which would assist in
   constituting a commercial  industrial  and scientific union of
   the peoples 

   8  the congress  in view of the vast social and moral
   influence of woman  urges upon every woman to sustain the
   things that make for peace  as otherwise she incurs grave
   responsibility for the continuance of the systems of
   militarism 

   9  the congress expresses the hope that the financial reform
   association and other similar societies in europe and america
   should unite in considering means for establishing equitable
   commercial relations between states  by the reduction of import
   duties   the congress feels that it can affirm that the whole
   of europe desires peace  and awaits with impatience the
   suppression of armaments  which  under the plea of defense 
   become in their turn a danger by keeping alive mutual distrust 
   and are  at the same time  the cause of that general economic
   disturbance which stands in the way of settling in a
   satisfactory manner the problems of labor and poverty  which
   ought to take precedence of all others 

   10  the congress  recognizing that a general disarmament would
   be the best guarantee of peace and would lead to the solution
   of the questions which now most divide states  expresses the
   wish that a congress of representatives of all the states of
   europe may be assembled as soon as possible to consider the
   means of effecting a gradual general disarmament 

   11  the congress  in consideration of the fact that the
   timidity of a single power might delay the convocation of the
   abovementioned congress  is of opinion that the government
   which should first dismiss any considerable number of soldiers
   would confer a signal benefit on europe and mankind  because it
   would  by public opinion  oblige other governments to follow
   its example  and by the moral force of this accomplished fact
   would have increased rather than diminished the conditions of
   its national defense 

   12  the congress  considering the question of disarmament  as
   of peace in general  depends on public opinion  recommends the
   peace societies  as well as all friends of peace  to be active
   in its propaganda  especially at the time of parliamentary
   elections  in order that the electors should give their votes
   to candidates who are pledged to support peace  disarmament 
   and arbitration 

   13  the congress congratulates the friends of peace on the
   resolution adopted by the international american conference 
   held at washington in april last  by which it was recommended
   that arbitration should be obligatory in all controversies 
   whatever their origin  except only those which may imperil the
   independence of one of the nations involved 

   14  the congress recommends this resolution to the attention
   of european statesmen  and expresses the ardent desire that
   similar treaties may speedily be entered into between the other
   nations of the world 

   15  the congress expresses its satisfaction at the adoption by
   the spanish senate on june 16 last of a project of law
   authorizing the government to negotiate general or special
   treaties of arbitration for the settlement of all disputes
   except those relating to the independence or internal
   government of the states affected  also at the adoption of
   resolutions to a like effect by the norwegian storthing and by
   the italian chamber 

   16  the congress resolves that a committee be appointed to
   address communications to the principal political  religious 
   commercial  and labor and peace organizations  requesting them
   to send petitions to the governmental authorities praying that
   measures be taken for the formation of suitable tribunals for
   the adjudicature of international questions so as to avoid the
   resort to war 

   17  seeing 1 that the object pursued by all peace societies
   is the establishment of judicial order between nations  and 2
   that neutralization by international treaties constitutes a
   step toward this judicial state and lessens the number of
   districts in which war can be carried on  the congress
   recommends a larger extension of the rule of neutralization 
   and expresses the wish  1 that all treaties which at present
   assure to certain states the benefit of neutrality remain in
   force  or if necessary be amended in a manner to render the
   neutrality more effective  either by extending neutralization
   to the whole of the state or by ordering the demolition of
   fortresses  which constitute rather a peril than a guarantee
   for neutrality  2 that new treaties in harmony with the
   wishes of the populations concerned be concluded for
   establishing the neutralization of other states 

   18  the subcommittee proposes  1 that the annual peace
   congress should be held either immediately before the meeting
   of the annual subparliamentary conference  or immediately
   after it in the same town  2 that the question of an
   international peace emblem be postponed sine die  3 that the
   following resolutions be adopted

        to express satisfaction at the official overtures of the
      presbyterian church in the united states addressed to the
      highest representatives of each church organization in
      christendom to unite in a general conference to promote the
      substitution of international arbitration for war 

      b  to express in the name of the congress its profound
      reverence for the memory of aurelio saffi  the great italian
      jurist  a member of the committee of the international
      league of peace and liberty 

   4 that the memorial adopted by this congress and
   signed by the president to the heads of the civilized states
    should  as far as practicable  be presented to each power by
    influential deputations 

   5 that the following resolutions be adopted

        a resolution of thanks to the presidents of the various
      sittings of the congress 

      b  a resolution of thanks to the chairman  the secretaries 
      and the members of the bureau of the congress 

      c  a resolution of thanks to the conveners and members of
      the sectional committees 

      d  a resolution of thanks to rev  canon scott holland  rev 
      dr  reuen thomas  and rev  j  morgan gibbon for their pulpit
      addresses before the congress  and also to the authorities
      of st  pauls cathedral  the city temple  and stamford hill
      congregational church for the use of those buildings for
      public services 

      e  a letter of thanks to her majesty for permission to
      visit windror castle 

      f  and also a resolution of thanks to the lord mayor and
      lady mayoress  to mr  passmore edwards  and other friends
      who have extended their hospitality to the members of the
      congress 

   19  the congress places on record a heartfelt expression of
   gratitude to almighty god for the remarkable harmony and
   concord which have characterized the meetings of the assembly 
   in which so many men and women of varied nations  creeds 
   tongues  and races have gathered in closest cooperation  and
   for the conclusion of the labors of the congress  and expresses
   its firm and unshaken belief in the ultimate triumph of the
   cause of peace and of the principles advocated at these
   meetings 

the fundamental idea of the congress is the necessity 1 of
diffusing among all people by all means the conviction of the
disadvantages of war and the great blessing of peace  and 2 of
rousing governments to the sense of the superiority of
international arbitration over war and of the consequent
advisability and necessity of disarmament   to attain the first
aim the congress has recourse to teachers of history  to women 
and to the clergy  with the advice to the latter to preach on the
evil of war and the blessing of peace every third sunday in
december   to attain the second object the congress appeals to
governments with the suggestion that they should disband their
armies and replace war by arbitration 

to preach to men of the evil of war and the blessing of peace 
but the blessing of peace is so well known to men that  ever since
there have been men at all  their best wish has been expressed in
the greeting  peace be with you   so why preach about it 

not only christians  but pagans  thousands of years ago  all
recognized the evil of war and the blessing of peace   so that the
recommendation to ministers of the gospel to preach on the evil of
war and the blessing of peace every third sunday in december is
quite superfluous 

the christian cannot but preach on that subject every day of his
life   if christians and preachers of christianity do not do so 
there must be reasons for it   and until these have been removed
no recommendations will be effective   still less effective will
be the recommendations to governments to disband their armies and
replace them by international boards of arbitration   governments 
too  know very well the difficulty and the burdensomeness of
raising and maintaining forces  and if in spite of that knowledge
they do  at the cost of terrible strain and effort  raise and
maintain forces  it is evident that they cannot do otherwise  and
the recommendation of the congress can never change it   but the
learned gentlemen are unwilling to see that  and keep hoping to
find a political combination  through which governments shall be
induced to limit their powers themselves 

can we get rid of war  asks a learned writer in the revue des
revues 

   all are agreed that if it were to break out in europe  its
    consequences would be like those of the great inroads of
    barbarians   the existence of whole nationalities would be at
   stake  and therefore the war would be desperate  bloody 
   atrocious 

   this consideration  together with the terrible engines of
   destruction invented by modern science  retards the moment of
   declaring war  and maintains the present temporary situation 
   which might continue for an indefinite period  except for the
   fearful cost of maintaining armaments which are exhausting the
   european states and threatening to reduce nations to a state of
   misery hardly less than that of war itself 

   struck by this reflection  men of various countries have tried
   to find means for preventing  or at least for softening  the
   results of the terrible slaughter with which we are threatened 

   such are the questions brought forward by the peace congress
   shortly to be held in rome  and the publication of a pamphlet 
   sur le d√©sarmement 

   it is unhappily beyond doubt that with the present
   organization of the majority of european states  isolated from
   one another and guided by distinct interests  the absolute
   suppression of war is an illusion with which it would be
   dangerous to cheat ourselves   wiser rules and regulations
   imposed on these duels between nations might  however  at least
   limit its horrors 

   it is equally chimerical to reckon on projects of disarmament 
   the execution of which is rendered almost impossible by
   considerations of a popular character present to the mind of
   all our readers  this probably means that france cannot
   disband its army before taking its revenge   public opinion is
   not prepared to accept them  and moreover  the international
   relations between different peoples are not such as to make
   their acceptance possible   disarmament imposed on one nation
   by another in circumstances threatening its security would be
   equivalent to a declaration of war 

   however  one may admit that an exchange of ideas between the
   nations interested could aid  to a certain degree  in bringing
   about the good understanding indispensable to any negotiations 
   and would render possible a considerable reduction of the
   military expenditure which is crushing the nations of europe
   and greatly hindering the solution of the social question 
   which each individually must solve on pain of having internal
   war as the price for escaping it externally 

   we might at least demand the reduction of the enormous
   expenses of war organized as it is at present with a view to
   the power of invasion within twentyfour hours and a decisive
   battle within a week of the declaration of war 

   we ought to manage so that states could not make the attack
   suddenly and invade each others territories within twentyfour
   hours 

this practical notion has been put forth by maxime du camp  and
his article concludes with it 

the propositions of m  du camp are as follows

   1  a diplomatic congress to be held every year 

   2  no war to be declared till two months after the incident
   which provoked it   the difficulty here would be to decide
   precisely what incident did provoke the war  since whenever war
   is declared there are very many such incidents  and one would
   have to decide from which to reckon the two months interval 

   3  no war to be declared before it has been submitted to a
   plebiscitum of the nations preparing to take part in it 

   4  no hostilities to be commenced till a month after the
   official declaration of war 

no war to be declared   no hostilities to be commenced  etc 
but who is to arrange that no war is to be declared   who is to
compel people to do this and that   who is to force states to
delay their operations for a certain fixed time   all the other
states   but all these others are also states which want holding
in check and keeping within limits  and forcing  too   who is to
force them  and how   public opinion   but if there is a public
opinion which can force governments to delay their operations for
a fixed period  the same public opinion can force governments not
to declare war at all 

but  it will be replied  there may be such a balance of power 
such a pond√©ration de forces  as would lead states to hold back of
their own accord   well  that has been tried and is being tried
even now   the holy alliance was nothing but that  the league of
peace was another attempt at the same thing  and so on 

but  it will be answered  suppose all were agreed   if all were
agreed there would be no more war certainly  and no need for
arbitration either 

a court of arbitration   arbitration shall replace war  questions
shall be decided by a court of arbitration  the alabama question
was decided by a court of arbitration  and the question of the
caroline islands was submitted to the decision of the pope 
switzerland  belgium  denmark  and holland have all declared that
they prefer arbitration to war 

i dare say monaco has expressed the same preference   the only
unfortunate thing is that germany  russia  austria  and france
have not so far shown the same inclination   it is amazing how men
can deceive themselves when they find it necessary   governments
consent to decide their disagreements by arbitration and to
disband their armies   the differences between russia and poland 
between england and ireland  between austria and bohemia  between
turkey and the slavonic states  between france and germany  to be
soothed away by amiable conciliation 

one might as well suggest to merchants and bankers that they
should sell nothing for a greater price than they gave for it 
should undertake the distribution of wealth for no profit  and
should abolish money  as it would thus be rendered unnecessary 

but since commercial and banking operations consist in nothing but
selling for more than the cost price  this would be equivalent to
an invitation to suppress themselves   it is the same in regard to
governments   to suggest to governments that they should not have
recourse to violence  but should decide their misunderstandings in
accordance with equity  is inviting them to abolish themselves as
rulers  and that no government can ever consent to do 

the learned men form societies there are more than a hundred such
societies  assemble in congresses such as those recently held in
london and paris  and shortly to be held in rome  deliver
addresses  eat public dinners and make speeches  publish journals 
and prove by every means possible that the nations forced to
support millions of troops are strained to the furthest limits of
their endurance  that the maintenance of these huge armed forces
is in opposition to all the aims  the interests  and the wishes of
the people  and that it is possible  moreover  by writing numerous
papers  and uttering a great many words  to bring all men into
agreement and to arrange so that they shall have no antagonistic
interests  and then there will be no more war 

when i was a little boy they told me if i wanted to catch a bird i
must put salt on its tail   i ran after the birds with the salt in
my hand  but i soon convinced myself that if i could put salt on a
birds tail  i could catch it  and realized that i had been
hoaxed 

people ought to realize the same fact when they read books and
articles on arbitration and disarmament 

if one could put salt on a birds tail  it would be because it
could not fly and there would be no difficulty in catching it   if
the bird had wings and did not want to be caught  it would not let
one put salt on its tail  because the specialty of a bird is to
fly   in precisely the same way the specialty of government is not
to obey  but to enforce obedience   and a government is only a
government so long as it can make itself obeyed  and therefore it
always strives for that and will never willingly abandon its
power   but since it is on the army that the power of government
rests  it will never give up the army  and the use of the army in
war 

the error arises from the learned jurists deceiving themselves and
others  by asserting that government is not what it really is  one
set of men banded together to oppress another set of men  but  as
shown by science  is the representation of the citizens in their
collective capacity   they have so long been persuading other
people of this that at last they have persuaded themselves of it 
and thus they often seriously suppose that government can be bound
by considerations of justice   but history shows that from caesar
to napoleon  and from napoleon to bismarck  government is in its
essence always a force acting in violation of justice  and that it
cannot be otherwise   justice can have no binding force on a ruler
or rulers who keep men  deluded and drilled in readiness for acts
of violencesoldiers  and by means of them control others   and
so governments can never be brought to consent to diminish the
number of these drilled slaves  who constitute their whole power
and importance 

such is the attitude of certain learned men to the contradiction
under which our society is being crushed  and such are their
methods of solving it   tell these people that the whole matter
rests on the personal attitude of each man to the moral and
religious question put nowadays to everyone  the question  that
is  whether it is lawful or unlawful for him to take his share of
military service  and these learned gentlemen will shrug their
shoulders and not condescend to listen or to answer you   the
solution of the question in their idea is to be found in reading
addresses  writing books  electing presidents  vicepresidents 
and secretaries  and meeting and speaking first in one town and
then in another   from all this speechifying and writing it will
come to pass  according to their notions  that governments will
cease to levy the soldiers  on whom their whole strength depends 
will listen to their discourses  and will disband their forces 
leaving themselves without any defense  not only against their
neighbors  but also against their own subjects   as though a band
of brigands  who have some unarmed travelers bound and ready to be
plundered  should be so touched by their complaints of the pain
caused by the cords they are fastened with as to let them go
again 

still there are people who believe in this  busy themselves over
peace congresses  read addresses  and write books   and
governments  we may be quite sure  express their sympathy and make
a show of encouraging them   in the same way they pretend to
support temperance societies  while they are living principally on
the drunkenness of the people  and pretend to encourage education 
when their whole strength is based on ignorance  and to support
constitutional freedom  when their strength rests on the absence
of freedom  and to be anxious for the improvement of the condition
of the working classes  when their very existence depends on their
oppression  and to support christianity  when christianity
destroys all government 

to be able to do this they have long ago elaborated methods
encouraging temperance  which cannot suppress drunkenness  methods
of supporting education  which not only fail to prevent ignorance 
but even increase it  methods of aiming at freedom and
constitutionalism  which are no hindrance to despotism  methods of
protecting the working classes  which will not free them from
slavery  and a christianity  too  they have elaborated  which does
not destroy  but supports governments 

now there is something more for the government to encouragepeace  the
sovereigns  who nowadays take counsel with their ministers  decide by
their will alone whether the butchery of millions is to be begun this
year or next  they know very well that all these discourses upon peace
will not hinder them from sending millions of men to butchery when it
seems good to them  they listen even with satisfaction to these
discourses  encourage them  and take part in them 

all this  far from being detrimental  is even of service to
governments  by turning peoples attention from the most important
and pressing question ought or ought not each man called upon for
military service to submit to serve in the army 

peace will soon be arranged  thanks to alliances and congresses 
to books and pamphlets  meantime go and put on your uniform  and
prepare to cause suffering and to endure it for our benefit  is
the governments line of argument   and the learned gentlemen who
get up congresses and write articles are in perfect agreement with
it 

this is the attitude of one set of thinkers   and since it is that
most beneficial to governments  it is also the most encouraged by
all intelligent governments 

another attitude to war has something tragical in it   there are
men who maintain that the love for peace and the inevitability of
war form a hideous contradiction  and that such is the fate of
man   these are mostly gifted and sensitive men  who see and
realize all the horror and imbecility and cruelty of war  but
through some strange perversion of mind neither see nor seek to
find any way out of this position  and seem to take pleasure in
teasing the wound by dwelling on the desperate position of
humanity   a notable example of such an attitude to war is to be
found in the celebrated french writer guy de maupassant   looking
from his yacht at the drill and firing practice of the french
soldiers the following reflections occur to him

   when i think only of this word war  a kind of terror seizes
   upon me  as though i were listening to some tale of sorcery  of
   the inquisition  some long past  remote abomination  monstrous 
   unnatural 

   when cannibalism is spoken of  we smile with pride 
   proclaiming our superiority to these savages   which are the
   savages  the real savages   those who fight to eat the
   conquered  or those who fight to kill  for nothing but to kill 

   the young recruits  moving about in lines yonder  are destined
   to death like the flocks of sheep driven by the butcher along
   the road   they will fall in some plain with a saber cut in the
   head  or a bullet through the breast   and these are young men
   who might work  be productive and useful   their fathers are
   old and poor   their mothers  who have loved them for twenty
   years  worshiped them as none but mothers can  will learn in
   six months time  or a year perhaps  that their son  their boy 
   the big boy reared with so much labor  so much expense  so much
   love  has been thrown in a hole like some dead dog  after being
   disemboweled by a bullet  and trampled  crushed  to a mass of
   pulp by the charges of cavalry   why have they killed her boy 
   her handsome boy  her one hope  her pride  her life   she does
   not know  ah  why 

   war  fighting  slaughter  massacres of men   and we have now 
   in our century  with our civilization  with the spread of
   science  and the degree of philosophy which the genius of man
   is supposed to have attained  schools for training to kill  to
   kill very far off  to perfection  great numbers at once  to
   kill poor devils of innocent men with families and without any
   kind of trial 

   and what is most bewildering is that the people do not rise
   against their governments   for what difference is there
   between monarchies and republics   the most bewildering thing
   is that the whole of society is not in revolt at the word war 

   ah  we shall always live under the burden of the ancient and
   odious customs  the criminal prejudices  the ferocious ideas of
   our barbarous ancestors  for we are beasts  and beasts we shall
   remain  dominated by instinct and changed by nothing   would
   not any other man than victor hugo have been exiled for that
   mighty cry of deliverance and truth   today force is called
   violence  and is being brought to judgment  war has been put on
   its trial   at the plea of the human race  civilization
   arraigns warfare  and draws up the great list of crimes laid at
   the charge of conquerors and generals   the nations are coming
   to understand that the magnitude of a crime cannot be its
   extenuation  that if killing is a crime  killing many can be no
   extenuating circumstance  that if robbery is disgraceful 
   invasion cannot be glorious   ah  let us proclaim these
   absolute truths  let us dishonor war 

vain wrath  continues maupassant  a poets indignation   war is
held in more veneration than ever 

   a skilled proficient in that line  a slaughterer of genius 
   von moltke  in reply to the peace delegates  once uttered these
   strange words

   war is holy  war is ordained of god   it is one of the most
   sacred laws of the world   it maintains among men all the great
   and noble sentimentshonor  devotion  virtue  and courage  and
   saves them in short from falling into the most hideous
   materialism 

   so  then  bringing millions of men together into herds 
   marching by day and by night without rest  thinking of nothing 
   studying nothing  learning nothing  reading nothing  being
   useful to no one  wallowing in filth  sleeping in mud  living
   like brutes in a continual state of stupefaction  sacking
   towns  burning villages  ruining whole populations  then
   meeting another mass of human flesh  falling upon them  making
   pools of blood  and plains of flesh mixed with trodden mire and
   red with heaps of corpses  having your arms or legs carried
   off  your brains blown out for no advantage to anyone  and
   dying in some corner of a field while your old parents  your
   wife and children are perishing of hungerthat is what is
   meant by not falling into the most hideous materialism 

   warriors are the scourge of the world   we struggle against
   nature and ignorance and obstacles of all kinds to make our
   wretched life less hard   learned menbenefactors of allspend
   their lives in working  in seeking what can aid  what be
   of use  what can alleviate the lot of their fellows   they
   devote themselves unsparingly to their task of usefulness 
   making one discovery after another  enlarging the sphere of
   human intelligence  extending the bounds of science  adding
   each day some new store to the sum of knowledge  gaining each
   day prosperity  ease  strength for their country 

   war breaks out   in six months the generals have destroyed the
   work of twenty years of effort  of patience  and of genius 

   that is what is meant by not falling into the most hideous
   materialism 

   we have seen it  war   we have seen men turned to brutes 
   frenzied  killing for fun  for terror  for bravado  for
   ostentation   then when right is no more  law is dead  every
   notion of justice has disappeared   we have seen men shoot
   innocent creatures found on the road  and suspected because
   they were afraid   we have seen them kill dogs chained at their
   masters doors to try their new revolvers  we have seen them
   fire on cows lying in a field for no reason whatever  simply
   for the sake of shooting  for a joke 

   that is what is meant by not falling into the most hideous
   materialism 

   going into a country  cutting the mans throat who defends his
   house because he wears a blouse and has not a military cap on
   his head  burning the dwellings of wretched beings who have
   nothing to eat  breaking furniture and stealing goods  drinking
   the wine found in the cellars  violating the women in the
   streets  burning thousands of francs worth of powder  and
   leaving misery and cholera in ones track

   that is what is meant by not falling into the most hideous
   materialism 

   what have they done  those warriors  that proves the least
   intelligence   nothing   what have they invented   cannons and
   muskets   that is all 

   what remains to us from greece   books and statues   is greece
   great from her conquests or her creations 

   was it the invasions of the persians which saved greece from
   falling into the most hideous materialism 

   were the invasions of the barbarians what saved and
   regenerated rome 

   was it napoleon i  who carried forward the great intellectual
   movement started by the philosophers of the end of last
   century 

   yes  indeed  since government assumes the right of
   annihilating peoples thus  there is nothing surprising in the
   fact that the peoples assume the right of annihilating
   governments 

   they defend themselves   they are right   no one has an
   absolute right to govern others   it ought only to be done for
   the benefit of those who are governed   and it is as much the
   duty of anyone who governs to avoid war as it is the duty of a
   captain of a ship to avoid shipwreck 

   when a captain has let his ship come to ruin  he is judged and
   condemned  if he is found guilty of negligence or even
   incapacity 

   why should not the government be put on its trial after every
   declaration of war   if the people understood that  if they
   themselves passed judgment on murderous governments  if they
   refused to let themselves be killed for nothing  if they would
   only turn their arms against those who have given them to them
   for massacre  on that day war would be no more   but that day
   will never come footnote sur leau  pp  7180 

the author sees all the horror of war   he sees that it is caused
by governments forcing men by deception to go out to slaughter and
be slain without any advantage to themselves   and he sees  too 
that the men who make up the armies could turn their arms against
the governments and bring them to judgment   but he thinks that
that will never come to pass  and that there is  therefore  no
escape from the present position 

   i think war is terrible  but that it is inevitable  that
   compulsory military service is as inevitable as death  and that
   since government will always desire it  war will always exist 

so writes this talented and sincere writer  who is endowed with
that power of penetrating to the innermost core of the subjects
which is the essence of the poetic faculty   he brings before us
all the cruelty of the inconsistency between mens moral sense and
their actions  but without trying to remove it  seems to admit
that this inconsistency must exist and that it is the poetic
tragedy of life 

another no less gifted writer  edouard rod  paints in still more
vivid colors the cruelty and madness of the present state of
things   he too only aims at presenting its tragic features 
without suggesting or forseeing any issue from the position 

   what is the good of doing anything   what is the good of
   undertaking any enterprise   and how are we to love men in
   these troubled times when every fresh day is a menace of
   danger     all we have begun  the plans we are developing  our
   schemes of work  the little good we may have been able to do 
   will it not all be swept away by the tempest that is in
   preparation     everywhere the earth is shaking under our feet
   and stormclouds are gathering on our horizon which will have
   no pity on us 

   ah  if all we had to dread were the revolution which is held
   up as a specter to terrify us   since i cannot imagine a
   society more detestable than ours  i feel more skeptical than
   alarmed in regard to that which will replace it   if i should
   have to suffer from the change  i should be consoled by
   thinking that the executioners of that day were the victims of
   the previous time  and the hope of something better would help
   us to endure the worst   but it is not that remote peril which
   frightens me   i see another danger  nearer and far more cruel 
   more cruel because there is no excuse for it  because it is
   absurd  because it can lead to no good   every day one balances
   the chances of war on the morrow  every day they become more
   merciless 

   the imagination revolts before the catastrophe which is coming
   at the end of our century as the goal of the progress of our
   era  and yet we must get used to facing it   for twenty years
   past every resource of science has been exhausted in the
   invention of engines of destruction  and soon a few charges of
   cannon will suffice to annihilate a whole army   no longer a
   few thousands of poor devils  who were paid a price for their
   blood  are kept under arms  but whole nations are under arms to
   cut each others throats   they are robbed of their time now
   by compulsory service that they may be robbed of their lives
   later   to prepare them for the work of massacre  their hatred
   is kindled by persuading them that they are hated   and
   peaceable men let themselves be played on thus and go and fall
   on one another with the ferocity of wild beasts  furious troops
   of peaceful citizens taking up arms at an empty word of
   command  for some ridiculous question of frontiers or colonial
   trade interestsheaven only knows what    they will go like
   sheep to the slaughter  knowing all the while where they are
   going  knowing that they are leaving their wives  knowing
   that their children will want for food  full of misgivings  yet
   intoxicated by the finesounding lies that are dinned into
   their ears   they will march without revolt  passive 
   resignedthough the numbers and the strength are theirs  and
   they might  if they knew how to cooperate together  establish
   the reign of good sense and fraternity  instead of the
   barbarous trickery of diplomacy   they will march to battle so
   deluded  so duped  that they will believe slaughter to be a
   duty  and will ask the benediction of god on their lust for
   blood   they will march to battle trampling underfoot the
   harvests they have sown  burning the towns they have builtwith
   songs of triumph  festive music  and cries of jubilation 
   and their sons will raise statues to those who have done most
   in their slaughter 

   the destiny of a whole generation depends on the hour in which
   some illfated politician may give the signal that will be
   followed   we know that the best of us will be cut down and our
   work will be destroyed in embryo   we know it and tremble with
   rage  but we can do nothing   we are held fast in the toils of
   officialdom and red tape  and too rude a shock would be needed
   to set us free   we are enslaved by the laws we set up for our
   protection  which have become our oppression   we are but the
   tools of that autocratic abstraction the state  which enslaves
   each individual in the name of the will of all  who would all 
   taken individually  desire exactly the opposite of what they
   will be made to do 

   and if it were only a generation that must be sacrificed   but
   there are graver interests at stake 

   the paid politicians  the ambitious statesmen  who exploit the
   evil passions of the populace  and the imbeciles who are
   deluded by finesounding phrases  have so embittered national
   feuds that the existence of a whole race will be at stake in
   the war of the morrow  one of the elements that constitute the
   modern world is threatened  the conquered people will be wiped
   out of existence  and whichever it may be  we shall see a moral
   force annihilated  as if there were too many forces to work for
   goodwe shall have a new europe formed on foundations so
   unjust  so brutal  so sanguinary  stained with so monstrous a
   crime  that it cannot but be worse than the europe of todaymore
   iniquitous  more barbarous  more violent 

   thus one feels crushed under the weight of an immense
   discouragement   we are struggling in a cul de sac with muskets
   aimed at us from the housetops   our labor is like that of
   sailors executing their last task as the ship begins to sink 
    our pleasures are those of the condemned victim  who is
   offered his choice of dainties a quarter of an hour before his
   execution   thought is paralyzed by anguish  and the most it is
   capable of is to calculateinterpreting the vague phrases of
   ministers  spelling out the sense of the speeches of
   sovereigns  and ruminating on the words attributed to
   diplomatists reported on the uncertain authority of the

   this year or the next  that we are to be murdered   so that one
   might seek in vain in history an epoch more insecure  more

here it is pointed out that the force is in the hands of those who
work their own destruction  in the hands of the individual men who
make up the masses  it is pointed out that the source of the evil
is the government   it would seem evident that the contradiction
between life and conscience had reached the limit beyond which it
cannot go  and after reaching this limit some solution of it must
be found 

but the author does not think so   he sees in this the tragedy of
human life  and after depicting all the horror of the position he
concludes that human life must be spent in the midst of this
horror 

so much for the attitude to war of those who regard it as
something tragic and fated by destiny 

the third category consists of men who have lost all conscience
and  consequently  all common sense and feeling of humanity 

to this category belongs moltke  whose opinion has been quoted
above by maupassant  and the majority of military men  who have
been educated in this cruel superstition  live by it  and
consequently are often in all simplicity convinced that war is not
only an inevitable  but even a necessary and beneficial thing 
this is also the view of some civilians  socalled educated and
cultivated people 

here is what the celebrated academician camille doucet writes in
reply to the editor of the revue des revues  where several letters
on war were published together

   dear sir when you ask the least warlike of academicians
   whether he is a partisan of war  his answer is known
   beforehand 

   alas  sir  you yourself speak of the pacific ideal inspiring
   your generous compatriots as a dream 

   during my life i have heard a great many good people protest
   against this frightful custom of international butchery  which
   all admit and deplore  but how is it to be remedied 

   often  too  there have been attempts to suppress dueling  one
   would fancy that seemed an easy task but not at all   all that
   has been done hitherto with that noble object has never been
   and never will be of use 

   all the congresses of both hemispheres may vote against war 
   and against dueling too  but above all arbitrations 
   conventions  and legislations there will always be the personal
   honor of individual men  which has always demanded dueling  and
   the interests of nations  which will always demand war 

   i wish none the less from the depths of my heart that the
   congress of universal peace may succeed at last in its very
   honorable and difficult enterprise 

   i am  dear sir  etc  
   camille doucet 

the upshot of this is that personal honor requires men to fight 
and the interests of nations require them to ruin and exterminate
each other   as for the efforts to abolish war  they call for
nothing but a smile 

the opinion of another wellknown academician  jules claretie  is
of the same kind 

   dear sir he writes for a man of sense there can be but one
   opinion on the subject of peace and war 

   humanity is created to live  to live free  to perfect and
   ameliorate its fate by peaceful labor   the general harmony
   preached by the universal peace congress is but a dream
   perhaps  but at least it is the fairest of all dreams   man is
   always looking toward the promised land  and there the harvests
   are to ripen with no fear of their being torn up by shells or
   crushed by cannon wheels    but   ah  butsince philosophers
   and philanthropists are not the controlling powers  it is well
   for our soldiers to guard our frontier and homes  and their
   arms  skillfully used  are perhaps the surest guarantee of the
   peace we all love 

   peace is a gift only granted to the strong and the resolute 

   i am  dear sir  etc  
   jules claretie 

the upshot of this letter is that there is no harm in talking
about what no one intends or feels obliged to do   but when it
comes to practice  we must fight 

and here now is the view lately expressed by the most popular
novelist in europe  √©mile zola

   i regard war as a fatal necessity  which appears inevitable
   for us from its close connection with human nature and the
   whole constitution of the world   i should wish that war could
   be put off for the longest possible time   nevertheless  the
   moment will come when we shall be forced to go to war   i am
   considering it at this moment from the standpoint of universal
   humanity  and making no reference to our misunderstanding with
   germanya most trivial incident in the history of mankind   i
   say that war is necessary and beneficial  since it seems one of
   the conditions of existence for humanity   war confronts us
   everywhere  not only war between different races and peoples 
   but war too  in private and family life   it seems one of the
   principal elements of progress  and every step in advance that
   humanity has taken hitherto has been attended by bloodshed 

   men have talked  and still talk  of disarmament  while
   disarmament is something impossible  to which  even if it were
   possible  we ought not to consent   i am convinced that a
   general disarmament throughout the world would involve
   something like a moral decadence  which would show itself in
   general feebleness  and would hinder the progressive
   advancement of humanity   a warlike nation has always been
   strong and flourishing   the art of war has led to the
   development of all the other arts   history bears witness to
   it   so in athens and in rome  commerce  manufactures  and
   literature never attained so high a point of development as
   when those cities were masters of the whole world by force of
   arms   to take an example from times nearer our own  we may
   recall the age of louis xiv   the wars of the grand monarque
   were not only no hindrance to the progress of the arts and
   sciences  but even  on the contrary  seem to have promoted and
   favored their development 

so war is a beneficial thing 

but the best expression of this attitude is the view of the most
gifted of the writers of this school  the academician de vog√º√© 
this is what he writes in an article on the military section of
the exhibition of 1889

   on the esplanade des invalides  among the exotic and colonial
   encampments  a building in a more severe style overawes the
   picturesque bazaar  all these fragments of the globe have come
   to gather round the palace of war  and in turn our guests mount
   guard submissively before the mother building  but for whom
   they would not be here   fine subject for the antithesis of
   rhetoric  of humanitarians who could not fail to whimper over
   this juxtaposition  and to say that ceci tuera cela 
   footnote phrase quoted from victorhugo  notredame de
   paris  that the union of the nations through science and
   labor will overcome the instinct of war   let us leave them to
   cherish the chimera of a golden age  which would soon become 
   if it could be realized  an age of mud   all history teaches us
   that the one is created for the other  that blood is needed to
   hasten and cement the union of the nations   natural science
   has ratified in our day the mysterious law revealed to joseph
   de maistre by the intuition of his genius and by meditation on
   fundamental truths  he saw the world redeeming itself from
   hereditary degenerations by sacrifice  science shows it
   advancing to perfection through struggle and violent selection 
   there is the statement of the same law in both  expressed in
   different formulas   the statement is disagreeable  no doubt 
   but the laws of the world are not made for our pleasure  they
   are made for our progress   let us enter this inevitable 
   necessary palace of war  we shall be able to observe there how
   the most tenacious of our instincts  without losing any of its
   vigor  is transformed and adapted to the varying exigencies of
   historical epochs 

m  de vog√º√© finds the necessity for war  according to his views 
well expressed by the two great writers  joseph de maistre and
darwin  whose statements he likes so much that he quotes them
again 

   dear sir he writes to the editor of the revue des revues
   you ask me my view as to the possible success of the universal
   congress of peace   i hold with darwin that violent struggle is
   a law of nature which overrules all other laws  i hold with
   joseph de maistre that it is a divine law  two different ways
   of describing the same thing   if by some impossible chance a
   fraction of human societyall the civilized west  let us
   supposewere to succeed in suspending the action of this law 
   some races of stronger instincts would undertake the task of
   putting it into action against us those races would vindicate
   natures reasoning against human reason  they would be
   successful  because the certainty of peacei do not say peace 
   i say the certainty of peacewould  in half a century 
   engender a corruption and a decadence more destructive for
   mankind than the worst of wars   i believe that we must do with
   warthe criminal law of humanityas with all our criminal
   laws  that is  soften them  put them in force as rarely as
   possible  use every effort to make their application
   unnecessary   but all the experience of history teaches us that
   they cannot be altogether suppressed so long as two men are
   left on earth  with bread  money  and a woman between them 

   i should be very happy if the congress would prove me in
   error  but i doubt if it can prove history  nature  and god in
   error also 

   i am  dear sir  etc 
   e  m  de vog√º√© 

this amounts to saying that history  human nature  and god show us that
so long as there are two men  and bread  money and a womanthere will
be war  that is to say that no progress will lead men to rise above the
savage conception of life  which regards no participation of bread 
money money is good in this context and woman possible without
fighting 

they are strange people  these men who assemble in congresses  and
make speeches to show us how to catch birds by putting salt on
their tails  though they must know it is impossible to do it   and
amazing are they too  who  like maupassant  rod  and many others 
see clearly all the horror of war  all the inconsistency of men
not doing what is needful  right  and beneficial for them to do 
who lament over the tragedy of life  and do not see that the whole
tragedy is at an end directly men  ceasing to take account of any
unnecessary considerations  refuse to do what is hateful and
disastrous to them   they are amazing people truly  but those who 
like de vog√º√© and others  who  professing the doctrine of
evolution  regard war as not only inevitable  but beneficial and
therefore desirablethey are terrible  hideous  in their moral
perversion   the others  at least  say that they hate evil  and
love good  but these openly declare that good and evil do not
exist 

all discussion of the possibility of reestablishing peace instead
of everlasting waris the pernicious sentimentality of
phrasemongers   there is a law of evolution by which it follows
that i must live and act in an evil way  what is to be done   i am
an educated man  i know the law of evolution  and therefore i will
act in an evil way   entrons au palais de la guerre   there is
the law of evolution  and therefore there is neither good nor
evil  and one must live for the sake of ones personal existence 
leaving the rest to the action of the law of evolution   this is
the last word of refined culture  and with it  of that
overshadowing of conscience which has come upon the educated
classes of our times   the desire of the educated classes to
support the ideas they prefer  and the order of existence based on
them  has attained its furthest limits  they lie  and delude
themselves  and one another  with the subtlest forms of deception 
simply to obscure  to deaden conscience 

instead of transforming their life into harmony with their
conscience  they try by every means to stifle its voice   but
it is in darkness that the light begins to shine  and so the
light is rising upon our epoch 




chapter vii 

significance of compulsory service 

universal compulsory service is not a political accident  but the
furthest limit of the contradiction inherent in the social conception of
lifeorigin of authority in societybasis of authority is physical
violenceto be able to perform its acts of violence authority needs a
special organizationthe armyauthority  that is  violence  is the
principle which is destroying the social conception of lifeattitude of
authority to the masses  that is  attitude of government to working
oppressed classesgovernments try to foster in working classes the idea
that state force is necessary to defend them from external enemiesbut
the army is principally needed to preserve government from its own
subjectsthe working classesspeech of m  de capriviall privileges
of ruling classes based on violencethe increase of armies up to point
of universal serviceuniversal compulsory service destroys all the
advantages of social life  which government is intended to
preservecompulsory service is the furthest limit of submission  since
in name of the state it requires sacrifice of all that can be precious
to a manis government necessary the sacrifices demanded by
government in compulsory service have no longer any reasonable
basisand there is more advantage to be gained by not submitting to the
demands of the state than by submitting to them 


educated people of the upper classes are trying to stifle the
evergrowing sense of the necessity of transforming the existing
social order   but life  which goes on growing more complex  and
developing in the same direction  and increases the
inconsistencies and the sufferings of men  brings them to the
limit beyond which they cannot go   this furthest limit of
inconsistency is universal compulsory military service 

it is usually supposed that universal military service and the
increased armaments connected with it  as well as the resulting
increase of taxes and national debts  are a passing phenomenon 
produced by the particular political situation of europe  and that
it may be removed by certain political combinations without any
modification of the inner order of life 

this is absolutely incorrect   universal military service is only
the internal inconsistency inherent in the social conception of
life  carried to its furthest limits  and becoming evident when a
certain stage of material development is reached 

the social conception of life  we have seen  consists in the
transfer of the aim of life from the individual to groups and
their maintenanceto the tribe  family  race  or state 

in the social conception of life it is supposed that since the aim
of life is found in groups of individuals  individuals will
voluntarily sacrifice their own interests for the interests of the
group   and so it has been  and still is  in fact  in certain
groups  the distinction being that they are the most primitive
forms of association in the family or tribe or race  or even in
the patriarchal state   through tradition handed down by education
and supported by religious sentiment  individuals without
compulsion merged their interests in the interest of the group and
sacrificed their own good for the general welfare 

but the more complex and the larger societies become  and
especially the more often conquest becomes the cause of the
amalgamation of people into a state  the more often individuals
strive to attain their own aims at the public expense  and the
more often it becomes necessary to restrain these insubordinate
individuals by recourse to authority  that is  to violence   the
champions of the social conception of life usually try to connect
the idea of authority  that is  of violence  with the idea of
moral influence  but this connection is quite impossible 

the effect of moral influence on a man is to change his desires
and to bend them in the direction of the duty required of him 
the man who is controlled by moral influence acts in accordance
with his own desires   authority  in the sense in which the word
is ordinarily understood  is a means of forcing a man to act in
opposition to his desires   the man who submits to authority does
not do as he chooses but as he is obliged by authority   nothing
can oblige a man to do what he does not choose except physical
force  or the threat of it  that isdeprivation of freedom 
blows  imprisonment  or threatseasily carried outof such
punishments   this is what authority consists of and always has
consisted of 

in spite of the unceasing efforts of those who happen to be in authority
to conceal this and attribute some other significance to it  authority
has always meant for man the cord  the chain with which he is bound and
fettered  or the knout with which he is to be flogged  or the ax with
which he is to have hands  ears  nose  or head cut off  or at the very
least  the threat of these terrors  so it was under nero and ghenghis
khan  and so it is today  even under the most liberal government in the
republics of the united states or of france  if men submit to authority 
it is only because they are liable to these punishments in case of
nonsubmission  all state obligations  payment of taxes  fulfillment of
state duties  and submission to punishments  exile  fines  etc   to
which people appear to submit voluntarily  are always based on bodily
violence or the threat of it 

the basis of authority is bodily violence  the possibility of
applying bodily violence to people is provided above all by an
organization of armed men  trained to act in unison in submission
to one will   these bands of armed men  submissive to a single
will  are what constitute the army   the army has always been and
still is the basis of power   power is always in the hands of
those who control the army  and all men in powerfrom the roman
caesars to the russian and german emperorstake more interest in
their army than in anything  and court popularity in the army 
knowing that if that is on their side their power is secure 

the formation and aggrandizement of the army  indispensable to the
maintenance of authority  is what has introduced into the social
conception of life the principle that is destroying it 

the object of authority and the justification for its existence
lie in the restraint of those who aim at attaining their personal
interests to the detriment of the interests of society 

but however power has been gained  those who possess it are in no
way different from other men  and therefore no more disposed than
others to subordinate their own interests to those of the society 
on the contrary  having the power to do so at their disposal  they
are more disposed than others to subordinate the public interests
to their own   whatever means men have devised for preventing
those in authority from overriding public interests for their own
benefit  or for intrusting power only to the most faultless
people  they have not so far succeeded in either of those aims 

all the methods of appointing authorities that have been tried 
divine right  and election  and heredity  and balloting  and
assemblies and parliaments and senatehave all proved
ineffectual   everyone knows that not one of these methods attains
the aim either of intrusting power only to the incorruptible  or
of preventing power from being abused   everyone knows on the
contrary that men in authoritybe they emperors  ministers 
governors  or police officersare always  simply from the
possession of power  more liable to be demoralized  that is  to
subordinate public interests to their personal aims than those who
have not the power to do so   indeed  it could not be otherwise 

the state conception of life could be justified only so long as
all men voluntarily sacrificed their personal interests to the
public welfare   but so soon as there were individuals who would
not voluntarily sacrifice their own interests  and authority  that
is  violence  was needed to restrain them  then the disintegrating
principle of the coercion of one set of people by another set
entered into the social conception of the organization based on
it 

for the authority of one set of men over another to attain its
object of restraining those who override public interests for
their personal ends  power ought only to be put into the hands of
the impeccable  as it is supposed to be among the chinese  and as
it was supposed to be in the middle ages  and is even now supposed
to be by those who believe in the consecration by anointing   only
under those conditions could the social organization be justified 

but since this is not the case  and on the contrary men in power
are always far from being saints  through the very fact of their
possession of power  the social organization based on power has no
justification 

even if there was once a time when  owing to the low standard of
morals  and the disposition of men to violence  the existence of
an authority to restrain such violence was an advantage  because
the violence of government was less than the violence of
individuals  one cannot but see that this advantage could not be
lasting   as the disposition of individuals to violence
diminished  and as the habits of the people became more civilized 
and as power grew more social organization demoralized through
lack of restraint  this advantage disappeared 

the whole history of the last two thousand years is nothing but
the history of this gradual change of relation between the moral
development of the masses on the one hand and the demoralization
of governments on the other 

this  put simply  is how it has come to pass 

men lived in families  tribes  and races  at feud with one
another  plundering  outraging  and killing one another   these
violent hostilities were carried on on a large and on a small
scale man against man  family against family  tribe against
tribe  race against race  and people against people   the larger
and stronger groups conquered and absorbed the weaker  and the
larger and stronger they became  the more internal feuds
disappeared and the more the continuity of the group seemed
assured 

the members of a family or tribe  united into one community  are
less hostile among themselves  and families and tribes do not die
like one man  but have a continuity of existence   between the
members of one state  subject to a single authority  the strife
between individuals seems still less and the life of the state
seems even more secure 

their association into larger and larger groups was not the result
of the conscious recognition of the benefits of such associations 
as it is said to be in the story of the varyagi   it was produced 
on one hand  by the natural growth of population  and  on the
other  by struggle and conquest 

after conquest the power of the emperor puts an end to internal
dissensions  and so the state conception of life justifies itself 
but this justification is never more than temporary   internal
dissensions disappear only in proportion to the degree of
oppression exerted by the authority over the dissentient
individuals   the violence of internal feud crushed by authority
reappears in authority itself  which falls into the hands of men
who  like the rest  are frequently or always ready to sacrifice
the public welfare to their personal interest  with the difference
that their subjects cannot resist them  and thus they are exposed
to all the demoralizing influence of authority   and thus the evil
of violence  when it passes into the hands of authority  is always
growing and growing  and in time becomes greater than the evil it
is supposed to suppress  while  at the same time  the tendency to
violence in the members of the society becomes weaker and weaker 
so that the violence of authority is less and less needed 

government authority  even if it does suppress private violence 
always introduces into the life of men fresh forms of violence 
which tend to become greater and greater in proportion to the
duration and strength of the government 

so that though the violence of power is less noticeable in
government than when it is employed by members of society against
one another  because it finds expression in submission  and not in
strife  it nevertheless exists  and often to a greater degree than
in former days 

and it could not be otherwise  since  apart from the demoralizing
influence of power  the policy or even the unconscious tendency of
those in power will always be to reduce their subjects to the
extreme of weakness  for the weaker the oppressed  the less effort
need be made to keep him in subjection 

and therefore the oppression of the oppressed always goes on
growing up to the furthest limit  beyond which it cannot go
without killing the goose with the golden eggs   and if the goose
lays no more eggs  like the american indians  negroes  and
fijians  then it is killed in spite of the sincere protests of
philanthropists 

the most convincing example of this is to be found in the
condition of the working classes of our epoch  who are in reality
no better than the slaves of ancient times subdued by conquest 

in spite of the pretended efforts of the higher classes to
ameliorate the position of the workers  all the working classes of
the present day are kept down by the inflexible iron law by which
they only get just what is barely necessary  so that they are
forced to work without ceasing while still retaining strength
enough to labor for their employers  who are really those who have
conquered and enslaved them 

so it has always been   in ratio to the duration and increasing
strength of authority its advantages for its subjects disappear
and its disadvantages increase 

and this has been so  independently of the forms of government
under which nations have lived  the only difference is that under
a despotic form of government the authority is concentrated in a
small number of oppressors and violence takes a cruder form  under
constitutional monarchies and republics as in france and america
authority is divided among a great number of oppressors and the
forms assumed by violence is less crude  but its effect of making
the disadvantages of authority greater than its advantages  and of
enfeebling the oppressed to the furthest extreme to which they can
be reduced with advantage to the oppressors  remains always the
same 

such has been and still is the condition of all the oppressed  but
hitherto they have not recognized the fact  in the majority of instances
they have believed in all simplicity that governments exist for their
benefit  that they would be lost without a government  that the very
idea of living without a government is a blasphemy which one hardly dare
put into words  that this is thefor some reason terribledoctrine of
anarchism  with which a mental picture of all kinds of horrors is
associated 

people have believed  as though it were something fully proved 
and so needing no proof  that since all nations have hitherto
developed in the form of states  that form of organization is an
indispensable condition of the development of humanity 

and in that way it has lasted for hundreds and thousands of years 
and governmentsthose who happened to be in powerhave tried it 
and are now trying more zealously than ever to keep their subjects
in this error 

so it was under the roman emperors and so it is now   in spite of
the fact that the sense of the uselessness and even injurious
effects of state violence is more and more penetrating into mens
consciousness  things might have gone on in the same way forever
if governments were not under the necessity of constantly
increasing their armies in order to maintain their power 

it is generally supposed that governments strengthen their forces
only to defend the state from other states  in oblivion of the
fact that armies are necessary  before all things  for the defense
of governments from their own oppressed and enslaved subjects 

that has always been necessary  and has become more and more
necessary with the increased diffusion of education among the
masses  with the improved communication between people of the same
and of different nationalities   it has become particularly
indispensable now in the face of communism  socialism  anarchism 
and the labor movement generally   governments feel that it is so 
and strengthen the force of their disciplined armies  see
footnote

    footnote the fact that in america the abuses of
    authority exist in spite of the small number of their
    troops not only fails to disprove this position 
    but positively confirms it   in america there are
    fewer soldiers than in other states   that is why
    there is nowhere else so little oppression of the
    working classes  and no country where the end of the
    abuses of government and of government itself seems
    so near   of late as the combinations of laborers
    gain in strength  one hears more and more frequently
    the cry raised for the increase of the army  though
    the united states are not threatened with any attack
    from without   the upper classes know that an army of
    fifty thousand will soon be insufficient  and no longer
    relying on pinkertons men  they feel that the security
    of their position depends on the increased strength of
    the army 


in the german reichstag not long ago  in reply to a question why funds
were needed for raising the salaries of the underofficers  the german
chancellor openly declared that trustworthy underofficers were
necessary to contend against socialism  caprivi only said aloud what
every statesman knows and assiduously conceals from the people  the
reason to which he gave expression is essentially the same as that which
made the french kings and the popes engage swiss and scotch guards  and
makes the russian authorities of today so carefully distribute the
recruits  so that the regiments from the frontiers are stationed in
central districts  and the regiments from the center are stationed on
the frontiers  the meaning of caprivis speech  put into plain language 
is that funds are needed  not to resist foreign foes  but to buy
underofficers to be ready to act against the enslaved toiling masses 

caprivi incautiously gave utterance to what everyone knows
perfectly well  or at least feels vaguely if he does not recognize
it  that is  that the existing order of life is as it is  not  as
would be natural and right  because the people wish it to be so 
but because it is so maintained by state violence  by the army
with its bought underofficers and generals 

if the laborer has no land  if he cannot use the natural right of
every man to derive subsistence for himself and his family out of
the land  that is not because the people wish it to be so  but
because a certain set of men  the landowners  have appropriated
the right of giving or refusing admittance to the land to the
laborers   and this abnormal order of things is maintained by the
army   if the immense wealth produced by the labor of the working
classes is not regarded as the property of all  but as the
property of a few exceptional persons  if labor is taxed by
authority and the taxes spent by a few on what they think fit  if
strikes on the part of laborers are repressesd  while on the part
of capitalists they are encouraged  if certain persons appropriate
the right of choosing the form of the education  religious and
secular  of children  and certain persons monopolize the right of
making the laws all must obey  and so dispose of the lives and
properties of other peopleall this is not done because the
people wish it and because it is what is natural and right  but
because the government and ruling classes wish this to be so for
their own benefit  and insist on its being so even by physical
violence 

everyone  if he does not recognize this now  will know that it is
so at the first attempt at insubordination or at a revolution of
the existing order 

armies  then  are needed by governments and by the ruling classes
above all to support the present order  which  far from being the
result of the peoples needs  is often in direct antagonism to
them  and is only beneficial to the government and ruling classes 

to keep their subjects in oppression and to be able to enjoy the
fruits of their labor the government must have armed forces 

but there is not only one government   there are other
governments  exploiting their subjects by violence in the same
way  and always ready to pounce down on any other government and
carry off the fruits of the toil of its enslaved subjects   and so
every government needs an army also to protect its booty from its
neighbor brigands   every government is thus involuntarily reduced
to the necessity of emulating one another in the increase of their
armies   this increase is contagious  as montesquieu pointed out
150 years ago 

every increase in the army of one state  with the aim of
selfdefense against its subjects  becomes a source of danger for
neighboring states and calls for a similar increase in their
armies 

the armed forces have reached their present number of millions not
only through the menace of danger from neighboring states  but
principally through the necessity of subduing every effort at
revolt on the part of the subjects 

both causes  mutually dependent  contribute to the same result at
once  troops are required against internal forces and also to keep
up a position with other states   one is the result of the other 
the despotism of a government always increases with the strength
of the army and its external successes  and the aggressiveness of
a government increases with its internal despotism 

the rivalry of the european states in constantly increasing their
forces has reduced them to the necessity of having recourse to
universal military service  since by that means the greatest
possible number of soldiers is obtained at the least possible
expense   germany first hit on this device   and directly one
state adopted it the others were obliged to do the same   and by
this means all citizens are under arms to support the iniquities
practiced upon them  all citizens have become their own
oppressors 

universal military service was an inevitable logical necessity  to
which we were bound to come   but it is also the last expression
of the inconsistency inherent in the social conception of life 
when violence is needed to maintain it   this inconsistency has
become obvious in universal military service   in fact  the whole
significance of the social conception of life consists in mans
recognition of the barbarity of strife between individuals  and
the transitoriness of personal life itself  and the transference
of the aim of life to groups of persons   but with universal
military service it comes to pass that men  after making every
sacrifice to get rid of the cruelty of strife and the insecurity
of existence  are called upon to face all the perils they had
meant to avoid   and in addition to this the state  for whose sake
individuals renounced their personal advantages  is exposed again
to the same risks of insecurity and lack of permanence as the
individual himself was in previous times 

governments were to give men freedom from the cruelty of personal
strife and security in the permanence of the state order of
existence   but instead of doing that they expose the individuals
to the same necessity of strife  substituting strife with
individuals of other states for strife with neighbors   and the
danger of destruction for the individual  and the state too  they
leave just as it was 

universal military service may be compared to the efforts of a man
to prop up his falling house who so surrounds it and fills it with
props and buttresses and planks and scaffolding that he manages to
keep the house standing only by making it impossible to live in
it 

in the same way universal military service destroys all the
benefits of the social order of life which it is employed to
maintain 

the advantages of social organization are security of property and labor
and associated action for the improvement of existenceuniversal
military service destroys all this 

the taxes raised from the people for war preparations absorb the greater
part of the produce of labor which the army ought to defend 

the withdrawing of all men from the ordinary course of life
destroys the possibility of labor itself  the danger of war  ever
ready to break out  renders all reforms of life social life vain
and fruitless 

in former days if a man were told that if he did not acknowledge
the authority of the state  he would be exposed to attack from
enemies domestic and foreign  that he would have to resist them
alone  and would be liable to be killed  and that therefore it
would be to his advantage to put up with some hardships to secure
himself from these calamities  he might well believe it  seeing
that the sacrifices he made to the state were only partial and
gave him the hope of a tranquil existence in a permanent state 
but now  when the sacrifices have been increased tenfold and
the promised advantages are disappearing  it would be a natural
reflection that submission to authority is absolutely useless 

but the fatal significance of universal military service  as the
manifestation of the contradiction inherent in the social
conception of life  is not only apparent in that   the greatest
manifestation of this contradiction consists in the fact that
every citizen in being made a soldier becomes a prop of the
government organization  and shares the responsibility of
everything the government does  even though he may not admit its
legitimacy 

governments assert that armies are needed above all for external
defense  but that is not true   they are needed principally
against their subjects  and every man  under universal military
service  becomes an accomplice in all the acts of violence of the
government against the citizens without any choice of his own 

to convince oneself of this one need only remember what things are
done in every state  in the name of order and the public welfare 
of which the execution always falls to the army   all civil
outbreaks for dynastic or other party reasons  all the executions
that follow on such disturbances  all repression of insurrections 
and military intervention to break up meetings and to suppress
strikes  all forced extortion of taxes  all the iniquitous
distributions of land  all the restrictions on laborare either
carried out directly by the military or by the police with the
army at their back   anyone who serves his time in the army shares
the responsibility of all these things  about which he is  in some
cases  dubious  while very often they are directly opposed to his
conscience   people are unwilling to be turned out of the land
they have cultivated for generations  or they are unwilling to
disperse when the government authority orders them  or they are
unwilling to pay the taxes required of them  or to recognize laws
as binding on them when they have had no hand in making them  or
to be deprived of their nationalityand i  in the fulfillment of
my military duty  must go and shoot them for it   how can i help
asking myself when i take part in such punishments  whether they
are just  and whether i ought to assist in carrying them out 

universal service is the extreme limit of violence necessary for
the support of the whole state organization  and it is the extreme
limit to which submission on the part of the subjects can go   it
is the keystone of the whole edifice  and its fall will bring it
all down 

the time has come when the evergrowing abuse of power by governments
and their struggles with one another has led to their demanding such
material and even moral sacrifices from their subjects that everyone is
forced to reflect and ask himself  can i make these sacrifices  and for
the sake of what am i making them  i am expected for the sake of the
state to make these sacrifices  to renounce everything that can be
precious to manpeace  family  security  and human dignity  what is
this state  for whose sake such terrible sacrifices have to be made  and
why is it so indispensably necessary  the state  they tell us  is
indispensably needed  in the first place  because without it we should
not be protected against the attacks of evildisposed persons  and
secondly  except for the state we should be savages and should have
neither religion  culture  education  nor commerce  nor means of
communication  nor other social institutions  and thirdly  without the
state to defend us we should be liable to be conquered and enslaved by
neighboring peoples 

except for the state  they say  we should be exposed to the
attacks of evildisposed persons in our own country 

but who are these evildisposed persons in our midst from whose attacks
we are preserved by the state and its army  even if  three or four
centuries ago  when men prided themselves on their warlike prowess  when
killing men was considered an heroic achievement  there were such
persons  we know very well that there are no such persons now  that we
do not nowadays carry or use firearms  but everyone professes humane
principles and feels sympathy for his fellows  and wants nothing more
than we all dothat is  to be left in peace to enjoy his existence
undisturbed  so that nowadays there are no special malefactors from whom
the state could defend us  if by these evil disposed persons is meant
the men who are punished as criminals  we know very well that they are
not a different kind of being like wild beasts among sheep  but are men
just like ourselves  and no more naturally inclined to crimes than those
against whom they commit them  we know now that threats and punishments
cannot diminish their number  that that can only be done by change of
environment and moral influence  so that the justification of state
violence on the ground of the protection it gives us from evildisposed
persons  even if it had some foundation three or four centuries ago  has
none whatever now  at present one would rather say on the contrary that
the action of the state with its cruel methods of punishment  behind the
general moral standard of the age  such as prisons  galleys  gibbets 
and guillotines  tends rather to brutalize the people than to civilize
them  and consequently rather to increase than diminish the number of
malefactors 

except for the state  they tell us  we should not have any
religion  education  culture  means of communication  and so on 
without the state men would not have been able to form the social
institutions needed for doing any thing   this argument too was
well founded only some centuries ago 

if there was a time when people were so disunited  when they had
so little means of communication and interchange of ideas  that
they could not cooperate and agree together in any common action
in commerce  economics  or education without the state as a
center  this want of common action exists no longer   the great
extension of means of communication and interchange of ideas has
made men completely able to dispense with state aid in forming
societies  associations  corporations  and congresses for
scientific  economic  and political objects   indeed government is
more often an obstacle than an assistance in attaining these aims 

from the end of last century there has hardly been a single
progressive movement of humanity which has not been retarded by
the government   so it has been with abolition of corporal
punishment  of trial by torture  and of slavery  as well as with
the establishment of the liberty of the press and the right of
public meeting   in our day governments not only fail to
encourage  but directly hinder every movement by which people try
to work out new forms of life for themselves   every attempt at
the solution of the problems of labor  land  politics  and
religion meets with direct opposition on the part of government 

without governments nations would be enslaved by their
neighbors   it is scarcely necessary to refute this last
argument   it carries its refutation on the face of it   the
government  they tell us  with its army  is necessary to defend us
from neighboring states who might enslave us   but we know this is
what all governments say of one another  and yet we know that all
the european nations profess the same principles of liberty and
fraternity  and therefore stand in no need of protection against
one another   and if defense against barbarous nations is meant 
onethousandth part of the troops now under arms would be amply
sufficient for that purpose   we see that it is really the very
opposite of what we have been told   the power of the state  far
from being a security against the attacks of our neighbors 
exposes us  on the contrary  to much greater danger of such
attacks   so that every man who is led  through his compulsory
service in the army  to reflect on the value of the state for
whose sake he is expected to be ready to sacrifice his peace 
security  and life  cannot fail to perceive that there is no kind
of justification in modern times for such a sacrifice 

and it is not only from the theoretical standpoint that every man
must see that the sacrifices demanded by the state have no
justification   even looking at it practically  weighing  that is
to say  all the burdens laid on him by the state  no man can fail
to see that for him personally to comply with state demands and
serve in the army  would  in the majority of cases  be more
disadvantageous than to refuse to do so 

if the majority of men choose to submit rather than to refuse  it
is not the result of sober balancing of advantages and
disadvantages  but because they are induced by a kind of
hypnotizing process practiced upon them   in submitting they
simply yield to the suggestions given them as orders  without
thought or effort of will   to resist would need independent
thought and effort of which every man is not capable   even apart
from the moral significance of compliance or noncompliance 
considering material advantage only  noncompliance will be more
advantageous in general 

whoever i may be  whether i belong to the welltodo class of the
oppressors  or the working class of the oppressed  in either case
the disadvantages of noncompliance are less and its advantages
greater than those of compliance   if i belong to the minority of
oppressors the disadvantages of noncompliance will consist in my
being brought to judgment for refusing to perform my duties to the
state  and if i am lucky  being acquitted or  as is done in the
case of the mennonites in russia  being set to work out my
military service at some civil occupation for the state  while if
i am unlucky  i may be condemned to exile or imprisonment for two
or three years i judge by the cases that have occurred in
russia  possibly to even longer imprisonment  or possibly to
death  though the probability of that latter is very remote 

so much for the disadvantages of noncompliance   the
disadvantages of compliance will be as follows if i am lucky i
shall not be sent to murder my fellowcreatures  and shall not be
exposed to great danger of being maimed and killed  but shall only
be enrolled into military slavery   i shall be dressed up like a
clown  i shall be at the beck and call of every man of a higher
grade than my own from corporal to fieldmarshal  shall be put
through any bodily contortions at their pleasure  and after being
kept from one to five years i shall have for ten years afterward
to be in readiness to undertake all of it again at any minute   if
i am unlucky i may  in addition  be sent to war  where i shall be
forced to kill men of foreign nations who have done me no harm 
where i may be maimed or killed  or sent to certain destruction as
in the case of the garrison of sevastopol  and other cases in
every war  or what would be most terrible of all  i may be sent
against my own compatriots and have to kill my own brothers for
some dynastic or other state interests which have absolutely
nothing to do with me   so much for the comparative disadvantages 

the comparative advantages of compliance and noncompliance are as
follows

for the man who submits  the advantages will be that  after
exposing himself to all the humiliation and performing all the
barbarities required of him  he may  if he escapes being killed 
get a decoration of red or gold tinsel to stick on his clowns
dress  he may  if he is very lucky  be put in command of hundreds
of thousands of others as brutalized as himself  be called a
fieldmarshal  and get a lot of money 

the advantages of the man who refuses to obey will consist in
preserving his dignity as a man  gaining the approbation of good
men  and above all knowing that he is doing the work of god  and
so undoubtedly doing good to his fellowmen 

so much for the advantages and disadvantages of both lines of
conduct for a man of the wealthy classes  an oppressor   for a man
of the poor working class the advantages and disadvantages will be
the same  but with a great increase of disadvantages   the
disadvantages for the poor man who submits will be aggravated by
the fact that he will by taking part in it  and  as it were 
assenting to it strengthen the state of subjection in which he is
held himself 

but no considerations as to how far the state is useful or
beneficial to the men who help to support it by serving in the
army  nor of the advantages or disadvantages for the individual of
compliance or noncompliance with state demands  will decide the
question of the continued existence or the abolition of
government   this question will be finally decided beyond appeal
by the religious consciousness or conscience of every man who is
forced  whether he will or no  through universal conscription  to
face the question whether the state is to continue to exist or
not 




chapter viii 

doctrine of nonresistance to evil by force must inevitably be
accepted by men of the present day 

christianity is not a system of rules  but a new conception of
life  and therefore it was not obligatory and was not accepted
in its true significance by all  but only by a fewchristianity
is  moreover  prophetic of the destruction of the pagan life 
and therefore of necessity of the acceptance of the christian
doctrinesnonresistance of evil by force is one aspect of the
christian doctrine  which must inevitably in our times be
accepted by mentwo methods of deciding every quarrelfirst
method is to find a universal definition of evil  which all must
accept  and to resist this evil by forcesecond method is the
christian one of complete nonresistance by forcethough the
failure of the first method was recognized since the early days of
christianity  it was still proposed  and only as mankind has
progressed it has become more and more evident that there cannot
be any universal definition of evilthis is recognized by all at
the present day  and if force is still used to resist evil  it is
not because it is now regarded as right  but because people dont
know how to avoid itthe difficulty of avoiding it is the result
of the subtle and complex character of the government use of
forceforce is used in four ways intimidation  bribery 
hypnotism  and coercion by force of armsstate violence can never
be suppressed by the forcible overthrow of the governmentmen are
led by the sufferings of the pagan mode of life to the necessity
of accepting christs teaching with its doctrine of nonresistance
by forcethe consciousness of its truth which is diffused
throughout our society  will also bring about its acceptancethis
consciousness is in complete contradiction with our lifethis is
specially obvious in compulsory military service  but through
habit and the application of the four methods of violence by the
state  men do not see this inconsistency of christianity with life
of a soldierthey do not even see it  though the authorities
themselves show all the immorality of a soldiers duties with
perfect clearnessthe call to military service is the supreme
test for every man  when the choice is offered him  between
adopting the christian doctrine of nonresistance  or slavishly
submitting to the existing state organizationmen usually
renounce all they hold sacred  and submit to the demands of
government  seeming to see no other course open to themfor men
of the pagan conception of life there is no other course open  and
never will be  in spite of the growing horrors of warsociety 
made up of such men  must perish  and no social reorganization can
save itpagan life has reached its extreme limit  and will
annihilate itself 


it is often said that if christianity is a truth  it ought to have
been accepted by everyone directly it appeared  and ought to have
transformed mens lives for the better   but this is like saying
that if the seed were ripe it ought at once to bring forth stalls 
flower  and fruit 

the christian religion is not a legal system which  being imposed
by violence  may transform mens lives   christianity is a new and
higher conception of life   a new conception of life cannot be
imposed on men  it can only be freely assimilated   and it can
only be freely assimilated in two ways one spiritual and
internal  the other experimental and external 

some peoplea minorityby a kind of prophetic instinct divine
the truth of the doctrine  surrender themselves to it and adopt
it   othersthe majorityonly through a long course of mistakes 
experiments  and suffering are brought to recognize the truth of
the doctrine and the necessity of adopting it 

and by this experimental external method the majority of christian
men have now been brought to this necessity of assimilating the
doctrine   one sometimes wonders what necessitated the corruption
of christianity which is now the greatest obstacle to its
acceptance in its true significance 

if christianity had been presented to men in its true  uncorrupted
form  it would not have been accepted by the majority  who would
have been as untouched by it as the nations of asia are now   the
peoples who accepted it in its corrupt form were subjected to its
slow but certain influence  and by a long course of errors and
experiments and their resultant sufferings have now been brought
to the necessity of assimilating it in its true significance 

the corruption of christianity and its acceptance in its corrupt
form by the majority of men was as necessary as it is that the
seed should remain hidden for a certain time in the earth in order
to germinate 

christianity is at once a doctrine of truth and a prophecy 
eighteen centuries ago christianity revealed to men the truth in
which they ought to live  and at the same time foretold what human
life would become if men would not live by it but continued to
live by their previous principles  and what it would become if
they accepted the christian doctrine and carried it out in their
lives 

laying down in the sermon on the mount the principles by which to
guide mens lives  christ said whosoever heareth these sayings
of mine  and doeth them  i will liken him unto a wise man  who
built his house upon a rock  and the rain descended  and the
floods came  and the winds blew  and beat upon that house  and it
fell not  for it was founded upon a rock   and everyone that
heareth these sayings  and doeth them not  shall be likened unto a
foolish man  who built his house upon the sand  and the rain
descended  and the floods came  and the winds blew  and beat upon
that house  and it fell and great was the fall of it matt  vii 
2427 

and now after eighteen centuries the prophecy has been fulfilled 
not having followed christs teaching generally and its
application to social life in nonresistance to evil  men have
been brought in spite of themselves to the inevitable destruction
foretold by christ for those who do not fulfill his teaching 

people often think the question of nonresistance to evil by force
is a theoretical one  which can be neglected   yet this question
is presented by life itself to all men  and calls for some answer
from every thinking man   ever since christianity has been
outwardly professed  this question is for men in their social life
like the question which presents itself to a traveler when the
road on which he has been journeying divides into two branches 
he must go on and he cannot say i will not think about it  but
will go on just as i did before   there was one road  now there
are two  and he must make his choice 

in the same way since christs teaching has been known by men they
cannot say i will live as before and will not decide the question
of resistance or nonresistance to evil by force   at every new
struggle that arises one must inevitably decide  am i  or am i
not  to resist by force what i regard as evil 

the question of resistance or nonresistance to evil arose when
the first conflict between men took place  since every conflict is
nothing else than resistance by force to what each of the
combatants regards as evil   but before christ  men did not see
that resistance by force to what each regards as evil  simply
because one thinks evil what the other thinks good  is only one of
the methods of settling the dispute  and that there is another
method  that of not resisting evil by force at all 

before christs teaching  it seemed to men that the one only means
of settling a dispute was by resistance to evil by force   and
they acted accordingly  each of the combatants trying to convince
himself and others that what each respectively regards as evil  is
actually  absolutely evil 

and to do this from the earliest time men have devised definitions
of evil and tried to make them binding on everyone   and such
definitions of evil sometimes took the form of laws  supposed to
have been received by supernatural means  sometimes of the
commands of rulers or assemblies to whom infallibility was
attributed   men resorted to violence against others  and
convinced themselves and others that they were directing their
violence against evil recognized as such by all 

this means was employed from the earliest times  especially by
those who had gained possession of authority  and for a long while
its irrationality was not detected 

but the longer men lived in the world and the more complex their
relations became  the more evident it was that to resist by force
what each regarded as evil was irrational  that conflict was in no
way lessened thereby  and that no human definitions can succeed in
making what some regard as evil be accepted as such by others 

already at the time christianity arose  it was evident to a great
number of people in the roman empire where it arose  that what was
regarded as evil by nero and caligula could not be regarded as
evil by others   even at that time men had begun to understand
that human laws  though given out for divine laws  were compiled
by men  and cannot be infallible  whatever the external majesty
with which they are invested  and that erring men are not rendered
infallible by assembling together and calling themselves a senate
or any other name   even at that time this was felt and understood
by many   and it was then that christ preached his doctrine  which
consisted not only of the prohibition of resistance to evil by
force  but gave a new conception of life and a means of putting an
end to conflict between all men  not by making it the duty of one
section only of mankind to submit without conflict to what is
prescribed to them by certain authorities  but by making it the
duty of alland consequently of those in authoritynot to resort
to force against anyone in any circumstances 

this doctrine was accepted at the time by only a very small number
of disciples   the majority of men  especially all who were in
power  even after the nominal acceptance of christianity 
continued to maintain for themselves the principle of resistance
by force to what they regarded as evil   so it was under the roman
and byzantine emperors  and so it continued to be later 

the insufficiency of the principle of the authoritative definition
of evil and resistance to it by force  evident as it was in the
early ages of christianity  becomes still more obvious through the
division of the roman empire into many states of equal authority 
through their hostilities and the internal conflicts that broke
out within them 

but men were not ready to accept the solution given by christ  and
the old definitions of evil  which ought to be resisted  continued
to be laid down by means of making laws binding on all and
enforced by forcible means   the authority who decided what ought
to be regarded as evil and resisted by force was at one time the
pope  at another an emperor or king  an elective assembly or a
whole nation   but both within and without the state there were
always men to be found who did not accept as binding on themselves
the laws given out as the decrees of a god  or made by men
invested with a sacred character  or the institutions supposed to
represent the will of the nation  and there were men who thought
good what the existing authorities regarded as bad  and who
struggled against the authorities with the same violence as was
employed against them 

the men invested with religious authority regarded as evil what
the men and institutions invested with temporal authority regarded
as good and vice versa  and the struggle grew more and more
intense   and the longer men used violence as the means of
settling their disputes  the more obvious it became that it was an
unsuitable means  since there could be no external authority able
to define evil recognized by all 

things went on like this for eighteen centuries  and at last
reached the present position in which it is absolutely obvious
that there is  and can be  no external definition of evil binding
upon all   men have come to the point of ceasing to believe in the
possibility or even desirability of finding and establishing such
a general definition   it has come to men in power ceasing to
attempt to prove that what they regard as evil is evil  and simply
declaring that they regard as evil what they dont like  while
their subjects no longer obey them because they accept the
definition of evil laid down by them  but simply obey because they
cannot help themselves   it was not because it was a good thing 
necessary and beneficial to men  and the contrary course would
have been an evil  but simply because it was the will of those in
power that nice was incorporated into france  and lorraine into
germany  and bohemia into austria  and that poland was divided 
and ireland and india ruled by the english government  and that
the chinese are attacked and the africans slaughtered  and the
chinese prevented from immigrating by the americans  and the jews
persecuted by the russians  and that landowners appropriate lands
they do not cultivate and capitalists enjoy the fruits of the
labor of others   it has come to the present state of things  one
set of men commit acts of violence no longer on the pretext of
resistance to evil  but simply for their profit or their caprice 
and another set submit to violence  not because they suppose  as
was supposed in former times  that this violence was practised
upon them for the sake of securing them from evil  but simply
because they cannot avoid it 

if the roman  or the man of mediaeval times  or the average
russian of fifty years ago  as i remember him  was convinced
without a shade of doubt that the violence of authority was
indispensable to preserve him from evil  that taxes  dues 
serfage  prisons  scourging  knouts  executions  the army and war
were what ought to bewe know now that one can seldom find a man
who believes that all these means of violence preserve anyone from
any evil whatever  and indeed does not clearly perceive that most
of these acts of violence to which he is exposed  and in which he
has some share  are in themselves a great and useless evil 

there is no one today who does not see the uselessness and injustice of
collecting taxes from the toiling masses to enrich idle officials  or
the senselessness of inflicting punishments on weak or depraved persons
in the shape of transportation from one place to another  or of
imprisonment in a fortress where  living in security and indolence  they
only become weaker and more depraved  or the worse than uselessness and
injustice  the positive insanity and barbarity of preparations for war
and of wars  causing devastation and ruin  and having no kind of
justification  yet these forms of violence continue and are supported by
the very people who see their uselessness  injustice  and cruelty  and
suffer from them  if fifty years ago the idle rich man and the
illiterate laborer were both alike convinced that their state of
everlasting holiday for one and everlasting toil for the other was
ordained by god himself  we know very well that nowadays  thanks to the
growth of population and the diffusion of books and education  it would
be hard to find in europe or even in russia  either among rich or poor 
a man to whom in one shape or another a doubt as to the justice of this
state of things had never presented itself  the rich know that they are
guilty in the very fact of being rich  and try to expiate their guilt by
sacrifices to art and science  as of old they expiated their sins by
sacrifices to the church  and even the larger half of the working people
openly declare that the existing order is iniquitous and bound to be
destroyed or reformed  one set of religious people of whom there are
millions in russia  the socalled sectaries  consider the existing
social order as unjust and to be destroyed on the ground of the gospel
teaching taken in its true sense  others regard it as unjust on the
ground of the socialistic  communistic  or anarchistic theories  which
are springing up in the lower strata of the working people  violence no
longer rests on the belief in its utility  but only on the fact of its
having existed so long  and being organized by the ruling classes who
profit by it  so that those who are under their authority cannot
extricate themselves from it  the governments of our dayall of them 
the most despotic and the liberal alikehave become what herzen so well
called ghenghis khan with the telegraph  that is to say  organizations
of violence based on no principle but the grossest tyranny  and at the
same time taking advantage of all the means invented by science for the
peaceful collective social activity of free and equal men  used by them
to enslave and oppress their fellows 

governments and the ruling classes no longer take their stand on
right or even on the semblance of justice  but on a skillful
organization carried to such a point of perfection by the aid of
science that everyone is caught in the circle of violence and has
no chance of escaping from it  this circle is made up now of four
methods of working upon men  joined together like the limes of a
chain ring 

the first and oldest method is intimidation  this consists in
representing the existing state organizationwhatever it may be 
free republic or the most savage despotismas something sacred
and immutable  and therefore following any efforts to alter it
with the cruellest punishments  this method is in use nowas it
has been from olden timeswherever there is a government in
russia against the socalled nihilists  in america against
anarchists  in france against imperialists  legitimists 
communards  and anarchists 

railways  telegraphs  telephones  photographs  and the great
perfection of the means of getting rid of men for years  without
killing them  by solitary confinement  where  hidden from the
world  they perish and are forgotten  and the many other modern
inventions employed by government  give such power that when once
authority has come into certain hands  the police  open and
secret  the administration and prosecutors  jailers and
executioners of all kinds  do their work so zealously that there
is no chance of overturning the government  however cruel and
senseless it may be 

the second method is corruption  it consists in plundering the
industrious working people of their wealth by means of taxes and
distributing it in satisfying the greed of officials  who are
bound in return to support and keep up the oppression of the
people  these bought officials  from the highest ministers to the
poorest copying clerks  make up an unbroken network of men bound
together by the same interestthat of living at the expense of
the people  they become the richer the more submissively they
carry out the will of the government  and at all times and places 
sticking at nothing  in all departments support by word and deed
the violence of government  on which their own prosperity also
rests 

the third method is what i can only describe as hypnotizing the
people  this consists in checking the moral development of men 
and by various suggestions keeping them back in the ideal of life 
outgrown by mankind at large  on which the power of government
rests  this hypnotizing process is organized at the present in the
most complex manner  and starting from their earliest childhood 
continues to act on men till the day of their death  it begins in
their earliest years in the compulsory schools  created for this
purpose  in which the children have instilled into them the ideas
of life of their ancestors  which are in direct antagonism with
the conscience of the modern world  in countries where there is a
state religion  they teach the children the senseless blasphemies
of the church catechisms  together with the duty of obedience to
their superiors  in republican states they teach them the savage
superstition of patriotism and the same pretended obedience to the
governing authorities 

the process is kept up during later years by the encouragement of
religious and patriotic superstitions 

the religious superstition is encouraged by establishing  with
money taken from the people  temples  processions  memorials  and
festivals  which  aided by painting  architecture  music  and
incense  intoxicate the people  and above all by the support of
the clergy  whose duty consists in brutalizing the people and
keeping them in a permanent state of stupefaction by their
teaching  the solemnity of their services  their sermons  and
their interference in private lifeat births  deaths  and
marriages  the patriotic superstition is encouraged by the
creation  with money taken from the people  of national f√™tes 
spectacles  monuments  and festivals to dispose men to attach
importance to their own nation  and to the aggrandizement of the
state and its rulers  and to feel antagonism and even hatred for
other nations  with these objects under despotic governments there
is direct prohibition against printing and disseminating books to
enlighten the people  and everyone who might rouse the people from
their lethargy is exiled or imprisoned  moreover  under every
government without exception everything is kept back that might
emancipate and everything encouraged that tends to corrupt the
people  such as literary works tending to keep them in the
barbarism of religious and patriotic superstition  all kinds of
sensual amusements  spectacles  circuses  theaters  and even the
physical means of inducing stupefaction  as tobacco and alcohol 
which form the principal source of revenue of states  even
prostitution is encouraged  and not only recognized  but even
organized by the government in the majority of states  so much for
the third method 

the fourth method consists in selecting from all the men who have
been stupefied and enslaved by the three former methods a certain
number  exposing them to special and intensified means of
stupefaction and brutalization  and so making them into a passive
instrument for carrying out all the cruelties and brutalities
needed by the government  this result is attained by taking them
at the youthful age when men have not had time to form clear and
definite principles of morals  and removing them from all natural
and human conditions of life  home  family and kindred  and useful
labor  they are shut up together in barracks  dressed in special
clothes  and worked upon by cries  drums  music  and shining
objects to go through certain daily actions invented for this
purpose  and by this means are brought into an hypnotic condition
in which they cease to be men and become mere senseless machines 
submissive to the hypnotizer  these physically vigorous young men
in these days of universal conscription  all young men 
hypnotized  armed with murderous weapons  always obedient to the
governing authorities and ready for any act of violence at their
command  constitute the fourth and principal method of enslaving
men 

by this method the circle of violence is completed 

intimidation  corruption  and hypnotizing bring people into a
condition in which they are willing to be soldiers  the soldiers
give the power of punishing and plundering them and purchasing
officials with the spoils  and hypnotizing them and converting
them in time into these same soldiers again 

the circle is complete  and there is no chance of breaking through
it by force 

some persons maintain that freedom from violence  or at least a
great diminution of it  may be gained by the oppressed forcibly
overturning the oppressive government and replacing it by a new
one under which such violence and oppression will be unnecessary 
but they deceive themselves and others  and their efforts do not
better the position of the oppressed  but only make it worse 
their conduct only tends to increase the despotism of government 
their efforts only afford a plausible pretext for government to
strengthen their power 

even if we admit that under a combination of circumstances
specially unfavorable for the government  as in france in 1870 
any government might be forcibly overturned and the power
transferred to other hands  the new authority would rarely be less
oppressive than the old one  on the contrary  always having to
defend itself against its dispossessed and exasperated enemies  it
would be more despotic and cruel  as has always been the rule in
all revolutions 

while socialists and communists regard the individualistic 
capitalistic organization of society as an evil  and the
anarchists regard as an evil all government whatever  there are
royalists  conservatives  and capitalists who consider any
socialistic or communistic organization or anarchy as an evil  and
all these parties have no means other than violence to bring men
to agreement  whichever of these parties were successful in
bringing their schemes to pass  must resort to support its
authority to all the existing methods of violence  and even invent
new ones 

the oppressed would be another set of people  and coercion would
take some new form  but the violence and oppression would be
unchanged or even more cruel  since hatred would be intensified by
the struggle  and new forms of oppression would have been devised 
so it has always been after all revolutions and all attempts at
revolution  all conspiracies  and all violent changes of
government  every conflict only strengthens the means of
oppression in the hands of those who happen at a given moment to
be in power 

the position of our christian society  and especially the ideals
most current in it  prove this in a strikingly convincing way 

there remains now only one sphere of human life not encroached
upon by government authoritythat is the domestic  economic
sphere  the sphere of private life and labor  and even this is
nowthanks to the efforts of communists and socialistsbeing
gradually encroached upon by government  so that labor and
recreation  dwellings  dress  and food will gradually  if the
hopes of the reformers are successful  be prescribed and regulated
by government 

the slow progress of eighteen centuries has brought the christian
nations again to the necessity of deciding the question they have
evadedthe question of the acceptance or nonacceptance of
christs teaching  and the question following upon it in social
life of resistance or nonresistance to evil by force  but there
is this difference  that whereas formerly men could accept or
refuse to accept the solution given by christ  now that solution
cannot be avoided  since it alone can save men from the slavery in
which they are caught like a net 

but it is not only the misery of the position which makes this
inevitable 

while the pagan organization has been proved more and more false 
the truth of the christian religion has been growing more and more
evident 

not in vain have the best men of christian humanity  who
apprehended the truth by spiritual intuition  for eighteen
centuries testified to it in spite of every menace  every
privation  and every suffering  by their martyrdom they passed on
the truth to the masses  and impressed it on their hearts 

christianity has penetrated into the consciousness of humanity 
not only negatively by the demonstration of the impossibility of
continuing in the pagan life  but also through its simplification 
its increased clearness and freedom from the superstitions
intermingled with it  and its diffusion through all classes of the
population 

eighteen centuries of christianity have not passed without an
effect even on those who accepted it only externally  these
eighteen centuries have brought men so far that even while they
continue to live the pagan life which is no longer consistent with
the development of humanity  they not only see clearly all the
wretchedness of their position  but in the depths of their souls
they believe they can only live through this belief that the
only salvation from this position is to be found in fulfilling the
christian doctrine in its true significance  as to the time and
manner of salvation  opinions are divided according to the
intellectual development and the prejudices of each society  but
every man of the modern world recognizes that our salvation lies
in fulfilling the law of christ  some believers in the
supernatural character of christianity hold that salvation will
come when all men are brought to believe in christ  whose second
coming is at hand  other believers in supernatural christianity
hold that salvation will come through the church  which will draw
all men into its fold  train them in the christian virtues  and
transform their life  a third section  who do not admit the
divinity of christ  hold that the salvation of mankind will be
brought about by slow and gradual progress  through which the
pagan principles of our existence will be replaced by the
principles of liberty  equality  and fraternitythat is  by
christian principles  a fourth section  who believe in the social
revolution  hold that salvation will come when through a violent
revolution men are forced into community of property  abolition of
government  and collective instead of individual industrythat is
to say  the realization of one side of the christian doctrine  in
one way or another all men of our day in their inner consciousness
condemn the existing effete pagan order  and admit  often
unconsciously and while regarding themselves as hostile to
christianity  that our salvation is only to be found in the
application of the christian doctrine  or parts of it  in its true
significance to our daily life 

christianity cannot  as its founder said  be realized by the
majority of men all at once  it must grow like a huge tree from a
tiny seed  and so it has grown  and now has reached its full
development  not yet in actual life  but in the conscience of men
of today 

now not only the minority  who have always comprehended
christianity by spiritual intuition  but all the vast majority who
seem so far from it in their social existence recognize its true
significance 

look at individual men in their private life  listen to their
standards of conduct in their judgment of one another  hear not
only their public utterances  but the counsels given by parents
and guardians to the young in their charge  and you will see that 
far as their social life based on violence may be from realizing
christian truth  in their private life what is considered good by
all without exception is nothing but the christian virtues  what
is considered as bad is nothing but the antichristian vices  those
who consecrate their lives selfsacrificingly to the service of
humanity are regarded as the best men  the selfish  who make use
of the misfortunes of others for their own advantage  are regarded
as the worst of men 

though some nonchristian ideals  such as strength  courage  and
wealth  are still worshiped by a few who have not been penetrated
by the christian spirit  these ideals are out of date and are
abandoned  if not by all  at least by all those regarded as the
best people  there are no ideals  other than the christian ideals 
which are accepted by all and regarded as binding on all 

the position of our christian humanity  if you look at it from the
outside with all its cruelty and degradation of men  is terrible
indeed  but if one looks at it within  in its inner consciousness 
the spectacle it presents is absolutely different 

all the evil of our life seems to exist only because it has been
so for so long  those who do the evil have not had time yet to
learn how to act otherwise  though they do not want to act as they
do 

all the evil seems to exist through some cause independent of the
conscience of men 

strange and contradictory as it seems  all men of the present day
hate the very social order they are themselves supporting 

i think it is max m√ºller who describes the amazement of an indian
convert to christianity  who after absorbing the essence of the
christian doctrine came to europe and saw the actual life of
christians  he could not recover from his astonishment at the
complete contrast between the reality and what he had expected to
find among christian nations  if we feel no astonishment at the
contrast between our convictions and our conduct  that is because
the influences  tending to obscure the contrast  produce an effect
upon us too  we need only look at our life from the point of view
of that indian  who understood christianity in its true
significance  without any compromises or concessions  we need but
look at the savage brutalities of which our life is full  to be
appalled at the contradictions in the midst of which we live often
without observing them 

we need only recall the preparations for war  the mitrailleuses 
the silvergilt bullets  the torpedoes  andthe red cross  the
solitary prison cells  the experiments of execution by
electricityand the care of the hygienic welfare of prisoners 
the philanthropy of the rich  and their life  which produces the
poor they are benefiting 

and these inconsistencies are not  as it might seem  because men
pretend to be christians while they are really pagans  but because
of something lacking in men  or some kind of force hindering them
from being what they already feel themselves to be in their
consciousness  and what they genuinely wish to be   men of the
present day do not merely pretend to hate oppression  inequality 
class distinction  and every kind of cruelty to animals as well as
human beings   they genuinely detest all this  but they do not
know how to put a stop to it  or perhaps cannot decide to give up
what preserves it all  and seems to them necessary 

indeed  ask every man separately whether he thinks it laudable and
worthy of a man of this age to hold a position from which he
receives a salary disproportionate to his work  to take from the
peopleoften in povertytaxes to be spent on constructing
cannon  torpedoes  and other instruments of butchery  so as to
make war on people with whom we wish to be at peace  and who feel
the same wish in regard to us  or to receive a salary for devoting
ones whole life to constructing these instruments of butchery  or
to preparing oneself and others for the work of murder   and ask
him whether it is laudable and worthy of a man  and suitable for a
christian  to employ himself  for a salary  in seizing wretched 
misguided  often illiterate and drunken  creatures because they
appropriate the property of otherson a much smaller scale than
we door because they kill men in a different fashion from that
in which we undertake to do itand shutting them in prison for
it  ill treating them and killing them  and whether it is laudable
and worthy of a man and a christian to preach for a salary to the
people not christianity  but superstitions which one knows to be
stupid and pernicious  and whether it is laudable and worthy of a
man to rob his neighbor for his gratification of what he wants to
satisfy his simplest needs  as the great landowners do  or to
force him to exhausting labor beyond his strength to augment ones
wealth  as do factory owners and manufacturers  or to profit by
the poverty of men to increase ones gains  as merchants do   and
everyone taken separately  especially if ones remarks are
directed at someone else  not himself  will answer  no   and yet
the very man who sees all the baseness of those actions  of his
own free will  uncoerced by anyone  often even for no pecuniary
profit  but only from childish vanity  for a china cross  a scrap
of ribbon  a bit of fringe he is allowed to wear  will enter
military service  become a magistrate or justice of the peace 
commissioner  archbishop  or beadle  though in fulfilling these
offices he must commit acts the baseness and shamefulness of which
he cannot fail to recognize 

i know that many of these men will confidently try to prove that
they have reasons for regarding their position as legitimate and
quite indispensable   they will say in their defense that
authority is given by god  that the functions of the state are
indispensable for the welfare of humanity  that property is not
opposed to christianity  that the rich young man was only
commanded to sell all he had and give to the poor if he wished to
be perfect  that the existing distribution of property and our
commercial system must always remain as they are  and are to the
advantage of all  and so on   but  however much they try to
deceive themselves and others  they all know that what they are
doing is opposed to all the beliefs which they profess  and in the
depths of their souls  when they are left alone with their
conscience  they are ashamed and miserable at the recollection of
it  especially if the baseness of their action has been pointed
out to them   a man of the present day  whether he believes in the
divinity of christ or not  cannot fail to see that to assist in
the capacity of tzar  minister  governor  or commissioner in
taking from a poor family its last cow for taxes to be spent on
cannons  or on the pay and pensions of idle officials  who live in
luxury and are worse than useless  or in putting into prison some
man we have ourselves corrupted  and throwing his family on the
streets  or in plundering and butchering in war  or in inculcating
savage and idolatrous superstitious in the place of the law of
christ  or in impounding the cow found on ones land  though it
belongs to a man who has no land  or to cheat the workman in a
factory  by imposing fines for accidentally spoiled articles  or
making a poor man pay double the value for anything simply because
he is in the direst poverty not a man of the present day can
fail to know that all these actions are base and disgraceful  and
that they need not do them   they all know it   they know that
what they are doing is wrong  and would not do it for anything in
the world if they had the power of resisting the forces which shut
their eyes to the criminality of their actions and impel them to
commit them 

in nothing is the pitch of inconsistency modern life has attained
to so evident as in universal conscription  which is the last
resource and the final expression of violence 

indeed  it is only because this state of universal armament has
been brought about gradually and imperceptibly  and because
governments have exerted  in maintaining it  every resource of
intimidation  corruption  brutalization  and violence  that we do
not see its flagrant inconsistency with the christian ideas and
sentiments by which the modern world is permeated 

we are so accustomed to the inconsistency that we do not see all
the hideous folly and immorality of men voluntarily choosing the
profession of butchery as though it were an honorable career  of
poor wretches submitting to conscription  or in countries where
compulsory service has not been introduced  of people voluntarily
abandoning a life of industry to recruit soldiers and train them
as murderers   we know that all of these men are either
christians  or profess humane and liberal principles  and they
know that they thus become partly responsiblethrough universal
conscription  personally responsiblefor the most insane 
aimless  and brutal murders   and yet they all do it 

more than that  in germany  where compulsory service first
originated  caprivi has given expression to what had been hitherto
so assiduously concealedthat is  that the men that the soldiers
will have to kill are not foreigners alone  but their own
countrymen  the very working people from whom they themselves are
taken   and this admission has not opened peoples eyes  has not
horrified them  they still go like sheep to the slaughter  and
submit to everything required of them 

and that is not all the emperor of germany has lately shown still
more clearly the duties of the army  by thanking and rewarding a
soldier for killing a defenseless citizen who made his approach
incautiously   by rewarding an action always regarded as base and
cowardly even by men on the lowest level of morality  william has
shown that a soldiers chief dutythe one most appreciated by the
authoritiesis that of executioner  and not a professional
executioner who kills only condemned criminals  but one ready to
butcher any innocent man at the word of command 

and even that is not all  in 1892  the same william  the enfant
terrible of state authority  who says plainly what other people
only think  in addressing some soldiers gave public utterance to
the following speech  which was reported next day in thousands of
newspapers conscripts  he said  you have sworn fidelity to me
before the altar and the minister of god   you are still too young
to understand all the importance of what has been said here  let
your care before all things be to obey the orders and instructions
given you   you have sworn fidelity to me  lads of my guard  that
means that you are now my soldiers  that you have given yourselves
to me body and soul   for you there is now but one enemy  my
enemy   in these days of socialistic sedition it may come to pass
that i command you to fire on your own kindred  your brothers 
even your own fathers and motherswhich god forbid even then
you are bound to obey my orders without hesitation 

this man expresses what all sensible rulers think  but studiously
conceal   he says openly that the soldiers are in his service  at
his disposal  and must be ready for his advantage to murder even
their brothers and fathers 

in the most brutal words he frankly exposes all the horrors and
criminality for which men prepare themselves in entering the army 
and the depths of ignominy to which they fall in promising
obedience   like a bold hypnotizer  he tests the degree of
insensibility of the hypnotized subject   he touches his skin with
a redhot iron  the skin smokes and scorches  but the sleeper does
not awake 

this miserable man  imbecile and drunk with power  outrages in
this utterance everything that can be sacred for a man of the
modern world   and yet all the christians  liberals  and
cultivated people  far from resenting this outrage  did not even
observe it 

the last  the most extreme test is put before men in its coarsest
form   and they do not seem even to notice that it is a test  that
there is any choice about it   they seem to think there is no
course open but slavish submission   one would have thought these
insane words  which outrage everything a man of the present day
holds sacred  must rouse indignation   but there has been nothing
of the kind 

all the young men through the whole of europe are exposed year
after year to this test  and with very few exceptions they
renounce all that a man can hold sacred  all express their
readiness to kill their brothers  even their fathers  at the
bidding of the first crazy creature dressed up in a livery with
red and gold trimming  and only wait to be told where and when
they are to kill   and they actually are ready 

every savage has something he holds sacred  something for which he
is ready to suffer  something he will not consent to do   but what
is it that is sacred to the civilized man of today   they say to
him  you must become my slave  and this slavery may force you
to kill even your own father  and he  often very well educated 
trained in all the sciences at the university  quietly puts his
head under the yoke   they dress him up in a clowns costume  and
order him to cut capers  turn and twist and bow  and killhe does
it all submissively   and when they let him go  he seems to shake
himself and go back to his former life  and he continues to
discourse upon the dignity of man  liberty  equality  and
fraternity as before 

yes  but what is one to do  people often ask in genuine
perplexity   if everyone would stand out it would be something 
but by myself  i shall only suffer without doing any good to
anyone 

and that is true  a man with the social conception of life cannot
resist  the aim of his life is his personal welfare  it is better
for his personal welfare for him to submit  and he submits 

whatever they do to him  however they torture or humiliate him  he
will submit  for  alone  he can do nothing  he has no principle
for the sake of which he could resist violence alone   and those
who control them never allow them to unite together   it is often
said that the invention of terrible weapons of destruction will
put an end to war   that is an error   as the means of
extermination are improved  the means of reducing men who hold the
state conception of life to submission can be improved to
correspond   they may slaughter them by thousands  by millions 
they may tear them to pieces  still they will march to war like
senseless cattle   some will want beating to make them move 
others will be proud to go if they are allowed to wear a scrap of
ribbon or gold lace 

and of this mass of men so brutalized as to be ready to promise to
kill their own parents  the social reformersconservatives 
liberals  socialists  and anarchistspropose to form a rational
and moral society   what sort of moral and rational society can be
formed out of such elements   with warped and rotten planks you
cannot build a house  however you put them together   and to form
a rational moral society of such men is just as impossible a task 
they can be formed into nothing but a herd of cattle  driven by
the shouts and whips of the herdsmen  as indeed they are 

so  then  we have on one side men calling themselves christians 
and professing the principles of liberty  equality  and
fraternity  and along with that ready  in the name of liberty  to
submit to the most slavish degradation  in the name of equality 
to accept the crudest  most senseless division of men by externals
merely into higher and lower classes  allies and enemies  and  in
the name of fraternity  ready to murder their brothers see
footnote 

    footnote the fact that among certain nations  as
    the english and the american  military service is not
    compulsory though already one hears there are some
    who advocate that it should be made so does not
    affect the servility of the citizens to the government
    in principle   here we have each to go and kill or be
    killed  there they have each to give the fruit of their
    toil to pay for the recruiting and training of soldiers 

the contradiction between life and conscience and the misery
resulting from it have reached the extreme limit and can go no
further   the state organization of life based on violence  the
aim of which was the security of personal  family  and social
welfare  has come to the point of renouncing the very objects for
which it was foundedit has reduced men to absolute renunciation
and loss of the welfare it was to secure 

the first half of the prophecy has been fulfilled in the
generation of men who have not accepted christs teaching  their
descendants have been brought now to the absolute necessity of

the acceptance of the christian conception of life will emancipate
men from the miseries of our pagan life 

the external life of christian peoples remains pagan though they are
penetrated by christian consciousnessthe way out of this contradiction
is by the acceptance of the christian theory of lifeonly through
christianity is every man free  and emancipated of all human
authoritythis emancipation can be effected by no change in external
conditions of life  but only by a change in the conception of lifethe
christian ideal of life requires renunciation of all violence  and in
emancipating the man who accepts it  emancipates the whole world from
all external authoritiesthe way out of the present apparently hopeless
position is for every man who is capable of assimilating the christian
conception of life  to accept it and live in accordance with itbut men
consider this way too slow  and look for deliverance through changes in
material conditions of life aided by governmentthat will lead to no
improvement  as it is simply increasing the evil under which men are
sufferinga striking instance of this is the submission to compulsory
military service  which it would be more advantageous for every man to
refuse than to submit tothe emancipation of men can only be brought
about by each individual emancipating himself  and the examples of this
selfemancipation which are already appearing threaten the destruction
of governmental authorityrefusal to comply with the unchristian
demands of government undermines the authority of the state and
emancipates menand therefore cases of such noncompliance are regarded
with more dread by state authorities than any conspiracies or acts of
violenceexamples of noncompliance in russia  in regard to oath of
allegiance  payment of taxes  passports  police duties  and military
serviceexamples of such noncompliance in other statesgovernments do
not know how to treat men who refuse to comply with their demands on
christian groundssuch people  without striking a blow  undermine the
very basis of government from withinto punish them is equivalent to
openly renouncing christianity  and assisting in diffusing the very
principle by which these men justify their noncomplianceso
governments are in a helpless positionmen who maintain the uselessness
of personal independence  only retard the dissolution of the present
state organization based on force 


the position of the christian peoples in our days has remained
just as cruel as it was in the times of paganism   in many
respects  especially in the oppression of the masses  it has
become even more cruel than it was in the days of paganism 

but between the condition of men in ancient times and their
condition in our days there is just the difference that we see in
the world of vegetation between the last days of autumn and the
first days of spring   in the autumn the external lifelessness in
nature corresponds with its inward condition of death  while in
the spring the external lifelessness is in sharp contrast with the
internal state of reviving and passing into new forms of life 

in the same way the similarity between the ancient heathen life
and the life of today is merely external the inward condition of
men in the times of heathenism was absolutely different from their
inward condition at the present time 

then the outward condition of cruelty and of slavery was in
complete harmony with the inner conscience of men  and every step
in advance intensified this harmony  now the outward condition of
cruelty and of slavery is completely contradictory to the
christian consciousness of men  and every step in advance only
intensifies this contradiction 

humanity is passing through seemingly unnecessary  fruitless
agonies   it is passing through something like the throes of
birth  everything is ready for the new life  but still the new
life does not come 

there seems no way out of the position   and there would be none 
except that a man and thereby all men is gifted with the power
of forming a different  higher theory of life  which at once frees
him from all the bonds by which he seems indissolubly fettered 

and such a theory is the christian view of life made known to
mankind eighteen hundred years ago 

a man need only make this theory of life his own  for the fetters
which seemed so indissolubly forged upon him to drop off of
themselves  and for him to feel himself absolutely free  just as a
bird would feel itself free in a fencedin place directly it tools
to its wings 

people talk about the liberty of the christian church  about
giving or not giving freedom to christians   underlying all these
ideas and expressions there is some strange misconception 
freedom cannot be bestowed on or taken from a christian or
christians   freedom is an inalienable possession of the
christian 

if we talk of bestowing freedom on christians or withholding it
from them  we are obviously talking not of real christians but of
people who only call themselves christians   a christian cannot
fail to be free  because the attainment of the aim he sets before
himself cannot be prevented or even hindered by anyone or
anything 

let a man only understand his life as christianity teaches him to
understand it  let him understand  that is  that his life belongs
not to himnot to his own individuality  nor to his family  nor
to the statebut to him who has sent him into the world  and let
him once understand that he must therefore fulfill not the law of
his own individuality  nor his family  nor of the state  but the
infinite law of him from whom he has come  and he will not only
feel himself absolutely free from every human power  but will even
cease to regard such power as at all able to hamper anyone 

let a man but realize that the aim of his life is the fulfillment
of gods law  and that law will replace all other laws for him 
and he will give it his sole allegiance  so that by that very
allegiance every human law will lose all binding and controlling
power in his eyes 

the christian is independent of every human authority by the fact
that he regards the divine law of love  implanted in the soul of
every man  and brought before his consciousness by christ  as the
sole guide of his life and other mens also 

the christian may be subjected to external violence  he may be
deprived of bodily freedom  he may be in bondage to his passions
he who commits sin is the slave of sin  but he cannot be in
bondage in the sense of being forced by any danger or by any
threat of external harm to perform an act which is against his
conscience 

he cannot be compelled to do this  because the deprivations and
sufferings which form such a powerful weapon against men of the
state conception of life  have not the least power to compel him 

deprivations and sufferings take from them the happiness for which
they live  but far from disturbing the happiness of the christian 
which consists in the consciousness of fulfilling the will of god 
they may even intensify it  when they are inflicted on him for
fulfilling his will 

and therefore the christian  who is subject only to the inner
divine law  not only cannot carry out the enactments of the
external law  when they are not in agreement with the divine law
of love which he acknowledges as is usually the case with state
obligations  he cannot even recognize the duty of obedience to
anyone or anything whatever  he cannot recognize the duty of what
is called allegiance 

for a christian the oath of allegiance to any government whatever
the very act which is regarded as the foundation of the
existence of a stateis a direct renunciation of christianity 
for the man who promises unconditional obedience in the future to
laws  made or to be made  by that very promise is in the most 
positive manner renouncing christianity  which means obeying in
every circumstance of life only the divine law of love he
recognizes within him 

under the pagan conception of life it was possible to carry out
the will of the temporal authorities  without infringing the law
of god expressed in circumcisions  sabbaths  fixed times of
prayer  abstention from certain kinds of food  and so on   the one
law was not opposed to the other   but that is just the
distinction between the christian religion and heathen religion 
christianity does not require of a man certain definite negative
acts  but puts him in a new  different relation to men  from which
may result the most diverse acts  which cannot be defined
beforehand   and therefore the christian not only cannot promise
to obey the will of any other man  without knowing what will be
required by that will  he not only cannot obey the changing laws
of man  but he cannot even promise to do anything definite at a
certain time  or to abstain from doing anything for a certain
time   for he cannot know what at any time will be required of him
by that christian law of love  obedience to which constitutes the
meaning of life for him   the christian  in promising
unconditional fulfillment of the laws of men in the future  would
show plainly by that promise that the inner law of god does not
constitute for him the sole law of his life 

for a christian to promise obedience to men  or the laws of men 
is just as though a workman bound to one employer should also
promise to carry out every order that might be given him by
outsiders   one cannot serve two masters 

the christian is independent of human authority  because he
acknowledges gods authority alone   his law  revealed by christ 
he recognizes in himself  and voluntarily obeys it 

and this independence is gained  not by means of strife  not by
the destruction of existing forms of life  but only by a change in
the interpretation of life   this independence results first from
the christian recognizing the law of love  revealed to him by his
teacher  as perfectly sufficient for all human relations  and
therefore he regards every use of force as unnecessary and
unlawful  and secondly  from the fact that those deprivations and
sufferings  or threats of deprivations and sufferings which
reduce the man of the social conception of life to the necessity
of obeying to the christian from his different conception of
life  present themselves merely as the inevitable conditions of
existence   and these conditions  without striving against them by
force  he patiently endures  like sickness  hunger  and every
other hardship  but they cannot serve him as a guide for his
actions   the only guide for the christians actions is to be
found in the divine principle living within him  which cannot be
checked or governed by anything 

the christian acts according to the words of the prophecy applied
to his teacher he shall not strive  nor cry  neither shall any
man hear his voice in the streets   a bruised reed shall he not
break  and smoking flax shall he not quench  till he send forth
judgment unto victory  matt  xii  19  20 

the christian will not dispute with anyone  nor attack anyone  nor
use violence against anyone  on the contrary  he will bear
violence without opposing it   but by this very attitude to
violence  he will not only himself be free  but will free the
whole world from all external power 

ye shall know the truth  and the truth shall make you free   if
there were any doubt of christianity being the truth  the perfect
liberty  that nothing can curtail  which a man experiences
directly he makes the christian theory of life his own  would be
an unmistakable proof of its truth 

men in their present condition are like a swarm of bees hanging in
a cluster to a branch   the position of the bees on the branch is
temporary  and must inevitably be changed   they must start off
and find themselves a habitation   each of the bees knows this 
and desires to change her own and the others position  but no one
of them can do it till the rest of them do it   they cannot all
start off at once  because one hangs on to another and hinders her
from separating from the swarm  and therefore they all continue to
hang there   it would seem that the bees could never escape from
their position  just as it seems that worldly men  caught in the
toils of the state conception of life  can never escape   and
there would be no escape for the bees  if each of them were not a
living  separate creature  endowed with wings of its own 
similarly there would be no escape for men  if each were not a
living being endowed with the faculty of entering into the
christian conception of life 

if every bee who could fly  did not try to fly  the others  too 
would never be stirred  and the swarm would never change its
position   and if the man who has mastered the christian
conception of life would not  without waiting for other people 
begin to live in accordance with this conception  mankind would
never change its position   but only let one bee spread her wings 
start off  and fly away  and after her another  and another  and
the clinging  inert cluster would become a freely flying swarm of
bees   just in the same way  only let one man look at life as
christianity teaches him to look at it  and after him let another
and another do the same  and the enchanted circle of existence in
the state conception of life  from which there seemed no escape 
will be broken through 

but men think that to set all men free by this means is
too slow a process  that they must find some other means by which
they could set all men free at once   it is just as though the
bees who want to start and fly away should consider it too long a
process to wait for all the swarm to start one by one  and should
think they ought to find some means by which it would not be
necessary for every separate bee to spread her wings and fly off 
but by which the whole swarm could fly at once where it wanted to 
but that is not possible  till a first  a second  a third  a
hundredth bee spreads her wings and flies off of her own accord 
the swarm will not fly off and will not begin its new life   till
every individual man makes the christian conception of life his
own  and begins to live in accord with it  there can be no
solution of the problem of human life  and no establishment of a
new form of life 

one of the most striking phenomena of our times is precisely this
advocacy of slavery  which is promulgated among the masses  not by
governments  in whom it is inevitable  but by men who  in
advocating socialistic theories  regard themselves as the
champions of freedom 

these people advance the opinion that the amelioration of life 
the bringing of the facts of life into harmony with the
conscience  will come  not as the result of the personal efforts
of individual men  but of itself as the result of a certain
possible reconstruction of society effected in some way or other 
the idea is promulgated that men ought not to walk on their own
legs where they want and ought to go  but that a kind of floor
under their feet will be moved somehow  so that on it they can
reach where they ought to go without moving their own legs   and 
therefore  all their efforts ought to be directed  not to going so
far as their strength allows in the direction they ought to go 
but to standing still and constructing such a floor 

in the sphere of political economy a theory is propounded which
amounts to saying that the worse things are the better they are 
that the greater the accumulation of capital  and therefore the
oppression of the workman  the nearer the day of emancipation 
and  therefore  every personal effort on the part of a man to free
himself from the oppression of capital is useless   in the sphere
of government it is maintained that the greater the power of the
government  which  according to this theory  ought to intervene in
every department of private life in which it has not yet
intervened  the better it will be  and that therefore we ought to
invoke the interference of government in private life   in
politics and international questions it is maintained that the
improvement of the means of destruction  the multiplication of
armaments  will lead to the necessity of making war by means of
congresses  arbitration  and so on   and  marvelous to say  so
great is the dullness of men  that they believe in these theories 
in spite of the fact that the whole course of life  every step
they take  shows how unworthy they are of belief 

the people are suffering from oppression  and to deliver them from
this oppression they are advised to frame general measures for the
improvement of their position  which measures are to be intrusted
to the authorities  and themselves to continue to yield obedience
to the authorities   and obviously all that results from this is
only greater power in the hands of the authorities  and greater
oppression resulting from it 

not one of the errors of men carries them so far away from the aim
toward which they are struggling as this very one   they do all
kinds of different things for the attainment of their aim  but not
the one simple obvious thing which is within reach of everyone 
they devise the subtlest means for changing the position which is
irksome to them  but not that simplest means  that everyone should
refrain from doing what leads to that position 

i have been told a story of a gallant police officer  who came to
a village where the peasants were in insurrection and the military
had been called out  and he undertook to pacify the insurrection
in the spirit of nicholas i   by his personal influence alone   he
ordered some loads of rods to be brought  and collecting all the
peasants together into a barn  he went in with them  locking the
door after him   to begin with  he so terrified the peasants by
his loud threats that  reduced to submission by him  they set to
work to flog one another at his command   and so they flogged one
another until a simpleton was found who would not allow himself to
be flogged  and shouted to his companions not to flog one another 
only then the fogging ceased  and the police officer made his
escape   well  this simpletons advice would never be followed by
men of the state conception of life  who continue to flog one
another  and teach people that this very act of selfcastigation
is the last word of human wisdom 

indeed  can one imagine a more striking instance of men flogging
themselves than the submissiveness with which men of our times
will perform the very duties required of them to keep them in
slavery  especially the duty of military service   we see people
enslaving themselves  suffering from this slavery  and believing
that it must be so  that it does not matter  and will not hinder
the emancipation of men  which is being prepared somewhere 
somehow  in spite of the everincreasing growth of slavery 

in fact  take any man of the present time whatever i dont mean a
true christian  but an average man of the present day  educated
or uneducated  believing or unbelieving  rich or poor  married or
unmarried   such a man lives working at his work  or enjoying his
amusements  spending the fruits of his labors on himself or on
those near to him  and  like everyone  hating every kind of
restriction and deprivation  dissension and suffering   such a man
is going his way peaceably  when suddenly people come and say to
him first  promise and swear to us that you will slavishly obey
us in everything we dictate to you  and will consider absolutely
good and authoritative everything we plan  decide  and call law 
secondly  hand over a part of the fruits of your labors for us to
dispose ofwe will use the money to keep you in slavery  and to
hinder you from forcibly opposing our orders   thirdly  elect
others  or be yourself elected  to take a pretended share in the
government  knowing all the while that the government will proceed
quite without regard to the foolish speeches you  and those like
you  may utter  and knowing that its proceedings will be according
to our will  the will of those who have the army in their hands 
fourthly  come at a certain time to the law courts and take your
share in those senseless cruelties which we perpetrate on sinners 
and those whom we have corrupted  in the shape of penal servitude 
exile  solitary confinement  and death   and fifthly and lastly 
more than all this  in spite of the fact that you maybe on the
friendliest terms with people of other nations  be ready  directly
we order you to do so  to regard those whom we indicate to you as
your enemies  and be ready to assist  either in person or by
proxy  in devastation  plunder  and murder of their men  women 
children  and aged alikepossibly your own kinsmen or relationsif
that is necessary to us 

one would expect that every man of the present day who has a grain
of sense left  might reply to such requirements  but why should i
do all this   one would think every rightminded man must say in
amazement why should i promise to yield obedience to everything
that has been decreed first by salisbury  then by gladstone  one
day by boulanger  and another by parliament  one day by peter
iii   the next by catherine  and the day after by pougachef  one
day by a mad king of bavaria  another by william   why should i
promise to obey them  knowing them to be wicked or foolish people 
or else not knowing them at all   why am i to hand over the fruits
of my labors to them in the shape of taxes  knowing that the money
will be spent on the support of officials  prisons  churches 
armies  on things that are harmful  and on my own enslavement 
why should i punish myself   why should i go wasting my time and
hoodwinking myself  giving to miscreant evildoers a semblance of
legality  by taking part in elections  and pretending that i am
taking part in the government  when i know very well that the real
control of the government is in the hands of those who have got
hold of the army   why should i go to the law courts to take part
in the trial and punishment of men because they have sinned 
knowing  if i am a christian  that the law of vengeance is replaced
by the law of love  and  if i am an educated man  that punishments
do not reform  but only deprave those on whom they are inflicted 
and why  most of all  am i to consider as enemies the people of a
neighboring nation  with whom i have hitherto lived and with whom
i wish to live in love and harmony  and to kill and rob them  or
to bring them to misery  simply in order that the keys of the
temple at jerusalem may be in the hands of one archbishop and not
another  that one german and not another may be prince in
bulgaria  or that the english rather than the american merchants
may capture seals 

and why  most of all  should i take part in person or hire others
to murder my own brothers and kinsmen   why should i flog myself 
it is altogether unnecessary for me  it is hurtful to me  and from
every point of view it is immoral  base  and vile   so why should
i do this   if you tell me that if i do it not i shall receive
some injury from someone  then  in the first place  i cannot
anticipate from anyone an injury so great as the injury you bring
on me if i obey you  and secondly  it is perfectly clear to me
that if we our own selves do not flog ourselves  no one will flog
us 

as for the governmentthat means the tzars  ministers  and
officials with pens in their hands  who cannot force us into doing
anything  as that officer of police compelled the peasants  the
men who will drag us to the law court  to prison  and to
execution  are not tzars or officials with pens in their hands 
but the very people who are in the same position as we are   and
it is just as unprofitable and harmful and unpleasant to them to
be flogged as to me  and therefore there is every likelihood that
if i open their eyes they not only would not treat me with
violence  but would do just as i am doing 

thirdly  even if it should come to pass that i had to suffer for it 
even then it would be better for me to be exiled or sent to prison for
standing up for common sense and rightwhich  if not today  at least
within a very short time  must be triumphantthan to suffer for folly
and wrong which must come to an end directly  and therefore  even in
that case  it is better to run the risk of their banishing me  shutting
me up in prison  or executing me  than of my living all my life in
bondage  through my own fault  to wicked men  better is this than the
possibility of being destroyed by victorious enemies  and being stupidly
tortured and killed by them  in fighting for a cannon  or a piece of
land of no use to anyone  or for a senseless rag called a banner 

i dont want to flog myself and i wont do it  i have no reason to do
it  do it yourselves  if you want it done  but i wont do it 

one would have thought that not religious or moral feeling alone 
but the simplest common sense and foresight should impel every man
of the present day to answer and to act in that way   but not so 
men of the state conception of life are of the opinion that to act
in that way is not necessary  and is even prejudicial to the
attainment of their object  the emancipation of men from slavery 
they hold that we must continue  like the police officers
peasants  to flog one another  consoling ourselves with the
reflection that we are talking away in the assemblies and
meetings  founding trades unions  marching through the streets on
the 1st of may  getting up conspiracies  and stealthily teasing
the government that is flogging us  and that through all this it
will be brought to pass that  by enslaving ourselves in closer and
closer bondage  we shall very soon be free 

nothing hinders the emancipation of men from slavery so much as
this amazing error   instead of every man directing his energies
to freeing himself  to transforming his conception of life  people
seek for an external united method of gaining freedom  and
continue to rivet their chains faster and faster 

it is much as if men were to maintain that to make up a fire there
was no need to kindle any of the coals  but that all that was
necessary was to arrange the coals in a certain order   yet the
fact that the freedom of all men will be brought about only
through the freedom of individual persons  becomes more and more
clear as time goes on   the freedom of individual men  in the name
of the christian conception of life  from state domination  which
was formerly an exceptional and unnoticed phenomenon  has of late
acquired threatening significance for state authorities 

if in a former age  in the roman times  it happened that a
christian confessed his religion and refused to take part in
sacrifices  and to worship the emperors or the gods  or in the
middle ages a christian refused to worship images  or to
acknowledge the authority of the popethese cases were in the
first place a matter of chance   a man might be placed under the
necessity of confessing his faith  or he might live all his life
without being placed under this necessity   but now all men 
without exception  are subjected to this trial of their faith 
every man of the present day is under the necessity of taking part
in the cruelties of pagan life  or of refusing all participation
in them   and secondly  in those days cases of refusal to worship
the gods or the images or the pope were not incidents that had any
material bearing on the state   whether men worshiped or did not
worship the gods or the images or the pope  the state remained
just as powerful   but now cases of refusing to comply with the
unchristian demands of the government are striking at the very
root of state authority  because the whole authority of the state
is based on the compliance with these unchristian demands 

the sovereign powers of the world have in the course of time been
brought into a position in which  for their own preservation  they
must require from all men actions which cannot be performed by men
who profess true christianity 

and therefore in our days every profession of true christianity 
by any individual man  strikes at the most essential power of the
state  and inevitably leads the way for the emancipation of all 

what importance  one might think  can one attach to such an
incident as some dozens of crazy fellows  as people will call
them  refusing to take the oath of allegiance to the government 
refusing to pay taxes  to take part in law proceedings or in
military service 

these people are punished and exiled to a distance  and life goes
on in its old way   one might think there was no importance in
such incidents  but yet  it is just those incidents  more than
anything else  that will undermine the power of the state and
prepare the way for the freedom of men   these are the individual
bees  who are beginning to separate from the swarm  and are flying
near it  waiting till the whole swarm can no longer be prevented
from starting off after them   and the governments know this  and
fear such incidents more than all the socialists  communists  and
anarchists  and their plots and dynamite bombs 

a new reign is beginning   according to the universal rule and
established order it is required that all the subjects should take
the oath of allegiance to the new government   there is a general
decree to that effect  and all are summoned to the councilhouses
to take the oath   all at once one man in perm  another in tula  a
third in moscow  and a fourth in kalouga declare that they will
not take the oath  and though there is no communication between
them  they all explain their refusal on the same groundsnamely 
that swearing is forbidden by the law of christ  and that even if
swearing had not been forbidden  they could not  in the spirit of
the law of christ  promise to perform the evil actions required of
them in the oath  such as informing against all such as may act
against the interests of the government  or defending their
government with firearms or attacking its enemies  they are
brought before rural police officers  district police captains 
priests  and governors  they are admonished  questioned 
threatened  and punished  but they adhere to their resolution  and
do not take the oath   and among the millions of those who did
take the oath  those dozens go on living who did not take the
oath   and they are questioned

what  didnt you take the oath 

no  i didnt take the oath 

and what happenednothing 

nothing 

the subjects of a state are all bound to pay taxes   and everyone
pays taxes  till suddenly one man in kharkov  another in tver  and
a third in samara refuse to pay taxesall  as though in
collusion  saying the same thing   one says he will only pay when
they tell him what object the money taken from him will be spent
on   if it is for good deeds  he says  he will give it of his
own accord  and more even than is required of him  if for evil
deeds  then he will give nothing voluntarily  because by the law
of christ  whose follower he is  he cannot take part in evil
deeds   the others  too  say the same in other words  and will
not voluntarily pay the taxes 

those who have anything to be taken have their property taken from
them by force  as for those who have nothing  they are left alone 

what  didnt you pay the tax 

no  i didnt pay it 

and what happenednothing 

nothing 

there is the institution of passports   everyone moving from his
place of residence is bound to carry one  and to pay a duty on it 
suddenly people are to be found in various places declaring that
to carry a passport is not necessary  that one ought not to
recognize ones dependence on a state which exists by means of
force  and these people do not carry passports  or pay the duty on
them   and again  its impossible to force those people by any
means to do what is required   they send them to jail  and let
them out again  and these people live without passports 

all peasants are bound to fill certain police officesthat of
village constable  and of watchman  and so on   suddenly in
kharkov a peasant refuses to perform this duty  justifying his
refusal on the ground that by the law of christ  of which he is a
follower  he cannot put any man in fetters  lock him up  or drag
him from place to place   the same declaration is made by a
peasant in tver  another in tambov   these peasants are abused 
beaten  shut up in prison  but they stick to their resolution and
dont fill these offices against their convictions   and at last
they cease to appoint them as constables   and again nothing
happens 

all citizens are obliged to take a share in law proceedings in the
character of jurymen  suddenly the most different peoplemechanics 
professors  tradesmen  peasants  servants  as though by agreement refuse
to fill this office  and not on the grounds allowed as sufficient by
law  but because any process at law is  according to their views 
unchristian  they fine these people  trying not to let them have an
opportunity of explaining their motives in public  and replace them by
others  and again nothing can be done 

all young men of twentyone years of age are obliged to draw lots
for service in the army  all at once one young man in moscow 
another in tver  a third in kharkov  and a fourth in kiev present
themselves before the authorities  and  as though by previous
agreement  declare that they will not take the oath  they will not
serve because they are christians   i will give the details of one
of the first cases  since they have become more frequent  which i
happen to know about footnote all the details of this case  as
well as those preceding it  are authentic   the same treatment
has been repeated in every other case   a young man of fair
education refuses in the moscow townhall to take the oath   no
attention is paid to what he says  and it is requested that he
should pronounce the words of the oath like the rest   he
declines  quoting a particular passage of the gospel in which
swearing is forbidden   no attention is paid to his arguments  and
he is again requested to comply with the order  but he does not
comply with it   then it is supposed that he is a sectary and
therefore does not understand christianity in the right sense 
that is to say  not in the sense in which the priests in the pay
of the government understand it   and the young man is conducted
under escort to the priests  that they may bring him to reason 
the priests begin to reason with him  but their efforts in
christs name to persuade him to renounce christ obviously have no
influence on him  he is pronounced incorrigible and sent back
again to the army   he persists in not taking the oath and openly
refuses to perform any military duties   it is a case that has not
been provided for by the laws   to overlook such a refusal to
comply with the demands of the authorities is out of the question 
but to put such a case on a par with simple breach of discipline
is also out of the question 

after deliberation among themselves  the military authorities
decide to get rid of the troublesome young man  to consider him as
a revolutionist  and they dispatch him under escort to the
committee of the secret police   the police authorities and
gendarmes crossquestion him  but nothing that he says can be
brought under the head of any of the misdemeanors which come under
their jurisdiction   and there is no possibility of accusing him
either of revolutionary acts or revolutionary plotting  since he
declares that he does not wish to attack anything  but  on the
contrary  is opposed to any use of force  and  far from plotting
in secret  he seeks every opportunity of saying and doing all that
he says and does in the most open manner   and the gendarmes 
though they are bound by no hardandfast rules  still find no
ground for a criminal charge in the young man  and  like the
clergy  they send him back to the army   again the authorities
deliberate together  and decide to accept him though he has not
taken the oath  and to enrol him among the soldiers   they put him
into the uniform  enrol him  and send him under guard to the place
where the army is quartered   there the chief officer of the
division which he enters again expects the young man to perform
his military duties  and again he refuses to obey  and in the
presence of other soldiers explains the reason of his refusal 
saying that he as a christian cannot voluntarily prepare himself
to commit murder  which is forbidden by the law of moses 

this incident occurs in a provincial town   the case awakens the
interest  and even the sympathy  not only of outsiders  but even
of the officers   and the chief officers consequently do not
decide to punish this refusal of obedience with disciplinary
measures   to save appearances  though  they shut the young man up
in prison  and write to the highest military authorities to
inquire what they are to do   to refuse to serve in the army  in
which the tzar himself serves  and which enjoys the blessing of
the church  seems insanity from the official point of view 
consequently they write from petersburg that  since the young man
must be out of his mind  they must not use any severe treatment
with him  but must send him to a lunatic asylum  that his mental
condition may be inquired into and be scientifically treated 
they send him to the asylum in the hope that he will remain there 
like another young man  who refused ten years ago at tver to serve
in the army  and who was tortured in the asylum till he submitted 
but even this step does not rid the military authorities of the
inconvenient man   the doctors examine him  interest themselves
warmly in his case  and naturally finding in him no symptoms of
mental disease  send him back to the army   there they receive
him  and making believe to have forgotten his refusal  and his
motives for it  they again request him to go to drill  and again
in the presence of the other soldiers he refuses and explains the
reason of his refusal   the affair continues to attract more and
more attention  both among the soldiers and the inhabitants of the
town   again they write to petersburg  and thence comes the decree
to transfer the young man to some division of the army stationed
on the frontier  in some place where the army is under martial
law  where he can be shot for refusing to obey  and where the
matter can proceed without attracting observation  seeing that
there are few russians and christians in such a distant part  but
the majority are foreigners and mohammedans   this is accordingly
done   they transfer him to a division stationed on the zacaspian
border  and in company with convicts send him to a chief officer
who is notorious for his harshness and severity 

all this time  through all these changes from place to place  the
young man is roughly treated  kept in cold  hunger  and filth  and
life is made burdensome to him generally   but all these
sufferings do not compel him to change his resolution   on the
zacaspian border  where he is again requested to go on guard fully
armed  he again declines to obey   he does not refuse to go and
stand near the haystacks where they place him  but refuses to take
his arms  declaring that he will not use violence in any case
against anyone   all this takes place in the presence of the other
soldiers   to let such a refusal pass unpunished is impossible 
and the young man is put on his trial for breach of discipline 
the trial takes place  and he is sentenced to confinement in the
military prison for two years   he is again transferred  in
company with convicts  by √©tape  to caucasus  and there he is shut
up in prison and falls under the irresponsible power of the
jailer   there he is persecuted for a year and a half  but he does
not for all that alter his decision not to bear arms  and he
explains why he will not do this to everyone with whom he is
brought in contact   at the end of the second year they set him
free  before the end of his term of imprisonment  reckoning it
contrary to law to keep him in prison after his time of military
service was over  and only too glad to get rid of him as soon as
possible 

other men in various parts of russia behave  as though by
agreement  precisely in the same way as this young man  and in all
these cases the government has adopted the same timorous 
undecided  and secretive course of action   some of these men are
sent to the lunatic asylum  some are enrolled as clerks and
transferred to siberia  some are sent to work in the forests  some
are sent to prison  some are fined   and at this very time some
men of this kind are in prison  not charged with their real
offensethat is  denying the lawfulness of the action of the
government  but for nonfulfillment of special obligations imposed
by government   thus an officer of reserve  who did not report his
change of residence  and justified this on the ground that he
would not serve in the army any longer  was fined thirty rubles
for noncompliance with the orders of the superior authority 
this fine he also declined voluntarily to pay   in the same way
some peasants and soldiers who have refused to be drilled and to
bear arms have been placed under arrest on a charge of breach of
discipline and insolence 

and cases of refusing to comply with the demands of government when they
are opposed to christianity  and especially cases of refusing to serve
in the army  are occurring of late not in russia only  but everywhere 
thus i happen to know that in servia men of the socalled sect of
nazarenes steadily refuse to serve in the army  and the austrian
government has been carrying on a fruitless contest with them for years 
punishing them with imprisonment  in the year 1885 there were 130 such
cases  i know that in switzerland in the year 1890 there were men in
prison in the castle of chillon for declining to serve in the army 
whose resolution was not shaken by their punishment  there have been
such cases in sweden  and the men who refused obedience were sent to
prison in exactly the same way  and the government studiously concealed
these cases from the people  there have been similar cases also in
prussi  i know of the case of a sublieutenant of the guards  who in
1891 declared to the authorities in berlin that he would not  as a
christian  continue to serve  and in spite of all admonitions  threats 
and punishments he stuck to his resolution  in the south of france a
society has arisen of late bearing the name of the hinschists these
facts are taken from the peace herald  july  1891  the members of which
refuse to enter military service on the grounds of their christian
principles  at first they were enrolled in the ambulance corps  but now 
as their numbers increase  they are subjected to punishment for
noncompliance  but they still refuse to bear arms just the same 

the socialists  the communists  the anarchists  with their bombs
and riots and revolutions  are not nearly so much dreaded by
governments as these disconnected individuals coming from
different parts  and all justifying their noncompliance on the
grounds of the same religion  which is known to all the world 
every government knows by what means and in what manner to defend
itself from revolutionists  and has resources for doing so  and
therefore does not dread these external foes   but what are
governments to do against men who show the uselessness 
superfluousness  and perniciousness of  all governments  and who
do  not contend against them  but simply do not need them and do
without them  and therefore are unwilling to take any part in
them   the revolutionists say the form of government is bad in
this respect and that respect  we must overturn it and substitute
this or that form of government   the christian says i know
nothing about the form of government  i dont know whether it is
good or bad  and i dont want to overturn it precisely because i
dont know whether it is good or bad  but for the very same reason
i dont want to support it either   and i  not only dont want to 
but i cant  because what it demands of me is against my
conscience 

all state obligations are against the conscience of a christianthe
oath of allegiance  taxes  law proceedings  and military service  and
the whole power of the government rests on these very obligations 

revolutionary enemies attack the government from without 
christianity does not attack it at all  but  from within  it
destroys all the foundations on which government rests 

among the russian people  especially since the age of peter i   the
protest of christianity against the government has never ceased  and the
social organization has been such that men emigrate in communes to
turkey  to china  and to uninhabited lands  and not only feel no need of
state aid  but always regard the state as a useless burden  only to be
endured as a misfortune  whether it happens to be turkish  russian  or
chinese  and so  too  among the russian people more and more frequent
examples have of late appeared of conscious christian freedom from
subjection to the state  and these examples are the more alarming for
the government from the fact that these noncompliant persons often
belong not to the socalled lower uneducated classes  but are men of
fair or good education  and also from the fact that they do not in these
days justify their position by any mystic and exceptional views  as in
former times  do not associate themselves with any superstitious or
fanatic rites  like the sects who practice selfimmolation by fire  or
the wandering pilgrims  but put their refusal on the very simplest and
clearest grounds  comprehensible to all  and recognized as true by all 

thus they refuse the voluntary payment of taxes  because taxes are spent
on deeds of violenceon the pay of men of violencesoldiers  on the
construction of prisons  fortresses  and cannons  they as christians
regard it as sinful and immoral to have any hand in such deeds 

those who refuse to take the oath of allegiance refuse because to
promise obedience to authorities  that is  to men who are given to
deeds of violence  is contrary to the sense of christs teaching 
they refuse to take the oath in the law courts  because oaths are
directly forbidden by the gospel   they refuse to perform police
duties  because in the performance of these duties they must use
force against their brothers and ill treat them  and a christian
cannot do that   they refuse to take part in trials at law 
because they consider every appeal to law is fulfilling the law of
vengeance  which is inconsistent with the christian law of
forgiveness and love   they refuse to take any part in military
preparations and in the army  because they cannot be executioners 
and they are unwilling to prepare themselves to be so 

the motives in all these cases are so excellent that  however
despotic governments may be  they could hardly punish them openly 
to punish men for refusing to act against their conscience the
government must renounce all claim to good sense and benevolence 
and they assure people that they only rule in the name of good
sense and benevolence 

what are governments to do against such people 

governments can of course flog to death or execute or keep in
perpetual imprisonment all enemies who want to overturn them by
violence  they can lavish gold on that section of the people who
are ready to destroy their enemies   but what can they do against
men who  without wishing to overturn or destroy anything  desire
simply for their part to do nothing against the law of christ  and
who  therefore  refuse to perform the commonest state
requirements  which are  therefore  the most indispensable to the
maintenance of the state 

if they had been revolutionists  advocating and practicing
violence and murder  their suppression would have been an easy
matter  some of them could have been bought over  some could have
been duped  some could have been overawed  and these who could not
be bought over  duped  or overawed would have been treated as
criminals  enemies of society  would have been executed or
imprisoned  and the crowd would have approved of the action of the
government   if they had been fanatics  professing some peculiar
belief  it might have been possible  in disproving the
superstitious errors mixed in with their religion  to attack also
the truth they advocate   but what is to be done with men who
profess no revolutionary ideas nor any peculiar religious dogmas 
but merely because they are unwilling to do evil to any man 
refuse to take the oath  to pay taxes  to take part in law
proceedings  to serve in the army  to fulfill  in fact  any of the
obligations upon which the whole fabric of a state rests   what is
to done with such people   to buy them over with bribes is
impossible  the very risks to which they voluntarily expose
themselves show that they are incorruptible   to dupe them into
believing that this is their duty to god is also impossible  since
their refusal is based on the clear  unmistakable law of god 
recognized even by those who are trying to compel men to act
against it   to terrify them by threats is still less possible 
because the deprivations and sufferings to which they are
subjected only strengthen their desire to follow the faith by
which they are commanded to obey god rather than men  and not to
fear those who can destroy the body  but to fear him who can
destroy body and soul   to kill them or keep them in perpetual
imprisonment is also impossible   these men have friends  and a
past  their way of thinking and acting is well known  they are
known by everyone for good  gentle  peaceable people  and they
cannot be regarded as criminals who must be removed for the safety
of society   and to put men to death who are regarded as good men
is to provoke others to champion them and justify their refusal 
and it is only necessary to explain the reasons of their refusal
to make clear to everyone that these reasons have the same force
for all other men  and that they all ought to have done the same
long ago   these cases put the ruling powers into a desperate
position   they see that the prophecy of christianity is coming to
pass  that it is loosening the fetters of those in chains  and
setting free them that are in bondage  and that this must
inevitably be the end of all oppressors   the ruling authorities
see this  they know that their hours are numbered  and they can do
nothing   all that they can do to save themselves is only
deferring the hour of their downfall   and this they do  but their
position is none the less desperate 

it is like the position of a conqueror who is trying to save a
town which has been been set on fire by its own inhabitants 
directly he puts out the conflagration in one place  it is alight
in two other places  directly he gives in to the fire and cuts off
what is on fire from a large building  the building itself is
alight at both ends   these separate fires may be few  but they
are burning with a flame which  however small a spark it starts
from  never ceases till it has set the whole ablaze 

thus it is that the ruling authorities are in such a defenseless
position before men who advocate christianity  that but little is
necessary to overthrow this sovereign power which seems so
powerful  and has held such an exalted position for so many
centuries   and yet social reformers are busy promulgating the
idea that it is not necessary and is even pernicious and immoral
for every man separately to work out his own freedom   as though 
while one set of men have been at work a long while turning a
river into a new channel  and had dug out a complete watercourse
and had only to open the floodgates for the water to rush in and
do the rest  another set of men should come along and begin to
advise them that it would be much better  instead of letting the
water out  to construct a machine which would ladle the water up
from one side and pour it over the other side 

but the thing has gone too far   already ruling governments feel
their weak and defenseless position  and men of christian
principles are awakening from their apathy  and already begin to
feel their power 

i am come to send a fire on the earth  said christ  and what
will i  if it be already kindled 

and this fire is beginning to burn 




chapter x 

evil  cannot be suppressed by the physical force of the
governmentthe moral progress of humanity is brought about not
only by individual recognition of truth  but also through the
establishment of a public opinion 

christianity destroys the statebut which is most necessary
christianity or the state there are some who assert the necessity of a
state organization  and others who deny it  both arguing from same first
principlesneither contention can be proved by abstract argumentthe
question must be decided by the stage in the development of conscience
of each man  which will either prevent or allow him to support a
government organizationrecognition of the futility and immorality of
supporting a state organization contrary to christian principles will
decide the question for every man  in spite of any action on part of the
stateargument of those who defend the government  that it is a form of
social life  needed to protect the good from the wicked  till all
nations and all members of each nation have become christiansthe most
wicked are always those in powerthe whole history of humanity is the
history of the forcible appropriation of power by the wicked and their
oppression of the goodthe recognition by governments of the necessity
of opposing evil by force is equivalent to suicide on their partthe
abolition of stateviolence cannot increase the sum total of acts of
violencethe suppression of the use of force is not only possible  but
is even taking place before our eyesbut it will never be suppressed by
the violence of government  but through men who have attained power by
evidence recognizing its emptiness and becoming better and less capable
of using forceindividual men and also whole nations pass through this
processby this means christianity is diffused through consciousness of
men  not only in spite of use of violence by government  but even
through its action  and therefore the suppression is not to be dreaded 
but is brought about by the national progress of lifeobjection of
those who defend state organization that universal adoption of
christianity is hardly likely to be realized at any timethe general
adoption of the truths of christianity is being brought about not only
by the gradual and inward means  that is  by knowledge of the truth 
prophetic insight  and recognition of the emptiness of power  and
renunciation of it by individuals  but also by another external means 
the acceptance of a new truth by whole masses of men on a lower level of
development through simple confidence in their leaderswhen a certain
stage in the diffusion of a truth has been reached  a public opinion is
created which impels a whole mass of men  formerly antagonistic to the
new truth  to accept itand therefore all men may quickly be brought to
renounce the use of violence when once a christian public opinion is
establishedthe conviction of force being necessary hinders the
establishment of a christian public opinionthe use of violence leads
men to distrust the spiritual force which is the only force by which
they advanceneither nations nor individuals have been really
subjugated by force  but only by public opinion  which no force can
resistsavage nations and savage men can only be subdued by the
diffusion of a christian standard among them  while actually christian
nations in order to subdue them do all they can to destroy a christian
standardthese fruitless attempts to civilize savages cannot be adduced
as proofs that men cannot be subdued by christianityviolence by
corrupting public opinion  only hinders the social organization from
being what it ought to beand by the use of violence being suppressed 
a christian public opinion would be establishedwhatever might be the
result of the suppression of use of force  this unknown future could not
be worse than the present condition  and so there is no need to dread
itto attain knowledge of the unknown  and to move toward it  is the
essence of life 


christianity in its true sense puts an end to government   so it
was understood at its very commencement  it was for that cause
that christ was crucified   so it has always been understood by
people who were not under the necessity of justifying a christian
government   only from the time that the heads of government
assumed an external and nominal christianity  men began to invent
all the impossible  cunningly devised theories by means of which
christianity can be reconciled with government   but no honest and
seriousminded man of our day can help seeing the incompatibility
of true christianitythe doctrine of meekness  forgiveness of
injuries  and lovewith government  with its pomp  acts of
violence  executions  and wars   the profession of true
christianity not only excludes the possibility of recognizing
government  but even destroys its very foundations 

but if it is so  and we are right in saying that christianity is
incompatible with government  then the question naturally presents
itself which is more necessary to the good of humanity  in which
way is mens happiness best to be secured  by maintaining the
organization of government or by destroying it and replacing it by
christianity 

some people maintain that government is more necessary for
humanity  that the destruction of the state organization would
involve the destruction of all that humanity has gained  that the
state has been and still is the only form in which humanity can
develop   the evil which we see among peoples living under a
government organization they attribute not to that type of
society  but to its abuses  which  they say  can be corrected
without destroying it  and thus humanity  without discarding the
state organization  can develop and attain a high degree of
happiness  and men of this way of thinking bring forward in
support of their views arguments which they think irrefutable
drawn from history  philosophy  and even religion   but there are
men who hold on the contrary that  as there was a time when
humanity lived without government  such an organization is
temporary  and that a time must come when men need a new
organization  and that that time has come now   and men of this
way of thinking also bring forward in support of their views
arguments which they think irrefutable from philosophy  history 
and religion 

volumes may be written in defense of the former view and volumes
indeed have long ago been written and more will still be written
on that side  but much also can be written against it and much
also  and most brilliantly  has been writtenthough more recently
on this side 

and it cannot be proved  as the champions of the state maintain 
that the destruction of government involves a social chaos  mutual
spoliation and murder  the destruction of all social institutions 
and the return of mankind to barbarism   nor can it be proved as
the opponents of government maintain that men have already become
so wise and good that they will not spoil or murder one another 
but will prefer peaceful associations to hostilities  that of
their own accord  unaided by the state  they will make all the
arrangements that they need  and that therefore government  far
from being any aid  under show of guarding men exerts a pernicious
and brutalizing influence over them   it is impossible to prove
either of these contentions by abstract reasoning   still less
possible is it to prove them by experiment  since the whole matter
turns on the question  ought we to try the experiment   the
question whether or not the time has come to make an end of
government would be unanswerable  except that there exists another
living means of settling it beyond dispute 

we may dispute upon the question whether the nestlings are ready
to do without the motherhen and to come out of the eggs  or
whether they are not yet advanced enough   but the young birds
will decide the question without any regard for our arguments when
they find themselves cramped for space in the eggs   then they
will begin to try them with their beaks and come out of them of
their own accord 

it is the same with the question whether the time has come to do
away with the governmental type of society and to replace it by a
new type   if a man  through the growth of a higher conscience 
can no longer comply with the demands of government  he finds
himself cramped by it and at the same time no longer needs its
protection   when this comes to pass  the question whether men are
ready to discard the governmental type is solved   and the
conclusion will be as final for them as for the young birds
hatched out of the eggs   just as no power in the world can put
them back into the shells  so can no power in the world bring men
again under the governmental type of society when once they have
outgrown it 

it may well be that government was necessary and is still
necessary for all the advantages which you attribute to it  says
the man who has mastered the christian theory of life  i only
know that on the one hand  government is no longer necessary for
me  and on the other hand  i can no longer carry out the measures
that are necessary to the existence of a government   settle for
yourselves what you need for your life   i cannot prove the need
or the harm of governments in general   i know only what i need
and do not need  what i can do and what i cannot   i know that i
do not need to divide myself off from other nations  and therefore
i cannot admit that i belong exclusively to any state or nation 
or that i owe allegiance to any government   i know that i do not
need all the government institutions organized within the state 
and therefore i cannot deprive people who need my labor to give it
in the form of taxes to institutions which i do not need  which
for all i know may be pernicious   i know that i have no need of
the administration or of courts of justice founded upon force  and
therefore i can take no part in either   i know that i do not need
to attack and slaughter other nations or to defend myself from
them with arms  and therefore i can take no part in wars or
preparations for wars   it may well be that there are people who
cannot help regarding all this as necessary and indispensable   i
cannot dispute the question with them  i can only speak for
myself  but i can say with absolute certainty that i do not need
it  and that i cannot do it   and i do not need this and i cannot
do it  not because such is my own  my personal will  but because
such is the will of him who sent me into life  and gave me an
indubitable law for my conduct through life 

whatever arguments may be advanced in support of the contention
that the suppression of government authority would be injurious
and would lead to great calamities  men who have once outgrown the
governmental form of society cannot go back to it again   and all
the reasoning in the world cannot make the man who has outgrown
the governmental form of society take part in actions disallowed
by his conscience  any more than the fullgrown bird can be made
to return into the eggshell 

but even it be so  say the champions of the existing order of
things  still the suppression of government violence can only be
possible and desirable when all men have become christians   so
long as among people nominally christians there are unchristian
wicked men  who for the gratification of their own lusts are ready
to do harm to others  the suppression of government authority  far
from being a blessing to others  would only increase their
miseries   the suppression of the governmental type of society is
not only undesirable so long as there is only a minority of true
christians  it would not even be desirable if the whole of a
nation were christians  but among and around them were still
unchristian men of other nations   for these unchristian men would
rob  outrage  and kill the christians with impunity and would make
their lives miserable   all that would result  would be that the
bad would oppress and outrage the good with impunity   and
therefore the authority of government must not be suppressed till
all the wicked and rapacious people in the world are extinct   and
since this will either never be  or at least cannot be for a long
time to come  in spite of the efforts of individual christians to
be independent of government authority  it ought to be maintained
in the interests of the majority   the champions of government
assert that without it the wicked will oppress and outrage the
good  and that the power of the government enables the good to
resist the wicked 

but in this assertion the champions of the existing order of
things take for granted the proposition they want to prove   when
they say that except for the government the bad would oppress the
good  they take it for granted that the good are those who at the
present time are in possession of power  and the bad are those who
are in subjection to it   but this is just what wants proving   it
would only be true if the custom of our society were what is  or
rather is supposed to be  the custom in china  that is  that the
good always rule  and that directly those at the head of
government cease to be better than those they rule over  the
citizens are bound to remove them   this is supposed to be the
custom in chin   in reality it is not so and can never be so 
for to remove the heads of a government ruling by force  it is not
the right alone  but the power to do so that is needed   so that
even in china this is only an imaginary custom   and in our
christian world we do not even suppose such a custom  and we have
nothing on which to build up the supposition that it is the good
or the superior who are in power  in reality it is those who have
seized power and who keep it for their own and their retainers
benefit 

the good cannot seize power  nor retain it  to do this men must
love power   and love of power is inconsistent with goodness  but
quite consistent with the very opposite qualitiespride  cunning 
cruelty 

without the aggrandizement of self and the abasement of others 
without hypocrisies and deceptions  without prisons  fortresses 
executions  and murders  no power can come into existence or be
maintained 

if the power of government is suppressed the more wicked will
oppress the less wicked  say the champions of state authority 
but when the egyptians conquered the jews  the romans conquered
the greeks  and the barbarians conquered the romans  is it
possible that all the conquerors were always better than those
they conquered   and the same with the transitions of power within
a state from one personage to another has the power always passed
from a worse person to a better one   when louis xvi  was removed
and robespierre came to power  and afterward napoleonwho ruled
then  a better man or a worse   and when were better men in power 
when the versaillist party or when the commune was in power   when
charles i  was ruler  or when cromwell   and when peter iii  was
tzar  or when he was killed and catherine was tzaritsa in onehalf
of russia and pougachef ruled the other   which was bad then  and
which was good   all men who happen to be in authority assert that
their authority is necessary to keep the bad from oppressing the
good  assuming that they themselves are the good par excellence 
who protect other good people from the bad 

but ruling means using force  and using force means doing to him to whom
force is used  what he does not like and what he who uses the force
would certainly not like done to himself  consequently ruling means
doing to others what we would not they should do unto us  that is  doing
wrong 


to submit means to prefer suffering to using force   and to prefer
suffering to using force means to be good  or at least less wicked
than those who do unto others what they would not like themselves 

and therefore  in all probability  not the better but the worse
have always ruled and are ruling now   there may be bad men among
those who are ruled  but it cannot be that those who are better
have generally ruled those who are worse 

it might be possible to suppose this with the inexact heathen
definition of good  but with the clear christian definition of
good and evil  it is impossible to imagine it 

if the more or less good  and the more or less bad cannot be
distinguished in the heathen world  the christian conception of
good and evil has so clearly defined the characteristics of the
good and the wicked  that it is impossible to confound them 
according to christs teaching the good are those who are meek and
longsuffering  do not resist evil by force  forgive injuries  and
love their enemies  those are wicked who exalt themselves 
oppress  strive  and use force   therefore by christs teaching
there can be no doubt whether the good are to be found among
rulers or ruled  and whether the wicked are among the ruled or the
rulers   indeed it is absurd even to speak of christians ruling 

nonchristians  that is those who find the aim of their lives in
earthly happiness  must always rule christians  the aim of whose
lives is the renunciation of such earthly happiness 

this difference has always existed and has become more and more
defined as the christian religion has been more widely diffused
and more correctly understood 

the more widely true christianity was diffused and the more it
penetrated mens conscience  the more impossible it was for
christians to be rulers  and the easier it became for nonchristians
to rule them 

to get rid of governmental violence in a society in which all are
not true christians  will only result in the wicked dominating the
good and oppressing them with impunity  say the champions of the
existing order of things  but it has never been  and cannot be
otherwise   so it has always been from the beginning of the world 
and so it is still   the wicked will always dominate the good  and
will always oppress them   cain overpowered abel  the cunning
jacob oppressed the guileless esau and was in his turn deceived by
laban  caiaphas and pilate oppressed christ  the roman emperors
oppressed seneca  epictetus  and the good romans who lived in
their times   john iv  with his favorites  the syphilitic drunken
peter with his buffoons  the vicious catherine with her paramours 
ruled and oppressed the industrious religious russians of their
times 

william is ruling over the germans  stambouloff over the
bulgarians  the russian officials over the russian people   the
germans have dominated the italians  now they dominate the
hungarians and slavonians  the turks have dominated and still
dominate the slavonians and greeks  the english dominate the
hindoos  the mongolians dominate the chinese 

so that whether governmental violence is suppressed or not  the
position of good men  in being oppressed by the wicked  will be
unchanged 

to terrify men with the prospect of the wicked dominating the good
is impossible  for that is just what has always been  and is now 
and cannot but be 

the whole history of pagan times is nothing but a recital of the
incidents and means by which the more wicked gained possession of
power over the less wicked  and retained it by cruelties and
deceptions  ruling over the good under the pretense of guarding
the right and protecting the good from the wicked   all the
revolutions in history are only examples of the more wicked
seizing power and oppressing the good   in declaring that if their
authority did not exist the more wicked would oppress the good 
the ruling authorities only show their disinclination to let other
oppressors come to power who would like to snatch it from them 

but in asserting this they only accuse themselves  say that their
power  i  e   violence  is needed to defend men from other
possible oppressors in the present or the future see footnote 

    footnote i may quote in this connection the amazingly
    naive and comic declaration of the russian authorities 
    the oppressors of other nationalitiesthe poles  the
    germans of the baltic provinces  and the jews   the
    russian government has oppressed its subjects for
    centuries  and has never troubled itself about the
    little russians of poland  or the letts of the baltic
    provinces  or the russian peasants  exploited by everyone 
    and now it has all of a sudden become the champion of
    the oppressedthe very oppressed whom it is itself
    oppressing 

the weakness of the use of violence lies in the fact that all the
arguments brought forward by oppressors in their own defense can
with even better reason be advanced against them   they plead the
danger of violencemost often imagined in the futurebut they
are all the while continuing to practice actual violence
themselves   you say that men used to pillage and murder in the
past  and that you are afraid that they will pillage and murder
one another if your power were no more   that may happenor it
may not happen   but the fact that you ruin thousands of men in
prisons  fortresses  galleys  and exile  break up millions of
families and ruin millions of men  physically as well as morally 
in the army  that fact is not an imaginary but a real act of
violence  which  according to your own argument  one ought to
oppose by violence   and so you are yourselves these wicked men
against whom  according to your own argument  it is absolutely
necessary to use violence  the oppressed are sure to say to their
oppressors   and nonchristian men always do say  and think and
act on this reasoning   if the oppressed are more wicked than
their oppressors  they attack them and try to overthrow them  and
in favorable circumstances they succeed in overthrowing them  or
what is more common  they rise into the ranks of the oppressors
and assist in their acts of violence 

so that the very violence which the champions of government hold
up as a terrorpretending that except for its oppressive power
the wicked would oppress the goodhas really always existed and
will exist in human society   and therefore the suppression of
state violence cannot in any case be the cause of increased
oppression of the good by the wicked 

if state violence ceased  there would be acts of violence perhaps
on the part of different people  other than those who had done
deeds of violence before   but the total amount of violence could
not in any case be increased by the mere fact of power passing
from one set of men to another 

state violence can only cease when there are no more wicked men
in society  say the champions of the existing order of things 
assuming in this of course that since there will always be wicked
men  it can never cease   and that would be right enough if it
were the case  as they assume  that the oppressors are always the
best of men  and that the sole means of saving men from evil is by
violence   then  indeed  violence could never cease   but since
this is not the case  but quite the contrary  that it is not the
better oppress the worse  but the worse oppress the better  and
since violence will never put an end to evil  and there is 
moreover  another means of putting an end to it  the assertion
that violence will never cease is incorrect   the use of violence
grows less and less and evidently must disappear   but this will
not come to pass  as some champions of the existing order imagine 
through the oppressed becoming better and better under the
influence of government on the contrary  its influence causes
their continual degradation  but through the fact that all men
are constantly growing better and better of themselves  so that
even the most wicked  who are in power  will become less and less
wicked  till at last they are so good as to be incapable of using
violence 

the progressive movement of humanity does not proceed from the
better elements in society seizing power and making those who are
subject to them better  by forcible means  as both conservatives
and revolutionists imagine   it proceeds first and principally
from the fact that all men in general are advancing steadily and
undeviatingly toward a more and more conscious assimilation of the
christian theory of life  and secondly  from the fact that  even
apart from conscious spiritual life  men are unconsciously brought
into a more christian attitude to life by the very process of one
set of men grasping the power  and again being replaced by others 

the worse elements of society  gaining possession of power  under the
sobering influence which always accompanies power  grow less and less
cruel  and become incapable of using cruel forms of violence 
consequently others are able to seize their place  and the same process
of softening and  so to say  unconscious christianizing goes on with
them  it is something like the process of ebullition  the majority of
men  having the nonchristian view of life  always strive for power and
struggle to obtain it  in this struggle the most cruel  the coarsest 
the least christian elements of society overpower the most gentle 
welldisposed  and christian  and rise by means of their violence to the
upper ranks of society  and in them is christs prophecy fulfilled woe
to you that are rich  woe unto you that are full  woe unto you when all
men shall speak well of you  for the men who are in possession of power
and all that results from itglory and wealthand have attained the
various aims they set before themselves  recognize the vanity of it all
and return to the position from which they came  charles v   john iv  
alexander i   recognizing the emptiness and the evil of power  renounced
it because they were incapable of using violence for their own benefit
as they had done 

but they are not the solitary examples of this recognition of the
emptiness and evil of power  everyone who gains a position of
power he has striven for  every general  every minister  every
millionaire  every petty official who has gained the place he has
coveted for ten years  every rich peasant who has laid by some
hundred rubles  passes through this unconscious process of
softening 

and not only individual men  but societies of men  whole nations 
pass through this process 

the seductions of power  and all the wealth  honor  and luxury it
gives  seem a sufficient aim for mens efforts only so long as
they are unattained   directly a man reaches them he sees all
their vanity  and they gradually lose all their power of
attraction   they are like clouds which have form and beauty only
from the distance  directly one ascends into them  all their
splendor vanishes 

men who are in possession of power and wealth  sometimes even
those who have gained for themselves their power and wealth  but
more often their heirs  cease to be so eager for power  and so
cruel in their efforts to obtain it 

having learnt by experience  under the operation of christian
influence  the vanity of all that is gained by violence  men
sometimes in one  sometimes in several generations lose the vices
which are generated by the passion for power and wealth   they
become less cruel and so cannot maintain their position  and are
expelled from power by others less christian and more wicked 
thus they return to a rank of society lower in position  but
higher in morality  raising thereby the average level of christian
consciousness in men   but directly after them again the worst 
coarsest  least christian elements of society rise to the top  and
are subjected to the same process as their predecessors  and again
in a generation or so  seeing the vanity of what is gained by
violence  and having imbibed christianity  they come down again
among the oppressed  and their place is again filled by new
oppressors  less brutal than former oppressors  though more so
than those they oppress   so that  although power remains
externally the same as it was  with every change of the men in
power there is a constant increase of the number of men who have
been brought by experience to the necessity of assimilating the
christian conception of life  and with every changethough it is
the coarsest  crudest  and least christian who come into
possession of power  they are less coarse and cruel and more
christian than their predecessors when they gained possession of
power 

power selects and attracts the worst elements of society 
transforms them  improves and softens them  and returns them to
society 

such is the process by means of which christianity  in spite of
the hindrances to human progress resulting from the violence of
power  gains more and more hold of men   christianity penetrates
to the consciousness of men  not only in spite of the violence of
power  but also by means of it 

and therefore the assertion of the champions of the state  that if
the power of government were suppressed the wicked would oppress
the good  not only fails to show that that is to be dreaded  since
it is just what happens now  but proves  on the contrary  that it
is governmental power which enables the wicked to oppress the
good  and is the evil most desirable to suppress  and that it is
being gradually suppressed in the natural course of things 

but if it be true that governmental power will disappear when
those in power become so christian that they renounce power of
their own accord  and there are no men found willing to take their
place  and even if this process is already going on  say the
champions of the existing order  when will that come to pass 
if  after eighteen hundred years  there are still so many eager
for power  and so few anxious to obey  there seems no likelihood
of its happening very soonor indeed of its ever happening at
all 

even if there are  as there have always been  some men who prefer
renouncing power to enjoying it  the mass of men in reserve  who
prefer dominion to subjection  is so great that it is difficult to
imagine a time when the number will be exhausted 

before this christianizing process could so affect all men one
after another that they would pass from the heathen to the
christian conception of life  and would voluntarily abandon power
and wealth  it would be necessary that all the coarse  halfsavage
men  completely incapable of appreciating christianity or acting
upon it  of whom there are always a great many in every christian
society  should be converted to christianity   more than this  all
the savage and absolutely nonchristian peoples  who are so
numerous outside the christian world  must also be converted   and
therefore  even if we admit that this christianizing process will
some day affect everyone  still  judging by the amount of progress
it has made in eighteen hundred years  it will be many times
eighteen centuries before it will do so   and it is therefore
impossible and unprofitable to think at present of anything so
impracticable as the suppression of authority   we ought only to
try to put authority into the best hands 

and this criticism would be perfectly just  if the transition from
one conception of life to another were only accomplished by the
single process of all men  separately and successively  realizing 
each for himself  the emptiness of power  and reaching christian
truth by the inner spiritual path   that process goes on
unceasingly  and men are passing over to christianity one after
another by this inner way 

but there is also another external means by which men reach
christianity and by which the transition is less gradual 

this transition from one organization of life to another is not
accomplished by degrees like the sand running through the
hourglass grain after grain   it is more like the water filling a
vessel floating on water  at first the water only runs in slowly
on one side  but as the vessel grows heavier it suddenly begins to
sink  and almost instantaneously fills with water 

it is just the same with the transitions of mankind from one
conceptionand so from one organization of lifeto another   at
first only gradually and slowly  one after another  men attain to
the new truth by the inner spiritual way  and follow it out in
life   but when a certain point in the diffusion of the truth has
been reached  it is suddenly assimilated by everyone  not by the
inner way  but  as it were  involuntarily 

that is why the champions of the existing order are wrong in
arguing that  since only a small section of mankind has passed
over to christianity in eighteen centuries  it must be many times
eighteen centuries before all the remainder do the same   for in
that argument they do not take into account any other means 
besides the inward spiritual one  by which men assimilate a new
truth and pass from one order of life to another 

men do not only assimilate a truth through recognizing it by
prophetic insight  or by experience of life   when the truth has
become sufficiently widely diffused  men at a lower stage of
development accept it all at once simply through confidence in
those who have reached it by the inner spiritual way  and are
applying it to life 

every new truth  by which the order of human life is changed and
humanity is advanced  is at first accepted by only a very small
number of men who understand it through inner spiritual intuition 
the remainder of mankind who accepted on trust the preceding truth
on which the existing order is based  are always opposed to the
diffusion of the new truth 

but seeing that  to begin with  men do not stand still  but are
steadily advancing to a greater recognition of the truth and a
closer adaptation of their life to it  and secondly  all men in
varying degrees according to their age  their education  and their
race are capable of understanding the new truths  at first those
who are nearest to the men who have attained the new truth by
spiritual intuition  slowly and one by one  but afterward more and
more quickly  pass over to the new truth   thus the number of men
who accept the new truth becomes greater and greater  and the
truth becomes more and more comprehensible 

and thus more confidence is aroused in the remainder  who are at a
less advanced stage of capacity for understanding the truth   and
it becomes easier for them to grasp it  and an increasing number
accept it 

and so the movement goes on more and more quickly  and on an
everincreasing scale  like a snowball  till at last a public opinion in
harmony with the new truth is created  and then the whole mass of men is
carried over all at once by its momentum to the new truth and
establishes a new social order in accordance with it 

those men who accept a new truth when it has gained a certain
degree of acceptance  always pass over all at once in masses 
they are like the ballast with which every ship is always loaded 
at once to keep it upright and enable it to sail properly   if
there were no ballast  the ship would not be low enough in the
water  and would shift its position at the slightest change in its
conditions   this ballast  which strikes one at first as
superfluous and even as hindering the progress of the vessel  is
really indispensable to its good navigation 

it is the same with the mass of mankind  who not individually  but
always in a mass  under the influence of a new social idea pass
all at once from one organization of life to another   this mass
always hinders  by its inertia  frequent and rapid revolutions in
the social order which have not been sufficiently proved by human
experience   and it delays every truth a long while till it has
stood the test of prolonged struggles  and has thoroughly
permeated the consciousness of humanity 

and that is why it is a mistake to say that because only a very
small minority of men has assimilated christianity in eighteen
centuries  it must take many times as many centuries for all
mankind to assimilate it  and that since that time is so far off
we who live in the present need not even think about it   it is a
mistake  because the men at a lower stage of culture  the  men and
the nations who are represented as the obstacle to the realization
of the christian order of life  are the very people who always
pass over in masses all at once to any truth that has once been
recognized by public opinion 

and therefore the transformation of human life  through which men
in power will renounce it  and there will be none anxious to take
their place  will not come only by all men consciously and
separately assimilating the christian conception of life  it will
come when a christian public opinion has arisen  so definite and
easily comprehensible as to reach the whole of the inert mass 
which is not able to attain truth by its own intuition  and
therefore is always under the sway of public opinion 

public opinion arises spontaneously and spreads for hundreds and
thousands of years  but it has the power of working on men by
infection  and with great rapidity gains a hold on great numbers
of men 

but  say the champions of the existing order  even if it is
true that public opinion  when it has attained a certain degree of
definiteness and precision  can convert the inert mass of men
outside the christian worldthe nonchristian racesas well as
the coarse and depraved who are living in its midst  what proofs
have we that this christian public opinion has arisen and is able
to replace force and render it unnecessary 

we must not give up force  by which the existing order is
maintained  and by relying on the vague and impalpable influence
of public opinion expose christians to the risk of being pillaged 
murdered  and outraged in every way by the savages inside and
outside of civilized society 

since  even supported by the use of force  we can hardly control
the nonchristian elements which are always ready to pour down on
us and to destroy all that has been gained by civilization  is it
likely that public opinion could take the place of force and
render us secure   and besides  how are we to find the moment when
public opinion has become strong enough to be able to replace the
use of force   to reject the use of force and trust to public
opinion to defend us would be as insane as to remove all weapons
of defense in a menagerie  and then to let loose all the lions and
tigers  relying on the fact that the animals seemed peaceable when
kept in their cages and held in check by redhot irons   and
therefore people in power  who have been put in positions of
authority by fate or by god  have not the right to run the risk 
ruining all that has been gained by civilization  just because
they want to try an experiment to see whether public opinion is or
is not able to replace the protection given by authority 

a french writer  forgotten now  alphonse karr  said somewhere 
trying to show the impossibility of doing away with the death
penalty que messieurs les assassins commencent par nous donner
lexemple   often have i heard this bon mot repeated by men who
thought that these words were a witty and convincing argument
against the abolition of capital punishment   and yet all the
erroneousness of the argument of those who consider that
governments cannot give up the use of force till all people are
capable of doing the same  could not be more clearly expressed
than it is in that epigram 

let the murderers  say the champions of state violence  set us
the example by giving up murder and then we will give it up   but
the murderers say just the same  only with much more right  they
say let those who have undertaken to teach us and guide us set
us the example of giving up legal murder  and then we will imitate
them   and they say this  not as a jest  but seriously  because
it is the actual state of the case 

we cannot give up the use of violence  because we are surrounded
by violent ruffians   nothing in our days hinders the progress of
humanity and the establishment of the organization corresponding
to its present development more than this false reasoning   those
in authority are convinced that men are only guided and only
progress through the use of force  and therefore they confidently
make use of it to support the existing organization   the existing
order is maintained  not by force  but by public opinion  the
action of which is disturbed by the use of force   so that the
effect of using force is to disturb and to weaken the very thing
it tries to maintain 

violence  even in the most favorable case  when it is not used
simply for some personal aims of those in power  always punishes
under the one inelastic formula of the law what has long before
been condemned by public opinion   but there is this difference 
that while public opinion censures and condemns all the acts
opposed to the moral law  including the most varied cases in its
reprobation  the law which rests on violence only condemns and
punishes a certain very limited range of acts  and by so doing
seems to justify all other acts of the same kind which do not come
under its scope 

public opinion ever since the time of moses has regarded
covetousness  profligacy  and cruelty as wrong  and censured them
accordingly   and it condemns every kind of manifestation of
covetousness  not only the appropriation of the property of others
by force or fraud or trickery  but even the cruel abuse of wealth 
it condemns every form of profligacy  whether with concubine 
slave  divorced woman  or even ones own wife  it condemns every
kind of cruelty  whether shown in blows  in illtreatment  or in
murder  not only of men  but even of animals   the law resting on
force only punishes certain forms of covetousness  such as robbery
and swindling  certain forms of profligacy and cruelty  such as
conjugal infidelity  murder  and wounding   and in this way it
seems to countenance all the manifestations of covetousness 
profligacy  and cruelty which do not come under its narrow
definition 

but besides corrupting public opinion  the use of force leads men to the
fatal conviction that they progress  not through the spiritual impulse
which impels them to the attainment of truth and its realization in
life  and which constitutes the only source of every progressive
movement of humanity  but by means of violence  the very force which 
far from leading men to truth  always carries them further away from it 
this is a fatal error  because it leads men to neglect the chief force
underlying their lifetheir spiritual activityand to turn all their
attention and energy to the use of violence  which is superficial 
sluggish  and most generally pernicious in its action 

they make the same mistake as men who  trying to set a steam
engine in motion  should turn its wheels round with their hands 
not suspecting that the underlying cause of its movement was the
expansion of the steam  and not the motion of the wheels   by
turning the wheels by hand and by levers they could only produce a
semblance of movement  and meantime they would be wrenching the
wheels and so preventing their being fit for real movement 

that is just what people are doing who think to make men advance
by means of external force 

they say that the christian life cannot be established without the
use of violence  because there are savage races outside the pale
of christian societies in africa and in asia there are some who
even represent the chinese as a danger to civilization  and that
in the midst of christian societies there are savage  corrupt 
and  according to the new theory of heredity  congenital
criminals   and violence  they say  is necessary to keep savages
and criminals from annihilating our civilization 

but these savages within and without christian society  who are
such a terror to us  have never been subjugated by violence  and
are not subjugated by it now   nations have never subjugated other
nations by violence alone   if a nation which subjugated another
was on a lower level of civilization  it has never happened that
it succeeded in introducing its organization of life by violence 
on the contrary  it was always forced to adopt the organization of
life existing in the conquered nation   if ever any of the nations
conquered by force have been really subjugated  or even nearly so 
it has always been by the action of public opinion  and never by
violence  which only tends to drive a people to further rebellion 

when whole nations have been subjugated by a new religion  and
have become christian or mohammedan  such a conversion has never
been brought about because the authorities made it obligatory on
the contrary  violence has much oftener acted in the opposite
direction  but because public opinion made such a change
inevitable   nations  on the contrary  who have been driven by
force to accept the faith of their conquerors have always remained
antagonistic to it 

it is just the same with the savage elements existing in the midst
of our civilized societies   neither the increased nor the
diminished severity of punishment  nor the modifications of
prisons  nor the increase of police will increase or diminish the
number of criminals   their number will only be diminished by the
change of the moral standard of society   no severities could put
an end to duels and vendettas in certain districts   in spite of
the number of tcherkesses executed for robbery  they continue to
be robbers from their youth up  for no maiden will marry a
tcherkess youth till he has given proof of his bravery by carrying
off a horse  or at least a sheep   if men cease to fight duels 
and the tcherkesses cease to be robbers  it will not be from fear
of punishment indeed  that invests the crime with additional
charm for youth  but through a change in the moral standard of
public opinion   it is the same with all other crimes   force can
never suppress what is sanctioned by public opinion   on the
contrary  public opinion need only be in direct opposition to
force to neutralize the whole effect of the use of force   it has
always been so and always will be in every case of martyrdom 

what would happen if force were not used against hostile nations
and the criminal elements of society we do not know   but we do
know by prolonged experience that neither enemies nor criminals
have been successfully suppressed by force 

and indeed how could nations be subjugated by violence who are led
by their whole education  their traditions  and even their
religion to see the loftiest virtue in warring with their
oppressors and fighting for freedom   and how are we to suppress
by force acts committed in the midst of our society which are
regarded as crimes by the government and as daring exploits by the
people 

to exterminate such nations and such criminals by violence is
possible  and indeed is done  but to subdue them is impossible 

the sole guide which directs men and nations has always been and
is the unseen  intangible  underlying force  the resultant of all
the spiritual forces of a certain people  or of all humanity 
which finds its outward expression in public opinion 

the use of violence only weakens this force  hinders it and
corrupts it  and tries to replace it by another which far from
being conducive to the progress of humanity  is detrimental to it 

to bring under the sway of christianity all the savage nations
outside the pale of the christian worldall the zulus  mandchoos 
and chinese  whom many regard as savagesand the savages who live
in our midst  there is only one means   that means is the
propagation among these nations of the christian ideal of society 
which can only be realized by a christian life  christian actions 
and christian examples   and meanwhile  though this is the one
only means of gaining a hold over the people who have remained
nonchristian  the men of our day set to work in the directly
opposite fashion to attain this result 

to bring under the sway of christianity savage nations who do not
attack us and whom we have therefore no excuse for oppressing  we
ought before all things to leave them in peace  and in case we
need or wish to enter into closer relations with them  we ought
only to influence them by christian manners and christian
teaching  setting them the example of the christian virtues of
patience  meekness  endurance  purity  brotherhood  and love 
instead of that we begin by establishing among them new markets
for our commerce  with the sole aim of our own profit  then we
appropriate their lands  i  e   rob them  then we sell them
spirits  tobacco  and opium  i  e   corrupt them  then we
establish our morals among them  teach them the use of violence
and new methods of destruction  i  e   we teach them nothing but
the animal law of strife  below which man cannot sink  and we do
all we can to conceal from them all that is christian in us 
after this we send some dozens of missionaries prating to them of
the hypocritical absurdities of the church  and then quote the
failure of our efforts to turn the heathen to christianity as an
incontrovertible proof of the impossibility of applying the truths
of christianity in practical life 

it is just the same with the socalled criminals living in our
midst   to bring these people under the sway of christianity there
is one only means  that is  the christian social ideal  which can
only be realized among them by true christian teaching and
supported by a true example of the christian life   and to preach
this christian truth and to support it by christian example we set
up among them prisons  guillotines  gallows  preparations for
murder  we diffuse among the common herd idolatrous superstitions
to stupefy them  we sell them spirits  tobacco  and opium to
brutalize them  we even organize legalized prostitution  we give
land to those who do not need it  we make a display of senseless
luxury in the midst of suffering poverty  we destroy the
possibility of anything like a christian public opinion  and
studiously try to suppress what christian public opinion is
existing   and then  after having ourselves assiduously corrupted
men  we shut them up like wild beasts in places from which they
cannot escape  and where they become still more brutalized  or
else we kill them   and these very men whom we have corrupted and
brutalized by every means  we bring forward as a proof that one
cannot deal with criminals except by brute force 

we are just like ignorant doctors who put a man  recovering from
illness by the force of nature  into the most unfavorable
conditions of hygiene  and dose him with the most deleterious
drugs  and then assert triumphantly that their hygiene and their
drugs saved his life  when the patient would have been well long
before if they had left him alone 

violence  which is held up as the means of supporting the
christian organization of life  not only fails to produce that
effect  it even hinders the social organization of life from being
what it might and ought to be   the social organization is as good
as it is not as a result of force  but in spite of it 

and therefore the champions of the existing order are mistaken in
arguing that since  even with the aid of force  the bad and
nonchristian elements of humanity can hardly be kept from attacking us 
the abolition of the use of force and the substitution of public opinion
for it would leave humanity quite unprotected 

they are mistaken  because force does not protect humanity  but 
on the contrary  deprives it of the only possible means of really
protecting itself  that is  the establishment and diffusion of a
christian public opinion   only by the suppression of violence
will a christian public opinion cease to be corrupted  and be
enabled to be diffused without hindrance  and men will then turn
their efforts in the spiritual direction by which alone they can
advance 

but how are we to cast off the visible tangible protection of an
armed policeman  and trust to something so intangible as public
opinion   does it yet exist   moreover  the condition of things in
which we are living now  we know  good or bad  we know its
shortcomings and are used to it  we know what to do  and how to
behave under present conditions   but what will happen when we
give it up and trust ourselves to something invisible and
intangible  and altogether unknown 

the unknown world on which they are entering in renouncing their
habitual ways of life appears itself as dreadful to them   it is
all very well to dread the unknown when our habitual position is
sound and secure   but our position is so far from being secure
that we know  beyond all doubt  that we are standing on the brink
of a precipice   if we must be afraid let us be afraid of what is
really alarming  and not what we imagine as alarming 

fearing to make the effort to detach ourselves from our perilous
position because the future is not fully clear to us  we are like
passengers in a foundering ship who  through being afraid to trust
themselves to the boat which would carry them to the shore  shut
themselves up in the cabin and refuse to come out of it  or like
sheep  who  terrified by their barn being on fire  huddle in a
corner and do not go out of the wideopen door 

we are standing on the threshold of the murderous war of social
revolution  terrific in its miseries  beside which  as those who
are preparing it tell us  the horrors of 1793 will be childs
play   and can we talk of the danger threatening us from the
warriors of dahomey  the zulus  and such  who live so far away and
are not dreaming of attacking us  and from some thousands of
swindlers  thieves  and murderers  brutalized and corrupted by
ourselves  whose number is in no way lessened by all our
sentences  prisons  and executions 

moreover this dread of the suppression of the visible protection
of the policeman is essentially a sentiment of townspeople  that
is  of people who are living in abnormal and artificial
conditions   people living in natural conditions of life  not in
towns  but in the midst of nature  and carrying on the struggle
with nature  live without this protection and know how little
force can protect us from the real dangers with which we are
surrounded   there is something sickly in this dread  which is
essentially dependent on the artificial conditions in which many
of us live and have been brought up 

a doctor  a specialist in insanity  told a story that one summer
day when he was leaving the asylum  the lunatics accompanied him
to the street door   come for a walk in the town with me  the
doctor suggested to them   the lunatics agreed  and a small band
followed the doctor   but the further they proceeded along the
street where healthy people were freely moving about  the more
timid they became  and they pressed closer and closer to the
doctor  hindering him from walking   at last they all began to beg
him to take them back to the asylum  to their meaningless but
customary way of life  to their keepers  to blows  strait
waistcoats  and solitary cells 

this is just how men of today huddle in terror and draw back to
their irrational manner of life  their factories  law courts 
prisons  executions  and wars  when christianity calls them to
liberty  to the free  rational life of the future coming age 

people ask  how will our security be guaranteed when the existing
organization is suppressed   what precisely will the new
organization be that is to replace it   so long as we do not know
precisely how our life will be organized  we will not stir a step
forward 

an explorer going to an unknown country might as well ask for a
detailed map of the country before he would start 

if a man  before he passed from one stage to another  could know
his future life in full detail  he would have nothing to live for 
it is the same with the life of humanity  if it had a programme of
the life which awaited it before entering a new stage  it would be
the surest sign that it was not living  nor advancing  but simply
rotating in the same place 

the conditions of the new order of life cannot be known by us
because we have to create them by our own labors   that is all
that life is  to learn the unknown  and to adapt our actions to
this new knowledge 

that is the life of each individual man  and that is the life of
human societies and of humanity 




chapter xi 

the christian conception of life has already arisen in our
society  and will infallibly put an end to the present
organization of our life based on forcewhen that will be 

the condition and organization of our society are terrible  but they
rest only on public opinion  and can be destroyed by italready
violence is regarded from a different point of view  the number of those
who are ready to serve the government is diminishing  and even the
servants of government are ashamed of their position  and so often do
not perform their dutiesthese facts are all signs of the rise of a
public opinion  which continually growing will lead to no one being
willing to enter government servicemoreover  it becomes more and more
evident that those offices are of no practical usemen already begin to
understand the futility of all institutions based on violence  and if a
few already understand it  all will one day understand itthe day of
deliverance is unknown  but it depends on men themselves  on how far
each man lives according to the light that is in him 


the position of christian humanity with its prisons  galleys 
gibbets  its factories and accumulation of capital  its taxes 
churches  ginpalaces  licensed brothels  its everincreasing
armament and its millions of brutalized men  ready  like chained
dogs  to attack anyone against whom their master incites them 
would be terrible indeed if it were the product of violence  but
it is preeminently the product of public opinion   and what has
been established by public opinion can be destroyed by public
opinionand  indeed  is being destroyed by public opinion 

money lavished by hundreds of millions  tens of millions of
disciplined troops  weapons of astounding destructive power  all
organizations carried to the highest point of perfection  a whole
army of men charged with the task of deluding and hypnotizing the
people  and all this  by means of electricity which annihilates
distance  under the direct control of men who regard such an
organization of society not only as necessary for profit  but even
for selfpreservation  and therefore exert every effort of their
ingenuity to preserve itwhat an invincible power it would seem 
and yet we need only imagine for a moment what will really
inevitably come to pass  that is  the christian social standard
replacing the heathen social standard and established with the
same power and universality  and the majority of men as much
ashamed of taking any part in violence or in profiting by it  as
they are today of thieving  swindling  begging  and cowardice 
and at once we see the whole of this complex  and seemingly
powerful organization of society falls into ruins of itself
without a struggle 

and to bring this to pass  nothing new need be brought before
mens minds   only let the mist  which veils from mens eyes the
true meaning of certain acts of violence  pass away  and the
christian public opinion which is springing up would overpower the
extinct public opinion which permitted and justified acts of
violence   people need only come to be as much ashamed to do deeds
of violence  to assist in them or to profit by them  as they now
are of being  or being reputed a swindler  a thief  a coward  or a
beggar   and already this change is beginning to take place   we
do not notice it just as we do not notice the movement of the
earth  because we are moved together with everything around us 

it is true that the organization of society remains in its
principal features just as much an organization based on violence
as it was one thousand years ago  and even in some respects 
especially in the preparation for war and in war itself  it
appears still more brutal   but the rising christian ideal  which
must at a certain stage of development replace the heathen ideal
of life  already makes its influence felt   a dead tree stands
apparently as firmly as everit may even seem firmer because it
is harderbut it is rotten at the core  and soon must fall   it
is just so with the present order of society  based on force   the
external aspect is unchanged   there is the same division of
oppressors and oppressed  but their view of the significance and
dignity of their respective positions is no longer what it once
was 

the oppressors  that is  those who take part in government  and
those who profit by oppression  that is  the rich  no longer
imagine  as they once did  that they are the elect of the world 
and that they constitute the ideal of human happiness and
greatness  to attain which was once the highest aim of the
oppressed 

very often now it is not the oppressed who strive to attain the
position of the oppressors  and try to imitate them  but on the
contrary the oppressors who voluntarily abandon the advantages of
their position  prefer the condition of the oppressed  and try to
resemble them in the simplicity of their life 

not to speak of the duties and occupations now openly despised 
such as that of spy  agent of secret police  moneylender  and
publican  there are a great number of professions formerly
regarded as honorable  such as those of police officials 
courtiers  judges  and administrative functionaries  clergymen 
military officers  speculators  and bankers  which are no longer
considered desirable positions by everyone  and are even despised
by a special circle of the most respected people   there are
already men who voluntarily abandon these professions which were
once reckoned irreproachable  and prefer less lucrative callings
which are in no way connected with the use of force 
and there are even rich men who  not through religious sentiment 
but simply through special sensitiveness to the social standard
that is springing up  relinquish their inherited property 
believing that a man can only justly consume what he has gained by
his own labor 

the position of a government official or of a rich man is no
longer  as it once was  and still is among nonchristian peoples 
regarded as necessarily honorable and deserving of respect  and
under the special blessing of god   the most delicate and moral
people they are generally also the most cultivated avoid such
positions and prefer more humble callings that are not dependent
on the use of force 

the best of our young people  at the age when they are still
uncorrupted by life and are choosing a career  prefer the calling
of doctor  engineer  teacher  artist  writer  or even that of
simple farmer living on his own labor  to legal  administrative 
clerical  and military positions in the pay of government  or to
an idle existence living on their incomes 

monuments and memorials in these days are mostly not erected in
honor of government dignitaries  or generals  or still less of
rich men  but rather of artists  men of science  and inventors 
persons who have nothing in common with the government  and often
have even been in conflict with it   they are the men whose
praises are celebrated in poetry  who are honored by sculpture and
received with triumphant jubilations 

the best men of our day are all striving for such places of honor 
consequently the class from which the wealthy and the government
officials are drawn grows less in number and lower in intelligence
and education  and still more in moral qualities   so that
nowadays the wealthy class and men at the head of government do
not constitute  as they did in former days  the √©lite of society 
on the contrary  they are inferior to the middle class 

in russia and turkey as in america and france  however often the
government change its officials  the majority of them are selfseeking
and corrupt  of so low a moral standard that they do not even come up
the elementary requirements of common honesty expected by the
government  one may often nowadays hear from persons in authority the
na√Øve complaint that the best people are always  by some strangeas it
seems to themfatality  to be found in the camp of the opposition  as
though men were to complain that those who accepted the office of
hangman wereby some strange fatalityall persons of very little
refinement or beauty of character 

the most cultivated and refined people of our society are not
nowadays to be found among the very rich  as used formerly to be
the rule   the rich are mostly coarse money grubbers  absorbed
only  in increasing their hoard  generally by dishonest means  or
else the degenerate heirs of such money grubbers  who  far from
playing any prominent part in society  are mostly treated with
general contempt 

and besides the fact that the class from which the servants of
government and the wealthy are drawn grows less in number and
lower in caliber  they no longer themselves attach the same
importance to their positions as they once did  often they are
ashamed of the ignominy of their calling and do not perform the
duties they are bound to perform in their position   kings and
emperors scarcely govern at all  they scarcely ever decide upon an
internal reform or a new departure in foreign politics   they
mostly leave the decision of such questions to government
institutions or to public opinion   all their duties are reduced
to representing the unity and majesty of government   and even
this duty they perform less and less successfully   the majority
of them do not keep up their old unapproachable majesty  but
become more and more democratized and even vulgarized  casting
aside the external prestige that remained to them  and thereby
destroying the very thing it was their function to maintain 

it is just the same with the army   military officers of the
highest rank  instead of encouraging in their soldiers the
brutality and ferocity necessary for their work  diffuse education
among the soldiers  inculcate humanity  and often even themselves
share the socialistic ideas of the masses and denounce war   in
the last plots against the russian government many of the
conspirators were in the army   and the number of the disaffected
in the army is always increasing   and it often happens there was
a case  indeed  within the last few days that when called upon to
quell disturbances they refuse to fire upon the people   military
exploits are openly reprobated by the military themselves  and are
often the subject of jests among them 

it is the same with judges and public prosecutors  the judges 
whose duty it is to judge and condemn criminals  conduct the
proceedings so as to whitewash them as far as possible   so that
the russian government  to procure the condemnation of those whom
they want to punish  never intrust them to the ordinary tribunals 
but have them tried before a court martial  which is only a
parody of justice   the prosecutors themselves often refuse to
proceed  and even when they do proceed  often in spite of the law 
really defend those they ought to be accusing   the learned
jurists whose business it is to justify the violence of authority 
are more and more disposed to deny the right of punishment and to
replace it by theories of irresponsibility and even of moral
insanity  proposing to deal with those they call criminals by
medical treatment only 

jailers and overseers of galleys generally become the champions of
those whom they ought to torture   police officers and detectives
are continually assisting the escape of those they ought to
arrest   the clergy preach tolerance  and even sometimes condemn
the use of force  and the more educated among them try in their
sermons to avoid the very deception which is the basis of their
position and which it is their duty to support   executioners
refuse to perform their functions  so that in russia the death
penalty cannot be carried out for want of executioners   and in
spite of all the advantages bestowed on these men  who are
selected from convicts  there is a constantly diminishing number
of volunteers for the post   governors  police  officials  tax
collectors often have compassion on the people and try to find
pretexts for not collecting the tax from them   the rich are not
at ease in spending their wealth only on themselves  and lavish
it on works of public utility   landowners build schools and
hospitals on their property  and some even give up the ownership
of their land and transfer it to the cultivators  or establish
communities upon it   millowners and manufacturers build
hospitals  schools  savings banks  asylums  and  dwellings for
their workpeople   some of them form cooperative associations in
which they have shares on the same terms as the others 
capitalists expend a part of their capital on educational 
artistic  philanthropic  and other public institutions   and many 
who are not equal to parting with their wealth in their lifetime 
leave it in their wills to public institutions 

all these phenomena might seem to be mere exceptions  except that
they can all be referred to one common cause   just as one might
fancy the first leaves on the budding trees in april were
exceptional if we did not know that they all have a common cause 
the spring  and that if we see the branches on some trees shooting
and turning green  it is certain that it will soon be so with all 

so it is with the manifestation of the christian standard of
opinion on force and all that is based on force   if this standard
already influences some  the most impressionable  and impels each
in his own sphere to abandon advantages based on the use of force 
then its influence will extend further and further till it
transforms the whole order of mens actions and puts it into
accord with the christian ideal which is already a living force in
the vanguard of humanity 

and if there are now rulers  who do not decide on any step on
their own authority  who try to be as unlike monarchs  and as like
plain mortals as possible  who state their readiness to give up
their prerogatives and become simply the first citizens of a
republic  if there are already soldiers who realize all the sin
and harm of war  and are not willing to fire on men either of
their own or a foreign country  judges and prosecutors who do not
like to try and to condemn criminals  priests  who abjure
deception  taxgatherers who try to perform as little as they can
of their duties  and rich men renouncing their wealththen the
same thing will inevitably happen to other rulers  other soldiers 
other judges  priests  taxgatherers  and rich men   and when
there are no longer men willing to fill these offices  these
offices themselves will disappear too 

but this is not the only way in which public opinion is leading
men to the abolition of the prevailing order and the substitution
of a new order   as the positions based on the rule of force
become less attractive and fewer men are found willing to fill
them  the more will their uselessness be apparent 

everywhere throughout the christian world the same rulers  and the
same governments  the same armies  the same law courts  the same
taxgatherers  the same priests  the same rich men  landowners 
manufacturers  and capitalists  as ever  but the attitude of the
world to them  and their attitude to themselves is altogether
changed 

the same sovereigns have still the same audiences and interviews 
hunts and banquets  and balls and uniforms  there are the same
diplomats and the same deliberations on alliances and wars  there
are still the same parliaments  with the same debates on the
eastern question and africa  on treaties and violations of
treaties  and home rule and the eighthour day  and one set of
ministers replacing another in the same way  and the same speeches
and the same incidents   but for men who observe how one newspaper
article has more effect on the position of affairs than dozens of
royal audiences or parliamentary  sessions  it becomes more and
more evident that these audiences and interviews and debates in
parliaments do not direct the course of affairs  but something
independent of all that  which cannot be concentrated in one
place 

the same generals and officers and soldiers  and cannons and
fortresses  and reviews and maneuvers  but no war breaks out   one
year  ten  twenty years pass by   and it becomes less and less
possible to rely on the army for the pacification of riots  and
more and more evident  consequently  that generals  and officers 
and soldiers are only figures in solemn processionsobjects of
amusement for governmentsa sort of immenseand far too
expensivecorps de ballet 

the same lawyers and judges  and the same assizes  but it becomes
more and more evident that the civil courts decide cases on the
most diverse grounds  but regardless of justice  and that criminal
trials are quite senseless  because the punishments do not attain
the objects aimed at by the judges themselves   these institutions
therefore serve no other purpose than to provide a means of
livelihood for men who are not capable of doing anything more
useful 

the same priests and archbishops and churches and synods  but it
becomes more and more evident that they have long ago ceased to
believe in what they preach  and therefore they can convince no
one of the necessity of believing what they dont believe
themselves 

the same tax collectors  but they are less and less capable of
taking mens property from them by force  and it becomes more and
more evident that people can collect all that is necessary by
voluntary subscription without their aid 

the same rich men  but it becomes more and more evident that they
can only be of use by ceasing to administer their property in
person and giving up to society the whole or at least a part of
their wealth 

and when all this has become absolutely evident to everyone  it
will be natural for men to ask themselves but why should we keep
and maintain all these kings  emperors  presidents  and members of
all sorts of senates and ministries  since nothing comes of all
their debates and audiences   wouldnt it be better  as some
humorist suggested  to make a queen of indiarubber 

and what good to us are these armies with their generals and bands
and horses and drums   and what need is there of them when there
is no war  and no one wants to make war  and if there were a war 
other nations would not let us gain any advantage from it  while
the soldiers refuse to fire on their fellowcountrymen 

and what is the use of these lawyers and judges who dont decide
civil cases with justice and recognize themselves the uselessness
of punishments in criminal cases 

and what is the use of tax collectors who collect the taxes
unwillingly  when it is easy to raise all that is wanted without
them 

what is the use of the clergy  who dont believe in what they
preach 

and what is the use of capital in the hands of private persons 
when it can only be of use as the property of all 

and when once people have asked themselves these questions they
cannot help coming to some decision and ceasing to support all
these institutions which are no longer of use 

but even before those who support these institutions decide to
abolish them  the men who occupy these positions will be reduced
to the necessity of throwing them up 

public opinion more and more condemns the use of force  and
therefore men are less and less willing to fill positions which
rest on the use of force  and if they do occupy them  are less and
less able to make use of force in them  and hence they must become
more and more superfluous 

i once took part in moscow in a religious meeting which used to
take place generally in the week after easter near the church in
the ohotny row   a little knot of some twenty men were collected
together on the pavement  engaged in serious religious discussion 
at the same time there was a kind of concert going on in the
buildings of the court club in the same street  and a police
officer noticing the little group collected near the church sent a
mounted policeman to disperse it   it was absolutely unnecessary
for the officer to disperse it   a group of twenty men was no
obstruction to anyone  but he had been standing there the whole
morning  and he wanted to do something   the policeman  a young
fellow  with a resolute flourish of his right arm and a clink of
his saber  came up to us and commanded us severely move on 
whats this meeting about   everyone looked at the policeman  and
one of the speakers  a quiet man in a peasants dress  answered
with a calm and gracious air  we are speaking of serious matters 
and there is no need for us to move on  you would do better  young
man  to get off your horse and listen   it might do you good 
and turning round he continued his discourse   the policeman
turned his horse and went off without a word 

that is just what should be done in all cases of violence 

the officer was bored  he had nothing to do   he had been put 
poor fellow  in a position in which he had no choice but to give
orders   he was shut off from all human existence  he could do
nothing but superintend and give orders  and give orders and
superintend  though his superintendence and his orders served no
useful purpose whatever   and this is the position in which all
these unlucky rulers  ministers  members of parliament  governors 
generals  officers  archbishops  priests  and even rich men find
themselves to some extent already  and will find themselves
altogether as time goes on   they can do nothing but give orders 
and they give orders and send their messengers  as the officer
sent the policeman  to interfere with people   and because the
people they hinder turn to them and request them not to interfere 
they fancy they are very useful indeed 

but the time will come and is coming when it will be perfectly
evident to everyone that they are not of any use at all  and only
a hindrance  and those whom they interfere with will say gently
and quietly to them  like my friend in the street meeting  pray
dont interfere with us   and all the messengers and those who
send them too will be obliged to follow this good advice  that is
to say  will leave off galloping about  with their arms akimbo 
interfering with people  and getting off their horses and removing
their spurs  will listen to what is being said  and mixing with
others  will take their place with them in some real human work 

the time will come and is inevitably coming when all institutions
based on force will disappear through their uselessness 
stupidity  and even inconvenience becoming obvious to all 

the time must come when the men of our modern world who fill
offices based upon violence will find themselves in the position
of the emperor in andersens tale of the emperors new clothes 
when the child seeing the emperor undressed  cried in all
simplicity  look  he is naked   and then all the rest  who had
seen him and said nothing  could not help recognizing it too 

the story is that there was once an emperor  very fond of new
clothes   and to him came two tailors  who promised to make him
some extraordinary clothes   the emperor engages them and they
begin to sew at them  but they explain that the clothes have the
extraordinary property of remaining invisible to anyone who is
unfit for his position   the courtiers come to look at the
tailors work and see nothing  for the men are plying their
needles in empty space   but remembering the extraordinary
property of the clothes  they all declare they see them and are
loud in their admiration   the emperor does the same himself   the
day of the procession comes in which the emperor is to go out in
his new clothes   the emperor undresses and puts on his new
clothes  that is to say  remains naked  and naked he walks through
the town   but remembering the magic property of the clothes  no
one ventures to say that he has nothing on till a little child
cries out look  he is naked 

this will be exactly the situation of all who continue through
inertia to fill offices which have long become useless directly
someone who has no interest in concealing their uselessness
exclaims in all simplicity but these people have been of no use
to anyone for a long time past 

the condition of christian humanity with its fortresses  cannons 
dynamite  guns  torpedoes  prisons  gallows  churches  factories 
customs offices  and palaces is really terrible   but still
cannons and guns will not fire themselves  prisons will not shut
men up of themselves  gallows will not hang them  churches will
not delude them  nor customs offices hinder them  and palaces and
factories are not built nor kept up of themselves   all those
things are the work of men   if men come to understand that they
ought not to do these things  then they will cease to be   and
already they are beginning to understand it   though all do not
understand it yet  the advanced guard understand and the rest will
follow them   and the advanced guard cannot cease to understand
what they have once understood  and what they understand the rest
not only can but must inevitably understand hereafter 

so that the prophecy that the time will come when men will be
taught of god  will learn war no more  will beat their swords into
plowshares and their spears into reapinghooks  which means 
translating it into our language  the fortresses  prisons 
barracks  palaces  and churches will remain empty  and all the
gibbets and guns and cannons will be left unused  is no longer a
dream  but the definite new form of life to which mankind is
approaching with everincreasing rapidity 

but when will it be 

eighteen  hundred  years ago  to this  question  christ answered
that the end of the world that is  of the pagan organization of
life shall come when the tribulation of men is greater than it
has ever been  and when the gospel of the kingdom of god  that is 
the possibility of a new organization of life   shall be preached
in the world unto all nations  matt  xxiv  328   but of that
day and hour knoweth no man but the father only matt  xxiv  36 
said christ   for it may come any time  in such an hour as
ye think not 

to the question when this hour cometh christ answers that we
cannot know  but just because we cannot know when that hour is
coming we ought to be always ready to meet it  just as the master
ought to watch who guards his house from thieves  as the virgins
ought to watch with lamps alight for the bridegroom  and further 
we ought to work with all the powers given us to bring that hour
to pass  as the servants ought to work with the talents intrusted
to them  matt  xxiv  43  and xxvi  13  1430   and there could
be no answer but this one   men cannot know when the day and the
hour of the kingdom of god will come  because its coming depends
on themselves alone 

the answer is like that of the wise man who  when asked whether it
was far to the town  answered  walk 

how can we tell whether it is far to the goal which humanity is
approaching  when we do not know how men are going toward it 
while it depends on them whether they go or do not go  stand
still  slacken their pace or hasten it   all we can know is what
we who make up mankind ought to do  and not to do  to bring about
the coming of the kingdom of god   and that we all know   and we
need only each begin to do what we ought to do  we need only each
live with all the light that is in us  to bring about at once the
promised kingdom of god to which every mans heart is yearning

1  chance meeting with a train carrying soldiers to restore order
among the famishing peasantsreason of the expeditionhow the
decisions of the higher authorities are enforced in cases of
insubordination on part of the peasantswhat happened at orel  as
an example of how the rights of the propertied classes are
maintained by murder and tortureall the privileges of the
wealthy are based on similar acts of violence 

2  the elements that made up the force sent to toula  and the conduct of
the men composing ithow these men could carry out such actsthe
explanation is not to be found in ignorance  conviction  cruelty 
heartlessness  or want of moral sensethey do these things because they
are necessary to support the existing order  which they consider it
every mans duty to supportthe basis of this conviction that the
existing order is necessary and inevitablein the upper classes this
conviction is based on the advantages of the existing order for
themselvesbut what forces men of the lower classes to believe in the
immutability of the existing order  from which they derive no advantage 
and which they aid in maintaining  facts contrary to their
conscience this is the result of the lower classes being deluded by
the upper  both as to the inevitability of the existing order and the
lawfulness of the acts of violence needed to maintain itdeception in
generalspecial form of deception in regard to military
serviceconscription 

3  how can men allow that murder is permissible while they preach
principles of morality  and how can they allow of the existence in their
midst of a military organization of physical force which is a constant
menace to public security it is only allowed by the upper classes  who
profit by this organization  because their privileges are maintained by
itthe upper classes allow it  and the lower classes carry it into
effect in spite of their consciousness of the immorality of the deeds of
violence  the more readily because through the arrangements of the
government the moral responsibility for such deeds is divided among a
great number of participants in it  and everyone throws the
responsibility on someone elsemoreover  the sense of moral
responsibility is lost through the delusion of inequality  and the
consequent intoxication of power on the part of superiors  and servility
on the part of inferiorsthe condition of these men  acting against the
dictates of their conscience  is like that of hypnotized subjects acting
by suggestionthe difference between this obedience to government
suggestion  and obedience to public opinion  and to the guidance of men
of a higher moral sensethe existing order of society  which is the
result of an extinct public opinion and is inconsistent with the already
existing public opinion of the future  is only maintained by the
stupefaction of the conscience  produced spontaneously by selfinterest
in the upper classes and through hypnotizing in the lower classesthe
conscience or the common sense of such men may awaken  and there are
examples of its sudden awakening  so that one can never be sure of the
deeds of violence they are prepared forit depends entirely on the
point which the sense of the unlawfulness of acts of violence has
reached  and this sense may spontaneously awaken in men  or may be
reawakened by the influence of men of more conscience 

4  everything depends on the strength of the consciousness of
christian truths in each individual manthe leading men of modern
times  however  do not think it necessary to preach or practice
the truths of christianity  but regard the modification of the
external conditions of existence within the limit imposed by
governments as sufficient to reform the life of humanityon this
scientific theory of hypocrisy  which has replaced the hypocrisy
of religion  men of the wealthy classes base their justification
of their positionthrough this hypocrisy they can enjoy the
exclusive privileges of their position by force and fraud  and
still pretend to be christians to one another and be easy in their
mindsthis hypocrisy allows men who preach christianity to take
part in institutions based on violenceno external reformation of
life will render it less miserableits misery the result of
disunion caused by following lies  not the truthunion only
possible in truthhypocrisy hinders this union  since hypocrites
conceal from themselves and others the truth they knowhypocrisy
turns all reforms of life to evilhypocrisy distorts the idea of
good and evil  and so stands in the way of the progress of men
toward perfectionundisguised criminals and malefactors do less
harm than those who live by legalized violence  disguised by
hypocrisyall men feel the iniquity of our life  and would long
ago have transformed it if it had not been dissimulated by
hypocrisybut seem to have reached the extreme limits of
hypocrisy  and we need only make an effort of conscience to awaken
as from a nightmare to a different reality 

5  can man make this effort according to the hypocritical theory
of the day  man is not free to transform his lifeman is not free
in his actions  but he is free to admit or to deny the truth he
knowswhen truth is once admitted  it becomes the basis of
actionmans threefold relation to truththe reason of the
apparent insolubility of the problem of free willmans freedom
consists in the recognition of the truth revealed to him   there
is no other freedomrecognition of truth gives freedom  and shows
the path along which  willingly or unwillingly by mankind  man
must advancethe recognition of truth and real freedom enables
man to share in the work of god  not as the slave  but as the
creator of lifemen need only make the effort to renounce all
thought of bettering the external conditions of life and bend all
their efforts to recognizing and preaching the truth they know  to
put an end to the existing miserable state of things  and to enter
upon the kingdom of god so far as it is yet accessible to manall
that is needed is to make an end of lying and hypocrisybut then
what awaits us in the future what will happen to humanity if men
follow the dictates of their conscience  and how can life go on
with the conditions of civilized life to which we are accustomed 
all uneasiness on these points may be removed by the reflection
that nothing true and good can be destroyed by the realization of
truth  but will only be freed from the alloy of falsehood 

6  our life has reached the extreme limit of misery and cannot be
improved by any systems of organizationall our life and all our
institutions are quite meaninglessare we doing what god wills of us by
preserving our privileges and duties to government we are put in this
position not because the world is so made and it is inevitable  but
because we wish it to be so  because it is to the advantage of some of
usour conscience is in opposition to our position and all our conduct 
and the way out of the contradiction is to be found in the recognition
of the christian truth do not unto others what you would not they
should do unto youas our duties to self must be subordinated to our
duties to others  so must our duties to others be subordinated to our
duties to godthe only way out of our position lies  if not in
renouncing our position and our privileges  at least in recognizing our
sin and not justifying it nor disguising itthe only object of life is
to learn the truth and to act on itacceptance of the position and of
state action deprives life of all objectit is gods will that we
should serve him in our life  that is  that we should bring about the
greatest unity of all that has life  a unity only possible in truth 


i was finishing this book  which i had been working at for two
years  when i happened on the 9th of september to be traveling by
rail through the governments of toula and riazan  where the
peasants were starving last year and where the famine is even more
severe now   at one of the railway stations my train passed an
extra train which was taking a troop of soldiers under the conduct
of the governor of the province  together with muskets 
cartridges  and rods  to flog and murder these same famishing
peasants 

the punishment of flogging by way of carrying the decrees of the
authorities into effect has been more and more frequently adopted
of late in russia  in spite of the fact that corporal punishment
was abolished by law thirty years ago 

i had heard of this  i had even read in the newspapers of the
fearful floggings which had been inflicted in tchernigov  tambov 
saratov  astrakhan  and orel  and of those of which the governor
of nijninovgorod  general baranov  had boasted   but i had never
before happened to see men in the process of carrying out these
punishments 

and here i saw the spectacle of good russians full of the
christian spirit traveling with guns and rods to torture and kill
their starving brethren   the reason for their expedition was as
follows

on one of the estates of a rich landowner the peasants had common
rights on the forest  and having always enjoyed these rights 
regarded the forest as their own  or at least as theirs in common
with the owner   the landowner wished to keep the forest entirely
to himself and began to fell the trees   the peasants lodged a
complaint   the judges in the first instance gave an unjust
decision i say unjust on the authority of the lawyer and
governor  who ought to understand the matter  and decided the
case in favor of the landowner   all the later decisions  even
that of the senate  though they could see that the matter had been
unjustly decided  confirmed the judgment and adjudged the forest
to the landowner   he began to cut down the trees  but the
peasants  unable to believe that such obvious injustice could be
done them by the higher authorities  did not submit to the
decision and drove away the men sent to cut down the trees 
declaring that the forest belonged to them and they would go to
the tzar before they would let them cut it down 

the matter was referred to petersburg  and the order was
transmitted to the governor to carry the decision of the court
into effect   the governor asked for a troop of soldiers   and
here were the soldiers with bayonets and cartridges  and moreover 
a supply of rods  expressly prepared for the purpose and heaped up
in one of the trucks  going to carry the decision of the higher
authorities into effect 

the decisions of the higher authorities are carried into effect by
means of murder or torture  or threats of one or the other 
according to whether they offer resistance or not 

in the first case if the peasants offer resistance the practice is
in russia  and it is the same everywhere where a state
organization and private property exist  as follows   the governor
delivers an address in which he demands submission   the excited
crowd  generally deluded by their leaders  dont understand a word
of what the representative of authority is saying in the pompous
official language  and their excitement continues   then the
governor announces that if they do not submit and disperse  he
will be obliged to have recourse to force   if the crowd does not
disperse even on this  the governor gives the order to fire over
the heads of the crowd   if the crowd does not even then disperse 
the governor gives the order to fire straight into the crowd  the
soldiers fire and the killed and wounded fall about the street 
then the crowd usually runs away in all directions  and the troops
at the governors command take those who are supposed to be the
ringleaders and lead them off under escort   then they pick up the
dying  the wounded  and the dead  covered with blood  sometimes
women and children among them   the dead they bury and the wounded
they carry to the hospital   those whom they regard as the
ringleaders they take to the town hall and have them tried by a
special courtmartial   and if they have had recourse to violence
on their side  they are condemned to be hanged   and then the
gallows is erected   and they solemnly strangle a few defenseless
creatures 

this is what has often been done in russia  and is and must always
be done where the social order is based on force 

but in the second case  when the peasants do submit  something
quite special  peculiar to russia  takes place   the governor
arrives on the scene of action and delivers an harangue to the
people  reproaching them for their insubordination  and either
stations troops in the houses of the villages  where sometimes for
a whole month the soldiers drain the resources of the peasants  or
contenting himself with threats  he mercifully takes leave of the
people  or what is the most frequent course  he announces that the
ringleaders must be punished  and quite arbitrarily without any
trial selects a certain number of men  regarded as ringleaders 
and commands them to be flogged in his presence 

in order to give an idea of how such things are done i will
describe a proceeding of the kind which took place in orel  and
received the full approval of the highest authorities 

this is what took place in orel   just as here in the toula
province  a landlord wanted to appropriate the property of the
peasants and just in the same way the peasants opposed it   the
matter in dispute was a fall of water  which irrigated the
peasants fields  and which the landowner wanted to cut off and
divert to turn his mill   the peasants rebelled against this being
done   the land owner laid a complaint before the district
commander  who illegally as was recognized later even by a legal
decision decided the matter in favor of the landowner  and
allowed him to divert the water course   the landowner sent
workmen to dig the conduit by which the water was to be let off to
turn the mill   the peasants were indignant at this unjust
decision  and sent their women to prevent the landowners men from
digging this conduit   the women went to the dykes  overturned the
carts  and drove away the men   the landowner made a complaint
against the women for thus taking the law into their own  hands 
the district commander  made out an order that from  every house
throughout the village one woman was to be taken and put in prison 
the order was not easily executed   for in every household there
were several women  and it was impossible to know which one was to
be arrested   consequently the police did not carry out the order 
the landowner complained to the governor of the neglect on the
part of the police  and the latter  without examining into the
affair  gave the chief official of the police strict orders to
carry out the instructions of the district commander without
delay   the police official  in obedience to his superior  went to
the village and with the insolence peculiar to russian officials
ordered his policemen to take one woman out of each house   but
since there were more than one woman in each house  and there was
no knowing which one was sentenced to imprisonment  disputes and
opposition arose   in spite of these disputes and opposition 
however  the officer of police gave orders that some woman 
whichever came first  should be taken from each household and led
away to prison   the peasants began to defend their wives and
mothers  would not let them go  and beat the police and their
officer   this was a fresh and terrible crime resistance was
offered to the authorities   a report of this new offense was sent
to the town   and so this governorprecisely as the governor of
toula was doing on that daywith a battalion of soldiers with
guns and rods  hastily brought together by means of telegraphs and
telephones and railways  proceeded by a special train to the scene
of action  with a learned doctor whose duty it was to insure the
flogging being of an hygienic character   herzens prophecy of the
modern ghenghis khan with his telegrams is completely realized by
this governor 

before the town hall of the district were the soldiery  a
battalion of police with their revolvers slung round them with red
cords  the persons of most importance among the peasants  and the
culprits   a crowd of one thousand or more people were standing
round   the governor  on arriving  stepped out of his carriage 
delivered a prepared harangue  and asked for the culprits and a
bench   the latter demand was at first not understood   but a
police constable whom the governor always took about with him  and
who undertook to organize such executionsby no means exceptional
in that provinceexplained that what was meant was a bench for
flogging   a bench was brought as well as the rods  and then the
executioners were summoned the latter had been selected
beforehand from some horsestealers of the same village  as the
soldiers refused the office   when everything was ready  the
governor ordered the first of the twelve culprits pointed out by
the landowner as the most guilty to come forward   the first to
come forward was the head of a family  a man of forty who had
always stood up manfully for the rights of his class  and
therefore was held in the greatest esteem by all the villagers 
he was led to the bench and stripped  and then ordered to lie
down 

the peasant attempted to supplicate for mercy  but seeing it was
useless  he crossed himself and lay down   two police constables
hastened to hold him down   the learned doctor stood by  in
readiness to give his aid and his medical science when they should
be needed   the convicts spit into their hands  brandished the
rods  and began to flog   it seemed  however  that the bench was
too narrow  and it was difficult to keep the victim writhing in
torture upon it   then the governor ordered them to bring another
bench and to put a plank across them   soldiers  with their hands
raised to their caps  and respectful murmurs of yes  your
excellency  hasten obediently to carry out this order   meanwhile
the tortured man  half naked  pale and scowling  stood waiting 
his eyes fixed on the ground and his teeth chattering   when
another bench had been brought they again made him lie down  and
the convicted thieves again began to flog him 

the victims back and thighs and legs  and even his sides  became
more and more covered with scars and wheals  and at every blow
there came the sound of the deep groans which he could no longer
restrain   in the crowd standing round were heard the sobs of
wives  mothers  children  the families of the tortured man and of
all the others picked out for punishment 

the miserable governor  intoxicated with power  was counting the
strokes on his fingers  and never left off smoking cigarettes 
while several officious persons hastened on every opportunity to
offer him a burning match to light them   when more than fifty
strokes had been given  the peasant ceased to shriek and writhe 
and the doctor  who had been educated in a government institution
to serve his sovereign and his country with his scientific
attainments  went up to the victim  felt his pulse  listened to
his heart  and announced to the representative of authority that
the man undergoing punishment had lost consciousness  and that  in
accordance with the conclusions of science  to continue the
punishment would endanger the victims life   but the miserable
governor  now completely intoxicated by the sight of blood  gave
orders that the punishment should go on  and the flogging was
continued up to seventy strokes  the number which the governor had
for some reason fixed upon as necessary   when the seventieth
stroke had been reached  the governor said enough   next one 
and the mutilated victim  his back covered with blood  was lifted
up and carried away unconscious  and another was led up   the sobs
and groans of the crowd grew louder   but the representative of
the state continued the torture 

thus they flogged each of them up to the twelfth  and each of them
received seventy strokes   they all implored mercy  shrieked and
groaned   the sobs and cries of the crowd of women grew louder and
more heartrending  and the mens faces grew darker and darker 
but they were surrounded by troops  and the torture did not cease
till it had reached the limit which had been fixed by the caprice
of the miserable halfdrunken and insane creature they called the
governor 

the officials  and officers  and soldiers not only assisted in it 
but were even partly responsible for the affair  since by their
presence they prevented any interference on the part of the crowd 

when i inquired of one of the governors why they made use of this
kind of torture when people had already submitted and soldiers
were stationed in the village  he replied with the important air
of a man who thoroughly understands all the subtleties of
statecraft  that if the peasants were not thoroughly subdued by
flogging  they would begin offering opposition to the decisions of
authorities again   when some of them had been thoroughly
tortured  the authority of the state would be secured forever
among them 

and so that was why the governor of toula was going in his turn
with his subordinate officials  officers  and soldiers to carry
out a similar measure   by precisely the same means  i  e   by
murder and torture  obedience to the decision of the higher
authorities was to be secured   and this decision was to enable a
young landowner  who had an income of one hundred thousand  to
gain three thousand rubles more by stealing a forest from a whole
community of cold and famished peasants  to spend it  in two or
three weeks in the saloons of moscow  petersburg  or paris   that
was what those people whom i met were going to do 

after my thoughts had for two years been turned in the same
direction  fate seemed expressly to have brought me face to face
for the first time in my life with a fact which showed me
absolutely unmistakably in practice what had long been clear to me
in theory  that the organization of our society rests  not as
people interested in maintaining the present order of things like
to imagine  on certain principles of jurisprudence  but on simple
brute force  on the murder and torture of men 

people who own great estates or fortunes  or who receive great
revenues drawn from the class who are in want even of necessities 
the working class  as well as all those who like merchants 
doctors  artists  clerks  learned professors  coachmen  cooks 
writers  valets  and barristers  make their living about these
rich people  like to believe that the privileges they enjoy are
not the result of force  but of absolutely free and just
interchange of services  and that their advantages  far from being
gained by such punishments and murders as took place in orel and
several parts of russia this year  and are always taking place all
over europe and america  have no kind of connection with these
acts of violence   they like to believe that their privileges
exist apart and are the result of free contract among people  and
that the violent cruelties perpetrated on the people also exist
apart and are the result of some general judicial  political  or
economical laws   they try not to see that they all enjoy their
privileges as a result of the same fact which forces the peasants
who have tended the forest  and who are in the direct need of it
for fuel  to give it up to a rich landowner who has taken no part
in caring for its growth and has no need of it whateverthe fact 
that is  that if they dont give it up they will be flogged or
killed 

and yet if it is clear that it was only by means of menaces  blows  or
murder  that the mill in orel was enabled to yield a larger income  or
that the forest which the peasants had planted became the property of a
landowner  it should be equally clear that all the other exclusive
rights enjoyed by the rich  by robbing the poor of their necessities 
rest on the same basis of violence  if the peasants  who need land to
maintain their families  may not cultivate the land about their houses 
but one man  a russian  english  austrian  or any other great landowner 
possesses land enough to maintain a thousand families  though he does
not cultivate it himself  and if a merchant profiting by the misery of
the cultivators  taking corn from them at a third of its value  can keep
this corn in his granaries with perfect security while men are starving
all around him  and sell it again for three times its value to the very
cultivators he bought it from  it is evident that all this too comes
from the same cause  and if one man may not buy of another a commodity
from the other side of a certain fixed line  called the frontier 
without paying certain duties on it to men who have taken no part
whatever in its productionand if men are driven to sell their last cow
to pay taxes which the government distributes among its functionaries 
and spends on maintaining soldiers to murder these very taxpayersit
would appear selfevident that all this does not come about as the
result of any abstract laws  but is based on just what was done in orel 
and which may be done in toula  and is done periodically in one form or
another throughout the whole world wherever there is a government  and
where there are rich and poor 

simply because torture and murder are not employed in every
instance of oppression by force  those who enjoy the exclusive
privileges of the ruling classes persuade themselves and others
that their privileges are not based on torture and murder  but on
some mysterious general causes  abstract laws  and so on   yet one
would think it was perfectly clear that if men  who consider it
unjust and all the working classes do consider it so nowadays 
still pay the principal part of the produce of their labor away to
the capitalist and the landowner  and pay taxes  though they know
to what a bad use these taxes are put  they do so not from
recognition of abstract laws of which they have never heard  but
only because they know they will be beaten and killed if they
dont do so 

and if there is no need to imprison  beat  and kill men every time
the landlord collects his rents  every time those who are in want
of bread have to pay a swindling merchant three times its value 
every time the factory hand has to be content with a wage less
than half of the profit made by the employer  and every time a
poor man pays his last ruble in taxes  it is because so many men
have been beaten and killed for trying to resist these demands 
that the lesson has now been learnt very thoroughly 

just as a trained tiger  who does not eat meat put under his nose 
and jumps over a stick at the word of command  does not act thus
because he likes it  but because he remembers the redhot irons or
the fast with which he was punished every time he did not obey  so
men submitting to what is disadvantageous or even ruinous to them 
and considered by them as unjust  act thus because they remember
what they suffered for resisting it 

as for those who profit by the privileges gained by previous acts
of violence  they often forget and like to forget how these
privileges were obtained   but one need only recall the facts of
history  not the history of the exploits of different dynasties of
rulers  but real history  the history of the oppression of the
majority by a small number of men  to see that all the advantages
the rich have over the poor are based on nothing but flogging 
imprisonment  and murder 

one need but reflect on the unceasing  persistent struggle of all
to better their material position  which is the guiding motive of
men of the present day  to be convinced that the advantages of the
rich over the poor could never and can never be maintained by
anything but force 

there may be cases of oppression  of violence  and of punishments 
though they are rare  the aim of which is not to secure the
privileges of the propertied classes   but one may confidently
assert that in any society where  for every man living in ease 
there are ten exhausted by labor  envious  covetous  and often
suffering with their families from direct privation  all the
privileges of the rich  all their luxuries and superfluities  are
obtained and maintained only by tortures  imprisonment  and
murder 

the train i met on the 9th of september going with soldiers  guns 
cartridges  and rods  to confirm the rich landowner in the
possession of a small forest which he had taken from the starving
peasants  which they were in the direst need of  and he was in no
need of at all  was a striking proof of how men are capable of
doing deeds directly opposed to their principles and their
conscience without perceiving it 

the special train consisted of one firstclass carriage for the
governor  the officials  and officers  and several luggage vans
crammed full of soldiers   the latter  smart young fellows in
their clean new uniforms  were standing about in groups or sitting
swinging their legs in the wide open doorways of the luggage vans 
some were smoking  nudging each other  joking  grinning  and
laughing  others were munching sunflower seeds and spitting out
the husks with an air of dignity   some of them ran along the
platform to drink some water from a tub there  and when they met
the officers they slackened their pace  made their stupid gesture
of salutation  raising their hands to their heads with serious
faces as though they were doing something of the greatest
importance   they kept their eyes on them till they had passed by
them  and then set off running still more merrily  stamping their
heels on the platform  laughing and chattering after the manner of
healthy  goodnatured young fellows  traveling in lively company 

they were going to assist at the murder of their fathers or
grandfathers just as if they were going on a party of pleasure  or
at any rate on some quite ordinary business 

the same impression was produced by the welldressed functionaries
and officers who were scattered about the platform and in the
firstclass carriage   at a table covered with bottles was sitting
the governor  who was responsible for the whole expedition 
dressed in his halfmilitary uniform and eating something while he
chatted tranquilly about the weather with some acquaintances he
had met  as though the business he was upon was of so simple and
ordinary a character that it could not disturb his serenity and
his interest in the change of weather 

at a little distance from the table sat the general of the police 
he was not taking any refreshment  and had an impenetrable bored
expression  as though he were weary of the formalities to be gone
through   on all sides officers were bustling noisily about in
their red uniforms trimmed with gold  one sat at a table finishing
his bottle of beer  another stood at the buffet eating a cake  and
brushing the crumbs off his uniform  threw down his money with a
selfconfident air  another was sauntering before the carriages of
our train  staring at the faces of the women 

all these men who were going to murder or to torture the famishing
and defenseless creatures who provide them their sustenance had
the air of men who knew very well that they were doing their duty 
and some were even proud  were glorying in what they were doing 

what is the meaning of it 

all these people are within half an hour of reaching the place
where  in order to provide a wealthy young man with three thousand
rubles stolen from a whole community of famishing peasants  they
may be forced to commit the most horrible acts one can conceive 
to murder or torture  as was done in orel  innocent beings  their
brothers  and they see the place and time approaching with
untroubled serenity 

to say that all these government officials  officers  and soldiers
do not know what is before them is impossible  for they are
prepared for it   the governor must have given directions about
the rods  the officials must have sent an order for them 
purchased them  and entered the item in their accounts   the
military officers have given and received orders about cartridges 
they all know that they are going to torture  perhaps to kill 
their famishing fellowcreatures  and that they must set to work
within an hour 

to say  as is usually said  and as they would themselves repeat 
that they are acting from conviction of the necessity for
supporting the state organization  would be a mistake   for in the
first place  these men have probably never even thought about
state organization and the necessity of it  in the second place 
they cannot possibly be convinced that the act in which they are
taking part will tend to support rather than to ruin the state 
and thirdly  in reality the majority  if not all  of these men 
far from ever sacrificing their own pleasure or tranquillity to
support the state  never let slip an opportunity of profiting at
the expense of the state in every way they can increase their own
pleasure and ease   so that they are not acting thus for the sake
of the abstract principle of the state 

what is the meaning of it 

yet i know all these men   if i dont know all of them personally 
i know their characters pretty nearly  their past  and their way
of thinking   they certainly all have mothers  some of them wives
and children   they are certainly for the most part good  kind 
even tenderhearted fellows  who hate every sort of cruelty  not
to speak of murder  many of them would not kill or hurt an animal 
moreover  they are all professed christians and regard all
violence directed against the defenseless as base and disgraceful 

certainly not one of them would be capable in everyday life  for
his own personal profit  of doing a hundredth part of what the
governor of orel did   every one of them would be insulted at the
supposition that he was capable of doing anything of the kind in
private life 

and yet they are within half an hour of reaching the place where
they may be reduced to the inevitable necessity of committing this
crime 

what is the meaning of it 

but it is not only these men who are going by train prepared for
murder and torture   how could the men who began the whole
business  the landowner  the commissioner  the judges  and those
who gave the order and are responsible for it  the ministers  the
tzar  who are also good men  professed christians  how could they
elaborate such a plan and assent to it  knowing its consequences 
the spectators even  who took no part in the affair  how could
they  who are indignant at the sight of any cruelty in private
life  even the overtaxing of a horse  allow such a horrible deed
to be perpetrated   how was it they did not rise in indignation
and bar the roads  shouting  no  flog and kill starving men
because they wont let their last possession be stolen from them
without resistance  that we wont allow   but far from anyone
doing this  the majority  even of those who were the cause of the
affair  such as the commissioner  the landowner  the judge  and
those who took part in it and arranged it  as the governor  the
ministers  and the tzar  are perfectly tranquil and do not even
feel a prick of conscience   and apparently all the men who are
going to carry out this crime are equally undisturbed 

the spectators  who one would suppose could have no personal
interest in the affair  looked rather with sympathy than with
disapproval at all these people preparing to carry out this
infamous action   in the same compartment with me was a wood
merchant  who had risen from a peasant   he openly expressed aloud
his sympathy with such punishments   they cant disobey the
authorities  he said  thats what the authorities are for   let
them have a lesson  send their fleas flying   theyll give over
making commotions  i warrant you   thats what they want 

what is the meaning of it 

it is not possible to say that all these people who have provoked
or aided or allowed this deed are such worthless creatures that 
knowing all the infamy of what they are doing  they do it against
their principles  some for pay and for profit  others through fear
of punishment   all of them in certain circumstances know how to
stand up for their principles   not one of these officials would
steal a purse  read another mans letter  or put up with an
affront without demanding satisfaction   not one of these officers
would consent to cheat at cards  would refuse to pay a debt of
honor  would betray a comrade  run away on the field of battle  or
desert the flag   not one of these soldiers would spit out the
holy sacrament or eat meat on good friday   all these men are
ready to face any kind of privation  suffering  or danger rather
than consent to do what they regard as wrong   they have therefore
the strength to resist doing what is against their principles 

it is even less possible to assert that all these men are such
brutes that it is natural and not distasteful to them to do such
deeds   one need only talk to these people a little to see that
all of them  the landowner even  and the judge  and the minister
and the tzar and the government  the officers and the soldiers 
not only disapprove of such things in the depth of their soul  but
suffer from the consciousness of their participation in them when
they recollect what they imply   but they try not to think about
it 

one need only talk to any of these who are taking part in the
affair from the landowner to the lowest policeman or soldier to
see that in the depth of their soul they all know it is a wicked
thing  that it would be better to have nothing to do with it  and
are suffering from the knowledge 

a lady of liberal views  who was traveling in the same train with
us  seeing the governor and the officers in the firstclass saloon
and learning the object of the expedition  began  intentionally
raising her voice so that they should hear  to abuse the existing
order of things and to cry shame on men who would take part in
such proceedings   everyone felt awkward  none knew where to look 
but no one contradicted her   they tried to look as though such
remarks were not worth answering   but one could see by their
faces and their averted eyes that they were ashamed   i noticed
the same thing in the soldiers   they too knew that what they were
sent to do was a shameful thing  but they did not want to think
about what was before them 

when the wood merchant  as i suspect insincerely only to show that
he was a man of education  began to speak of the necessity of such
measures  the soldiers who heard him all turned away from him 
scowling and pretending not to hear 

all the men who  like the landowner  the commissioner  the
minister  and the tzar  were responsible for the perpetration of
this act  as well as those who were now going to execute it  and
even those who were mere spectators of it  knew that it was a
wickedness  and were ashamed of taking any share in it  and even
of being present at it 

then why did they do it  or allow it to be done 

ask them the question   and the landowner who started the affair 
and the judge who pronounced a clearly unjust even though formally
legal decision  and those who commanded the execution of the
decision  and those who  like the policemen  soldiers  and
peasants  will execute the deed with their own hands  flogging and
killing their brothers  all who have devised  abetted  decreed 
executed  or allowed such crimes  will make substantially the same
reply 

the authorities  those who have started  devised  and decreed the
matter  will say that such acts are necessary for the maintenance
of the existing order  the maintenance of the existing order is
necessary for the welfare of the country and of humanity  for the
possibility of social existence and human progress 

men of the poorer class  peasants and soldiers  who will have to
execute the deed of violence with their own hands  say that they
do so because it is the command of their superior authority  and
the superior authority knows what he is about   that those are in
authority who ought to be in authority  and that they know what
they are doing appears to them a truth of which there can be no
doubt   if they could admit the possibility of mistake or error 
it would only be in functionaries of a lower grade  the highest
authority on which all the rest depends seems to them immaculate
beyond suspicion 

though expressing the motives of their conduct differently  both
those in command and their subordinates are agreed in saying that
they act thus because the existing order is the order which must
and ought to exist at the present time  and that therefore to
support it is the sacred duty of every man 

on this acceptance of the necessity and therefore immutability of
the existing order  all who take part in acts of violence on the
part of government base the argument always advanced in their
justification   since the existing order is immutable  they say 
the refusal of a single individual to perform the duties laid
upon him will effect no change in things  and will only mean that
some other man will be put in his place who may do the work worse 
that is to say  more cruelly  to the still greater injury of the
victims of the act of violence 

this conviction that the existing order is the necessary and
therefore immutable order  which it is a sacred duty for every man
to support  enables good men  of high principles in private life 
to take part with conscience more or less untroubled in crimes
such as that perpetrated in orel  and that which the men in the
toula train were going to perpetrate 

but what is this conviction based on   it is easy to understand
that the landowner prefers to believe that the existing order is
inevitable and immutable  because this existing order secures him
an income from his hundreds and thousands of acres  by means of
which he can lead his habitual indolent and luxurious life 

it is easy to understand that the judge readily believes in the
necessity of an order of things through which he receives a wage
fifty times as great as the most industrious laborer can earn  and
the same applies to all the higher officials   it is only under
the existing r√©gime that as governor  prosecutor  senator  members
of the various councils  they can receive their several thousands
of rubles a year  without which they and their families would at
once sink into ruin  since if it were not for the position they
occupy they would never by their own abilities  industry  or
acquirements get a thousandth part of their salaries   the
minister  the tzar  and all the higher authorities are in the same
position   the only distinction is that the higher and the more
exceptional their position  the more necessary it is for them to
believe that the existing order is the only possible order of
things   for without it they would not only be unable to gain an
equal position  but would be found to fall lower than all other
people   a man who has of his own free will entered the police
force at a wage of ten rubles  which he could easily earn in any
other position  is hardly dependent on the preservation of the
existing r√©gime  and so he may not believe in its immutability 
but a king or an emperor  who receives millions for his post  and
knows that there are thousands of people round him who would like
to dethrone him and take his place  who knows that he will never
receive such a revenue or so much honor in any other position  who
knows  in most cases through his more or less despotic rule  that
if he were dethroned he would have to answer for all his abuse of
powerhe cannot but believe in the necessity and even sacredness
of the existing order   the higher and the more profitable a mans
position  the more unstable it becomes  and the more terrible and
dangerous a fall from it for him  the more firmly the man believes
in the existing order  and therefore with the more ease of
conscience can such a man perpetrate cruel and wicked acts  as
though they were not in his own interest  but for the maintenance
of that order 

this is the case with all men in authority  who occupy positions
more profitable than they could occupy except for the present
r√©gime  from the lowest police officer to the tzar   all of them
are more or less convinced that the existing order is immutable 
becausethe chief considerationit is to their advantage   but
the peasants  the soldiers  who are at the bottom of the social
scale  who have no kind of advantage from the existing order  who
are in the very lowest position of subjection and humiliation 
what forces them to believe that the existing order in which they
are in their humble and disadvantageous position is the order
which ought to exist  and which they ought to support even at the
cost of evil actions contrary to their conscience 

what forces these men to the false reasoning that the existing
order is unchanging  and that therefore they ought to support it 
when it is so obvious  on the contrary  that it is only unchanging
because they themselves support it 

what forces these peasants  taken only yesterday from the plow and
dressed in ugly and unseemly costumes with blue collars and gilt
buttons  to go with guns and sabers and murder their famishing
fathers and brothers   they gain no kind of advantage and can be
in no fear of losing the position they occupy  because it is worse
than that from which they have been taken 

the persons in authority of the higher orderslandowners 
merchants  judges  senators  governors  ministers  tzars  and
officerstake part in such doings because the existing order is
to their advantage   in other respects they are often good and
kindhearted men  and they are more able to take part in such
doings because their share in them is limited to suggestions 
decisions  and orders   these persons in authority never do
themselves what they suggest  decide  or command to be done   for
the most part they do not even see how all the atrocious deeds
they have suggested and authorized are carried out   but the
unfortunate men of the lower orders  who gain no kind of advantage
from the existing r√©gime  but  on the contrary  are treated with
the utmost contempt  support it even by dragging people with their
own hands from their families  handcuffing them  throwing them in
prison  guarding them  shooting them 

why do they do it   what forces them to believe that the existing
order is unchanging and they must support it 

all violence rests  we know  on those who do the beating  the
handcuffing  the imprisoning  and the killing with their own hands  if
there were no soldiers or armed policemen  ready to kill or outrage
anyone as they are ordered  not one of those people who sign sentences
of death  imprisonment  or galleyslavery for life would make up his
mind to hang  imprison  or torture a thousandth part of those whom 
quietly sitting in his study  he now orders to be tortured in all kinds
of ways  simply because he does not see it nor do it himself  but only
gets it done at a distance by these servile tools 

all the acts of injustice and cruelty which are committed in the
ordinary course of daily life have only become habitual because
there are these men always ready to carry out such acts of
injustice and cruelty   if it were not for them  far from anyone
using violence against the immense masses who are now illtreated 
those who now command their punishment would not venture to
sentence them  would not even dare to dream of the sentences they
decree with such easy confidence at present   and if it were not
for these men  ready to kill or torture anyone at their
commanders will  no one would dare to claim  as all the idle
landowners claim with such assurance  that a piece of land 
surrounded by peasants  who are in wretchedness from want of land 
is the property of a man who does not cultivate it  or that stores
of corn taken by swindling from the peasants ought to remain
untouched in the midst of a population dying of hunger because the
merchants must make their profit   if it were not for these
servile instruments at the disposal of the authorities  it could
never have entered the head of the landowner to rob the peasants
of the forest they had tended  nor of the officials to think they
are entitled to their salaries  taken from the famishing people 
the price of their oppression  least of all could anyone dream of
killing or exiling men for exposing falsehood and telling the
truth   all this can only be done because the authorities are
confidently assured that they have always these servile tools at
hand  ready to carry all their demands into effect by means of
torture and murder 

all the deeds of violence of tyrants from napoleon to the lowest
commander of a company who fires upon a crowd  can only be
explained by the intoxicating effect of their absolute power over
these slaves   all force  therefore  rests on these men  who carry
out the deeds of violence with their own hands  the men who serve
in the police or the army  especially the army  for the police
only venture to do their work because the army is at their back 

what  then  has brought these masses of honest men  on whom the
whole thing depends  who gain nothing by it  and who have to do
these atrocious deeds with their own hands  what has brought them
to accept the amazing delusion that the existing order 
unprofitable  ruinous  and fatal as it is for them  is the order
which ought to exist 

who has led them into this amazing delusion 

they can never have persuaded themselves that they ought to do what is
against their conscience  and also the source of misery and ruin for
themselves  and all their class  who make up ninetenths of the
population 

how can you kill people  when it is written in gods commandment
thou shalt not kill   i have often inquired of different
soldiers   and i always drove them to embarrassment and confusion
by reminding them of what they did not want to think about   they
knew they were bound by the law of god  thou shalt not kill  and
knew too that they were bound by their duty as soldiers  but had
never reflected on the contradiction between these duties   the
drift of the timid answers i received to this question was always
approximately this that killing in war and executing criminals by
command of the government are not included in the general
prohibition of murder   but when i said this distinction was not
made in the law of god  and reminded them of the christian duty of
fraternity  forgiveness of injuries  and love  which could not be
reconciled with murder  the peasants usually agreed  but in their
turn began to ask me questions   how does it happen  they
inquired  that the government which according to their ideas
cannot do wrong sends the army to war and orders criminals to be
executed   when i answered that the government does wrong in
giving such orders  the peasants fell into still greater
confusion  and either broke off the conversation or else got angry
with me 

they must have found a law for it   the archbishops know as much
about it as we do  i should hope  a russian soldier once observed
to me   and in saying this the soldier obviously set his mind at
rest  in the full conviction that his spiritual guides had found a
law which authorized his ancestors  and the tzars and their
descendants  and millions of men  to serve as he was doing
himself  and that the question i had put him was a kind of hoax or
conundrum on my part 

everyone in our christian society knows  either by tradition or by
revelation or by the voice of conscience  that murder is one of
the most fearful crimes a man can commit  as the gospel tells us 
and that the sin of murder cannot be limited to certain persons 
that is  murder cannot be a sin for some and not a sin for others 
everyone knows that if murder is a sin  it is always a sin 
whoever are the victims murdered  just like the sin of adultery 
theft  or any other   at the same time from their childhood up men
see that murder is not only permitted  but even sanctioned by the
blessing of those whom they are accustomed to regard as their
divinely appointed spiritual guides  and see their secular leaders
with calm assurance organizing murder  proud to wear murderous
arms  and demanding of others in the name of the laws of the
country  and even of god  that they should take part in murder 
men see that there is some inconsistency here  but not being able
to analyze it  involuntarily assume that this apparent
inconsistency is only the result of their ignorance   the very
grossness and obviousness of the inconsistency confirms them in
this conviction 

they cannot imagine that the leaders of civilization  the
educated classes  could so confidently preach two such opposed
principles as the law of christ and murder   a simple uncorrupted
youth cannot imagine that those who stand so high in his opinion 
whom he regards as holy or learned men  could for any object
whatever mislead him so shamefully   but this is just what has
always been and always is done to him   it is done 1 by
instilling  by example and direct instruction  from childhood up 
into the working people  who have not time to study moral and
religious questions for themselves  the idea that torture and
murder are compatible with christianity  and that for certain
objects of state  torture and murder are not only admissible  but
ought to be employed  and 2 by instilling into certain of the
people  who have either voluntarily enlisted or been taken by
compulsion into the army  the idea that the perpetration of murder
and torture with their own hands is a sacred duty  and even a
glorious exploit  worthy of praise and reward 

the general delusion is diffused among all people by means of the
catechisms or books  which nowadays replace them  in use for the
compulsory education of children   in them it is stated that
violence  that is  imprisonment and execution  as well as murder
in civil or foreign war in the defense and maintenance of the
existing state organization whatever that may be  absolute or
limited monarchy  convention  consulate  empire of this or that
napoleon or boulanger  constitutional monarchy  commune or
republic is absolutely lawful and not opposed to morality and
christianity 

this is stated in all catechisms or books used in schools   and
men are so thoroughly persuaded of it that they grow up  live and
die in that conviction without once entertaining a doubt about it 

this is one form of deception  the general deception instilled
into everyone  but there is another special deception practiced
upon the soldiers or police who are picked out by one means or
another to do the torturing and murdering necessary to defend and
maintain the existing r√©gime 

in all military instructions there appears in one form or another
what is expressed in the russian military code in the following
words

article 87   to carry out exactly and without comment the orders
of a superior officer means to carry out an order received from a
superior officer exactly without considering whether it is good or
not  and whether it is possible to carry it out   the superior
officer is responsible for the consequences of the order he gives 

article 88   the subordinate ought never to refuse to carry out
the orders of a superior officer except when he sees clearly that
in carrying out his superior officers command  he breaks the law
of god  one involuntarily expects  not at all his oath of
fidelity and allegiance to the tzar 

it is here said that the man who is a soldier can and ought to
carry out all the orders of his superior without exception   and
as these orders for the most part involve murder  it follows that
he ought to break all the laws of god and man   the one law he may
not break is that of fidelity and allegiance to the man who
happens at a given moment to be in power 

precisely the same thing is said in other words in all codes of
military instruction   and it could not be otherwise  since the
whole power of the army and the state is based in reality on this
delusive emancipation of men from their duty to god and their
conscience  and the substitution of duty to their superior officer
for all other duties 

this  then  is the foundation of the belief of the lower classes
that the existing r√©gime so fatal for them is the r√©gime which
ought to exist  and which they ought therefore to support even by
torture and murder 

this belief is founded on a conscious deception practiced on them
by the higher classes 

and it cannot be otherwise   to compel the lower classes  which
are more numerous  to oppress and ill treat themselves  even at
the cost of actions opposed to their conscience  it was necessary
to deceive them   and it has been done accordingly 

not many days ago i saw once more this shameless deception being
openly practiced  and once more i marveled that it could be
practiced so easily and impudently 

at the beginning of november  as i was passing through toula  i
saw once again at the gates of the zemsky courthouse the crowd of
peasants i had so often seen before  and heard the drunken shouts
of the men mingled with the pitiful lamentations of their wives
and mothers   it was the recruiting session 

i can never pass by the spectacle   it attracts me by a kind of
fascination of repulsion   i again went into the crowd  took my
stand among the peasants  looked about and asked questions   and
once again i was amazed that this hideous crime can be perpetrated
so easily in broad daylight and in the midst of a large town 

as the custom is every year  in all the villages and hamlets of
the one hundred millions of russians  on the 1st of november  the
village elders had assembled the young men inscribed on the lists 
often their own sons among them  and had brought them to the town 

on the road the recruits have been drinking without intermission 
unchecked by the elders  who feel that going on such an insane
errand  abandoning their wives and mothers and renouncing all they
hold sacred in order to become a senseless instrument of
destruction  would be too agonizing if they were not stupefied
with spirits 

and so they have come  drinking  swearing  singing  fighting and
scuffling with one another   they have spent the night in taverns 
in the morning they have slept off their drunkenness and have
gathered together at the zemsky courthouse 

some of them  in new sheepskin pelisses  with knitted scarves
round their necks  their eyes swollen from drinking  are shouting
wildly to one another to show their courage  others  crowded near
the door  are quietly and mournfully waiting their turn  between
their weeping wives and mothers i had chanced upon the day of the
actual enrolling  that is  the examination of those whose names
are on the list  others meantime were crowding into the hall of
the recruiting office 

inside the office the work was going on rapidly   the door is
opened and the guard calls piotr sidorov   piotr sidorov starts 
crosses himself  and goes into a little room with a glass door 
where the conscripts undress   a comrade of piotr sidorovs  who
has just been passed for service  and come naked out of the
revision office  is dressing hurriedly  his teeth chattering 
sidorov has already heard the news  and can see from his face too
that he has been taken   he wants to ask him questions  but they
hurry him and tell him to make haste and undress   he throws off
his pelisse  slips his boots off his feet  takes off his waistcoat
and draws his shirt over his head  and naked  trembling all over 
and exhaling an odor of tobacco  spirits  and sweat  goes into the
revision office  not knowing what to do with his brawny bare arms 

directly facing him in the revision office hangs in a great gold
frame a portrait of the tzar in full uniform with decorations  and
in the corner a little portrait of christ in a shirt and a crown
of thorns   in the middle of the room is a table covered with
green cloth  on which there are papers lying and a threecornered
ornament surmounted by an eaglethe zertzal  round the table are
sitting the revising officers  looking collected and indifferent 
one is smoking a cigarette  another is looking through some
papers   directly sidorov comes in  a guard goes up to him  places
him under the measuring frame  raising him under his chin  and
straightening his legs 

the man with the cigarettehe is the doctorcomes up  and without
looking at the recruits face  but somewhere beyond it  feels his body
over with an air of disgust  measures him  tests him  tells the guard to
open his mouth  tells him to breathe  to speak  someone notes something
down  at last without having once looked him in the face the doctor
says  right  next one  and with a weary air sits down again at the
table  the soldiers again hustle and hurry the lad  he somehow gets into
his trousers  wraps his feet in rags  puts on his boots  looks for his
scarf and cap  and bundles his pelisse under his arm  then they lead him
into the main hall  shutting him off apart from the rest by a bench 
behind which all the conscripts who have been passed for service are
waiting  another village lad like himself  but from a distant province 
now a soldier armed with a gun with a sharppointed bayonet at the end 
keeps watch over him  ready to run him through the body if he should
think of trying to escape 

meantime the crowd of fathers  mothers  and wives  hustled by the
police  are pressing round the doors to hear whose lad has been
taken  whose is let off   one of the rejected comes out and
announces that piotr is taken  and at once a shrill cry is heard
from piotrs young wife  for whom this word taken means
separation for four or five years  the life of a soldiers wife as
a servant  often a prostitute 

but here comes a man along the street with flowing hair and in a
peculiar dress  who gets out of his droskhy and goes into the
zemsky courthouse   the police clear a way for him through the
crowd   it is the reverend father come to administer the oath 
and this father  who has been persuaded that he is specially and
exclusively devoted to the service of christ  and who  for the
most part  does not himself see the deception in which he lives 
goes into the hall where the conscripts are waiting   he throws
round him a kind of curtain of brocade  pulls his long hair out
over it  opens the very gospel in which swearing is forbidden 
takes the cross  the very cross on which christ was crucified
because he would not do what this false servant of his is telling
men to do  and puts them on the lectern   and all these unhappy 
defenseless  and deluded lads repeat after him the lie  which he
utters with the assurance of familiarity 

he reads and they repeat after him

i promise and swear by almighty god upon his holy gospel  etc  
to defend  etc   and that is  to murder anyone i am told to  and
to do everything i am told by men i know nothing of  and who care
nothing for me except as an instrument for perpetrating the crimes
by which they are kept in their position of power  and my brothers
in their condition of misery   all the conscripts repeat these
ferocious  words without thinking   and  then  the socalled
father goes away with a sense of having correctly and
conscientiously done his duty   and all these poor deluded lads
believe that these nonsensical and incomprehensible words which
they have just uttered set them free for the whole time of their
service from their duties as men  and lay upon them fresh and more
binding duties as soldiers 

and this crime is perpetrated publicly and no one cries out to the
deceiving and the deceived think what you are doing  this is the
basest  falsest lie  by which not bodies only  but souls too  are
destroyed 

no one does this   on the contrary  when all have been enrolled 
and they are to be let out again  the military officer goes with a
confident and majestic air into the hall where the drunken 
cheated lads are shut up  and cries in a bold  military voice
your health  my lads   i congratulate you on serving the tzar 
and they  poor fellows someone has given them a hint beforehand 
mutter awkwardly  their voices thick with drink  something to the
effect that they are glad 

meantime the crowd of fathers  mothers  and wives is standing at
the doors waiting   the women keep their tearful eyes fixed on the
doors   they open at last  and out come the conscripts  unsteady 
but trying to put a good face on it   here are piotr and vania and
makar trying not to look their dear ones in the face   nothing is
heard but the wailing of the wives and mothers   some of the lads
embrace them and weep with them  others make a show of courage 
and others try to comfort them 

the wives and mothers  knowing that they will be left for three 
four  or five years without their breadwinners  weep and rehearse
their woes aloud   the fathers say little   they only utter a
clucking sound with their tongues and sigh mournfully  knowing
that they will see no more of the steady lads they have reared and
trained to help them  that they will come back not the same quiet
hardworking laborers  but for the most part conceited and
demoralized  unfitted for their simple life 

and then all the crowd get into their sledges again and move away
down the street to the taverns and pothouses  and louder than
ever sounds the medley of singing and sobbing  drunken shouts  and
the wailing of the wives and mothers  the sounds of the accordeon
and oaths   they all turn into the taverns  whose revenues go to
the government  and the drinking bout begins  which stifles their
sense of the wrong which is being done them 

for two or three weeks they go on living at home  and most of that
time they are jaunting  that is  drinking 

on a fixed day they collect them  drive them together like a flock
of sheep  and begin to train them in the military exercises and
drill   their teachers are fellows like themselves  only deceived
and brutalized two or three years sooner   the means of
instruction are deception  stupefaction  blows  and vodk   and
before a year has passed these good  intelligent  healthyminded
lads will be as brutal beings as their instructors 

come  now  suppose your father were arrested and tried to make
his escape  i asked a young soldier 

i should run him through with my bayonet  he answered with the
foolish intonation peculiar to soldiers  and if he made off  i
ought to shoot him  he added  obviously proud of knowing what he
must do if his father were escaping 

and when a goodhearted lad has been brought to a state lower than
that of a brute  he is just what is wanted by those who use him as
an instrument of violence   he is ready  the man has been
destroyed and a new instrument of violence has been created   and
all this is done every year  every autumn  everywhere  through all
russia in broad daylight in the midst of large towns  where all
may see it  and the deception is so clever  so skillful  that
though all men know the infamy of it in their hearts  and see all
its horrible results  they cannot throw it off and be free 

when ones eyes are opened to this awful deception practiced upon
us  one marvels that the teachers of the christian religion and of
morals  the instructors of youth  or even the goodhearted and
intelligent parents who are to be found in every society  can
teach any kind of morality in a society in which it is openly
admitted it is so admitted  under all governments and all
churches that murder and torture form an indispensable element in
the life of all  and that there must always be special men trained
to kill their fellows  and that any one of us may have to become
such a trained assassin 

how can children  youths  and people generally be taught any kind
of moralitynot to speak of teaching in the spirit of
christianityside by side with the doctrine that murder is
necessary for the public weal  and therefore legitimate  and that
there are men  of whom each of us may have to be one  whose duty
is to murder and torture and commit all sorts of crimes at the
will of those who are in possession of authority   if this is so 
and one can and ought to murder and torture  there is not  and
cannot be  any kind of moral law  but only the law that might is
right   and this is just how it is   in reality that is the
doctrinejustified to some by the theory of the struggle for
existencewhich reigns in our society 

and  indeed  what sort of ethical doctrine could admit the
legitimacy of murder for any object whatever   it is as impossible
as a theory of mathematics admitting that two is equal to three 

there may be a semblance of mathematics admitting that two is
equal to three  but there can be no real science of mathematics 
and there can only be a semblance of ethics in which murder in the
shape of war and the execution of criminals is allowed  but no
true ethics   the recognition of the life of every man as sacred
is the first and only basis of all ethics 

the doctrine of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth has been
abrogated by christianity  because it is the justification of
immorality  and a mere semblance of equity  and has no real
meaning   life is a value which has no weight nor size  and cannot
be compared to any other  and so there is no sense in destroying a
life for a life   besides  every social law aims at the
amelioration of mans life   what way  then  can the annihilation
of the life of some men ameliorate mens life   annihilation of
life cannot be a means of the amelioration of life  it is a
suicidal act 

to destroy another life for the sake of justice is as though a
man  to repair the misfortune of losing one arm  should cut off
the other arm for the sake of equity 

but putting aside the sin of deluding men into regarding the most
awful crime as a duty  putting aside the revolting sin of using
the name and authority of christ to sanction what he most
condemned  not to speak of the curse on those who cause these
little ones to offendhow can people who cherish their own way
of life  their progress  even from the point of view of their
personal security  allow the formation in their midst of an
overwhelming force as senseless  cruel  and destructive as every
government is organized on the basis of an army   even the most
cruel band of brigands is not so much to be dreaded as such a
government 

the power of every brigand chief is at least so far limited that
the men of his band preserve at least some human liberty  and can
refuse to commit acts opposed to their conscience   but  owing to
the perfection to which the discipline of the army has been
brought  there is no limit to check men who form part of a
regularly organized government   there are no crimes so revolting
that they would not readily be committed by men who form part of a
government or army  at the will of anyone such as boulanger 
napoleon  or pougachef who may chance to be at their head 

often when one sees conscription levies  military drills and
maneuvers  police officers with loaded revolvers  and sentinels at
their posts with bayonets on their rifles  when one hears for
whole days at a time as i hear it in hamovniky where i live the
whistle of balls and the dull thud as they fall in the sand  when
one sees in the midst of a town where any effort at violence in
selfdefense is forbidden  where the sale of powder and of
chemicals  where furious driving and practicing as a doctor
without a diploma  and so on  are not allowed  thousands of
disciplined troops  trained to murder  and subject to one mans
will  one asks oneself how can people who prize their security
quietly allow it  and put up with it   apart from the immorality
and evil effects of it  nothing can possibly be more unsafe   what
are people thinking about   i dont mean now christians  ministers
of religion  philanthropists  and moralists  but simply people who
value their life  their security  and their comfort   this
organization  we know  will work just as well in one mans hands
as anothers   today  let us assume  power is in the hands of a
ruler who can be endured  but tomorrow it may be seized by a
biron  an elizabeth  a catherine  a pougachef  a napoleon i   or a
napoleon iii 

and the man in authority  endurable today  may become a brute
tomorrow  or may be succeeded by a mad or imbecile heir  like the king
of bavaria or our paul i 

and not only the highest authorities  but all little satraps
scattered over everywhere  like so many general baranovs 
governors  police officers even  and commanders of companies  can
perpetrate the most awful crimes before there is time for them to
be removed from office   and this is what is constantly happening 

one involuntarily asks how can men let it go on  not from higher
considerations only  but from regard to their own safety 

the answer to this question is that it is not all people who do
tolerate it somethe greater proportiondeluded and submissive 
have no choice and have to tolerate anything   it is tolerated by
those who only under such an organization can occupy a position of
profit   they tolerate it  because for them the risks of suffering
from a foolish or cruel man being at the head of the government or
the army are always less than the disadvantages to which they
would be exposed by the destruction of the organization itself 

a judge  a commander of police  a governor  or an officer will
keep his position just the same under boulanger or the republic 
under pougachef or catherine   he will lose his profitable
position for certain  if the existing order of things which
secured it to him is destroyed   and so all these people feel no
uneasiness as to who is at the head of the organization  they will
adapt themselves to anyone  they only dread the downfall of the
organization itself  and that is the reasonthough often an
unconscious onethat they support it 

one often wonders why independent people  who are not forced to do so in
any way  the socalled √©lite of society  should go into the army in
russia  england  germany  austria  and even france  and seek
opportunities of becoming murderers  why do even highprincipled parents
send their boys to military schools  why do mothers buy their children
toy helmets  guns  and swords as playthings  the peasants children
never play at soldiers  by the way  why do good men and even women  who
have certainly no interest in war  go into raptures over the various
exploits of skobeloff and others  and vie with one another in glorifying
them  why do men  who are not obliged to do so  and get no fee for it 
devote  like the marshals of nobility in russia  whole months of toil to
a business physically disagreeable and morally painfulthe enrolling of
conscripts  why do all kings and emperors wear the military uniform  why
do they all hold military reviews  why do they organize maneuvers 
distribute rewards to the military  and raise monuments to generals and
successful commanders  why do rich men of independent position consider
it an honor to perform a valets duties in attendance on crowned
personages  flattering them and cringing to them and pretending to
believe in their peculiar superiority  why do men who have ceased to
believe in the superstitions of the mediaeval church  and who could not
possibly believe in them seriously and consistently  pretend to believe
in and give their support to the demoralizing and blasphemous
institution of the church  why is it that not only governments but
private persons of the higher classes  try so jealously to maintain the
ignorance of the people  why do they fall with such fury on any effort
at breaking down religious superstitions or really enlightening the
people  why do historians  novelists  and poets  who have no hope of
gaining anything by their flatteries  make heroes of kings  emperors 
and conquerors of past times  why do men  who call themselves learned 
dedicate whole lifetimes to making theories to prove that violence
employed by authority against the people is not violence at all  but a
special right  one often wonders why a fashionable lady or an artist 
who  one would think  would take no interest in political or military
questions  should always condemn strikes of working people  and defend
war  and should always be found without hesitation opposed to the one 
favorable to the other 

but one no longer wonders when one realizes that in the higher
classes there is an unerring instinct of what tends to maintain
and of what tends to destroy the organization by virtue of which
they enjoy their privileges   the fashionable lady had certainly
not reasoned out that if there were no capitalists and no army to
defend them  her husband would have no fortune  and she could not
have her entertainments and her balldresses   and the artist
certainly does not argue that he needs the capitalists and the
troops to defend them  so that they may buy his pictures   but
instinct  replacing reason in this instance  guides them
unerringly   and it is precisely this instinct which leads all
men  with few exceptions  to support all the religious  political 
and economic institutions which are to their advantage 

but is it possible that the higher classes support the existing
order of things simply because it is to their advantage   cannot
they see that this order of things is essentially irrational  that
it is no longer consistent with the stage of moral development
attained by people  and with public opinion  and that it is
fraught with perils   the governing classes  or at least the good 
honest  and intelligent people of them  cannot but suffer from
these fundamental inconsistencies  and see the dangers with which
they are threatened   and is it possible that all the millions of
the lower classes can feel easy in conscience when they commit
such obviously evil deeds as torture and murder from fear of
punishment   indeed  it could not be so  neither the former nor
the latter could fail to see the irrationality of their conduct 
if the complexity of government organization did not obscure the
unnatural senselessness of their actions 

so many instigate  assist  or sanction the commission of every one
of these actions that no one who has a hand in them feels himself
morally responsible for it 

it is the custom among assassins to oblige all the witnesses of a
murder to strike the murdered victim  that the responsibility may
be divided among as large a number of people as possible   the
same principle in different forms is applied under the government
organization in the perpetration of the crimes  without which no
government organization could exist   rulers always try to
implicate as many citizens as possible in all the crimes committed
in their support 

of late this tendency has been expressed in a very obvious manner
by the obligation of all citizens to take part in legal processes
as jurors  in the army as soldiers  in the local government  or
legislative assembly  as electors or members 

just as in a wicker basket all the ends are so hidden away that it
is hard to find them  in the state organization the responsibility
for the crimes committed is so hidden away that men will commit
the most atrocious acts without seeing their responsibility for
them 

in ancient times tyrants got credit for the crimes they committed 
but in our day the most atrocious infamies  inconceivable under
the neros  are perpetrated and no one gets blamed for them 

one set of people have suggested  another set have proposed  a
third have reported  a fourth have decided  a fifth have
confirmed  a sixth have given the order  and a seventh set of men
have carried it out   they hang  they flog to death women  old
men  and innocent people  as was done recently among us in russia
at the yuzovsky factory  and is always being done everywhere in
europe and america in the struggle with the anarchists and all
other rebels against the existing order  they shoot and hang men
by hundreds and thousands  or massacre millions in war  or break
mens hearts in solitary confinement  and ruin their souls in the
corruption of a soldiers life  and no one is responsible 

at the bottom of the social scale soldiers  armed with guns 
pistols  and sabers  injure and murder people  and compel men
through these means to enter the army  and are absolutely
convinced that the responsibility for the actions rests solely on
the officers who command them 

at the top of the scalethe tzars  presidents  ministers  and
parliaments decree these tortures and murders and military
conscription  and are fully convinced that since they are either
placed in authority by the grace of god or by the society they
govern  which demands such decrees from them  they cannot be held
responsible   between these two extremes are the intermediary
personages who superintend the murders and other acts of violence 
and are fully convinced that the responsibility is taken off their
shoulders partly by their superiors who have given the order 
partly by the fact that such orders are expected from them by all
who are at the bottom of the scale 

the authority who gives the orders and the authority who executes
them at the two extreme ends of the state organization  meet
together like the two ends of a ring  they support and rest on one
another and inclose all that lies within the ring 

without the conviction that there is a person or persons who will
take the whole responsibility of his acts  not one soldier would
ever lift a hand to commit a murder or other deed of violence 

without the conviction that it is expected by the whole people not
a single king  emperor  president  or parliament would order
murders or acts of violence 

without the conviction that there are persons of a higher grade
who will take the responsibility  and people of a lower grade who
require such acts for their welfare  not one of the intermediate
class would superintend such deeds 

the state is so organized that wherever a man is placed in the
social scale  his irresponsibility is the same   the higher his
grade the more he is under the influence of demands from below 
and the less he is controlled by orders from above  and vice
vers 

all men  then  bound together by state organization  throw the
responsibility of their acts on one another  the peasant soldier
on the nobleman or merchant who is his officer  and the officer on
the nobleman who has been appointed governor  the governor on the
nobleman or son of an official who is minister  the minister on
the member of the royal family who occupies the post of tzar  and
the tzar again on all these officials  noblemen  merchants  and
peasants   but that is not all   besides the fact that men get rid
of the sense of responsibility for their actions in this way  they
lose their moral sense of responsibility also  by the fact that in
forming themselves into a state organization they persuade
themselves and each other so continually  and so indefatigably 
that they are not all equal  but as the stars apart  that they
come to believe it genuinely themselves   thus some are persuaded
that they are not simple people like everyone else  but special
people who are to be specially honored   it is instilled into
another set of men by every possible means that they are inferior
to others  and therefore must submit without a murmur to every
order given them by their superiors 

on this inequality  above all  on the elevation of some and the
degradation of others  rests the capacity men have of being blind
to the insanity of the existing order of life  and all the cruelty
and criminality of the deception practiced by one set of men on
another 

those in whom the idea has been instilled that they are invested
with a special supernatural grandeur and consequence  are so
intoxicated with a sense of their own imaginary dignity that they
cease to feel their responsibility for what they do 

while those  on the other hand  in whom the idea is fostered that
they are inferior animals  bound to obey their superiors in
everything  fall  through this perpetual humiliation  into a
strange condition of stupefied servility  and in this stupefied
state do not see the significance of their actions and lose all
consciousness of responsibility for what they do 

the intermediate class  who obey the orders of their superiors on
the one hand and regard themselves as superior beings on the
other  are intoxicated by power and stupefied by servility at the
same time and so lose the sense of their responsibility 

one need only glance during a review at the commanderinchief 
intoxicated with selfimportance  followed by his retinue  all on
magnificent and gayly appareled horses  in splendid uniforms and wearing
decorations  and see how they ride to the harmonious and solemn strains
of music before the ranks of soldiers  all presenting arms and petrified
with servility  one need only glance at this spectacle to understand
that at such moments  when they are in a state of the most complete
intoxication  commanderinchief  soldiers  and intermediate officers
alike  would be capable of committing crimes of which they would never
dream under other conditions 

the intoxication produced by such stimulants as parades  reviews 
religious solemnities  and coronations  is  however  an acute and
temporary condition  but there are other forms of chronic 
permanent intoxication  to which those are liable who have any
kind of authority  from that of the tzar to that of the lowest
police officer at the street corner  and also those who are in
subjection to authority and in a state of stupefied servility 
the latter  like all slaves  always find a justification for their
own servility  in ascribing the greatest possible dignity and
importance to those they serve 

it is principally through this false idea of inequality  and the
intoxication of power and of servility resulting from it  that men
associated in a state organization are enabled to commit acts opposed to
their conscience without the least scruple or remorse  under the
influence of this intoxication  men imagine themselves no longer simply
men as they are  but some special beingsnoblemen  merchants 
governors  judges  officers  tzars  ministers  or soldiersno longer
bound by ordinary human duties  but by other duties far more
weightythe peculiar duties of a nobleman  merchant  governor  judge 
officer  tzar  minister  or soldier 

thus the landowner  who claimed the forest  acted as he did only
because he fancied himself not a simple man  having the same
rights to life as the peasants living beside him and everyone
else  but a great landowner  a member of the nobility  and under
the influence of the intoxication of power he felt his dignity
offended by the peasants claims   it was only through this
feeling that  without considering the consequences that might
follow  he sent in a claim to be reinstated in his pretended
rights 

in the same way the judges  who wrongfully adjudged the forest to
the proprietor  did so simply because they fancied themselves not
simply men like everyone else  and so bound to be guided in
everything only by what they consider right  but  under the
intoxicating influence of power  imagined themselves the
representatives of the justice which cannot err  while under the
intoxicating influence of servility they imagined themselves bound
to carry out to the letter the instructions inscribed in a certain
book  the socalled law   in the same way all who take part in
such an affair  from the highest representative of authority who
signs his assent to the report  from the superintendent presiding
at the recruiting sessions  and the priest who deludes the
recruits  to the lowest soldier who is ready now to fire on his
own brothers  imagine  in the intoxication of power or of
servility  that they are some conventional characters   they do
not face the question that is presented to them  whether or not
they ought to take part in what their conscience judges an evil
act  but fancy themselves various conventional personagesone as
the tzar  gods anointed  an exceptional being  called to watch
over the happiness of one hundred millions of men  another as the
representative of nobility  another as a priest  who has received
special grace by his ordination  another as a soldier  bound by
his military oath to carry out all he is commanded without
reflection 

only under the intoxication of the power or the servility of their
imagined positions could all these people act as they do 

were not they all firmly convinced that their respective vocations
of tzar  minister  governor  judge  nobleman  landowner 
superintendent  officer  and soldier are something real and
important  not one of them would even think without horror and
aversion of taking part in what they do now 

the conventional positions  established hundreds of years 
recognized for centuries and by everyone  distinguished by special
names and dresses  and  moreover  confirmed by every kind of
solemnity  have so penetrated into mens minds through their
senses  that  forgetting the ordinary conditions of life common to
all  they look at themselves and everyone only from this
conventional point of view  and are guided in their estimation of
their own actions and those of others by this conventional
standard 

thus we see a man of perfect sanity and ripe age  simply because
he is decked out with some fringe  or embroidered keys on his coat
tails  or a colored ribbon only fit for some gayly dressed girl 
and is told that he is a general  a chamberlain  a knight of the
order of st  andrew  or some similar nonsense  suddenly become
selfimportant  proud  and even happy  or  on the contrary  grow
melancholy and unhappy to the point of falling ill  because he has
failed to obtain the expected decoration or title   or what is
still more striking  a young man  perfectly sane in every other
matter  independent and beyond the fear of want  simply because he
has been appointed judicial prosecutor or district commander 
separates a poor widow from her little children  and shuts her up
in prison  leaving her children uncared for  all because the
unhappy woman carried on a secret trade in spirits  and so
deprived the revenue of twentyfive rubles  and he does not feel
the least pang of remorse   or what is still more amazing  a man 
otherwise sensible and goodhearted  simply because he is given a
badge or a uniform to wear  and told that he is a guard or customs
officer  is ready to fire on people  and neither he nor those
around him regard him as to blame for it  but  on the contrary 
would regard him as to blame if he did not fire   to say nothing
of judges and juries who condemn men to death  and soldiers who
kill men by thousands without the slightest scruple merely because
it has been instilled into them that they are not simply men  but
jurors  judges  generals  and soldiers 

this strange and abnormal condition of men under state
organization is usually expressed in the following words as a
man  i pity him  but as guard  judge  general  governor  tzar  or
soldier  it is my duty to kill or torture him   just as though
there were some positions conferred and recognized  which would
exonerate us from the obligations laid on each of us by the fact
of our common humanity 

so  for example  in the case before us  men are going to murder
and torture the famishing  and they admit that in the dispute
between the peasants and the landowner the peasants are right all
those in command said as much to me   they know that the peasants
are wretched  poor  and hungry  and the landowner is rich and
inspires no sympathy   yet they are all going to kill the peasants
to secure three thousand rubles for the landowner  only because at
that moment they fancy themselves not men but governor  official 
general of police  officer  and soldier  respectively  and
consider themselves bound to obey  not the eternal demands of the
conscience of man  but the casual  temporary demands of their
positions as officers or soldiers 

strange as it may seem  the sole explanation of this astonishing
phenomenon is that they are in the condition of the hypnotized 
who  they say  feel and act like the creatures they are commanded
by the hypnotizer to represent   when  for instance  it is
suggested to the hypnotized subject that he is lame  he begins to
walk lame  that he is blind  and he cannot see  that he is a wild
beast  and he begins to bite   this is the state  not only of
those who were going on this expedition  but of all men who
fulfill their state and social duties in preference to and in
detriment of their human duties 

the essence of this state is that under the influence of one
suggestion they lose the power of criticising their actions  and
therefore do  without thinking  everything consistent with the
suggestion to which they are led by example  precept  or
insinuation 

the difference between those hypnotized by scientific men and
those under the influence of the state hypnotism  is that an
imaginary position is suggested to the former suddenly by one
person in a very brief space of time  and so the hypnotized state
appears to us in a striking and surprising form  while the
imaginary position suggested by state influence is induced slowly 
little by little  imperceptibly from childhood  sometimes during
years  or even generations  and not in one person alone but in a
whole society 

but  it will be said  at all times  in all societies  the
majority of personsall the children  all the women absorbed in
the bearing and rearing of the young  all the great mass of the
laboring population  who are under the necessity of incessant and
fatiguing physical labor  all those of weak character by nature 
all those who are abnormally enfeebled intellectually by the
effects of nicotine  alcohol  opium  or other intoxicantsare
always in a condition of incapacity for independent thought  and
are either in subjection to those who are on a higher intellectual
level  or else under the influence of family or social traditions 
of what is called public opinion  and there is nothing unnatural
or incongruous in their subjection 

and truly there is nothing unnatural in it  and the tendency of
men of small intellectual power to follow the lead of those on a
higher level of intelligence is a constant law  and it is owing to
it that men can live in societies and on the same principles at
all   the minority consciously adopt certain rational principles
through their correspondence with reason  while the majority act
on the same principles unconsciously because it is required by
public opinion 

such subjection to public opinion on the part of the
unintellectual does not assume an unnatural character till the
public opinion is split into two 

but there are times when a higher truth  revealed at first to a
few persons  gradually gains ground till it has taken hold of such
a number of persons that the old public opinion  founded on a
lower order of truths  begins to totter and the new is ready to
take its place  but has not yet been firmly established   it is
like the spring  this time of transition  when the old order of
ideas has not quite broken up and the new has not quite gained a
footing   men begin to criticise their actions in the light of the
new truth  but in the meantime in practice  through inertia and
tradition  they continue to follow the principles which once
represented the highest point of rational consciousness  but are
now in flagrant contradiction with it 

then men are in an abnormal  wavering condition  feeling the
necessity of following the new ideal  and yet not bold enough to
break with the oldestablished traditions 

such is the attitude in regard to the truth of christianity not
only of the men in the toula train  but of the majority of men of
our times  alike of the higher and the lower orders 

those of the ruling classes  having no longer any reasonable
justification for the profitable positions they occupy  are
forced  in order to keep them  to stifle their higher rational
faculty of loving  and to persuade themselves that their positions
are indispensable   and those of the lower classes  exhausted by
toil and brutalized of set purpose  are kept in a permanent
deception  practiced deliberately and continuously by the higher
classes upon them 

only in this way can one explain the amazing contradictions with
which our life is full  and of which a striking example was
presented to me by the expedition i met on the 9th of september 
good  peaceful men  known to me personally  going with untroubled
tranquillity to perpetrate the most beastly  senseless  and vile
of crimes   had not they some means of stifling their conscience 
not one of them would be capable of committing a hundredth part of
such a villainy 

it is not that they have not a conscience which forbids them from
acting thus  just as  even three or four hundred years ago  when
people burnt men at the stake and put them to the rack they had a
conscience which prohibited it  the conscience is there  but it
has been put to sleepin those in command by what the
psychologists call autosuggestion  in the soldiers  by the direct
conscious hypnotizing exerted by the higher classes 

though asleep  the conscience is there  and in spite of the
hypnotism it is already speaking in them  and it may awake 

all these men are in a position like that of a man under
hypnotism  commanded to do something opposed to everything he
regards as good and rational  such as to kill his mother or his
child   the hypnotized subject feels himself bound to carry out
the suggestionhe thinks he cannot stopbut the nearer he gets
to the time and the place of the action  the more the benumbed
conscience begins to stir  to resist  and to try to awake   and no
one can say beforehand whether he will carry out the suggestion or
not  which will gain the upper hand  the rational conscience or
the irrational suggestion   it all depends on their relative
strength 

that is just the case with the men in the toula train and in
general with everyone carrying out acts of state violence in our
day 

there was a time when men who set out with the object of murder and
violence  to make an example  did not return till they had carried out
their object  and then  untroubled by doubts or scruples  having calmly
flogged men to death  they returned home and caressed their children 
laughed  amused themselves  and enjoyed the peaceful pleasures of family
life  in those days it never struck the landowners and wealthy men who
profited by these crimes  that the privileges they enjoyed had any
direct connection with these atrocities  but now it is no longer so  men
know now  or are not far from knowing  what they are doing and for what
object they do it  they can shut their eyes and force their conscience
to be still  but so long as their eyes are opened and their conscience
undulled  they must allthose who carry out and those who profit by
these crimes alikesee the import of them  sometimes they realize it
only after the crime has been perpetrated  sometimes they realize it
just before its perpetration  thus those who commanded the recent acts
of violence in nijninovgorod  saratov  orel  and the yuzovsky factory
realized their significance only after their perpetration  and now those
who commanded and those who carried out these crimes are ashamed before
public opinion and their conscience  i have talked to soldiers who had
taken part in these crimes  and they always studiously turned the
conversation off the subject  and when they spoke of it it was with
horror and bewilderment  there are cases  too  when men come to
themselves just before the perpetration of the crime  thus i know the
case of a sergeantmajor who had been beaten by two peasants during the
repression of disorder and had made a complaint  the next day  after
seeing the atrocities perpetrated on the other peasants  he entreated
the commander of his company to tear up his complaint and let off the
two peasants  i know cases when soldiers  commanded to fire  have
refused to obey  and i know many cases of officers who have refused to
command expeditions for torture and murder  so that men sometimes come
to their senses long before perpetrating the suggested crime  sometimes
at the very moment before perpetrating it  sometimes only afterward 

the men traveling in the toula train were going with the object of
killing and injuring their fellowcreatures  but none could tell
whether they would carry out their object or not   however obscure
his responsibility for the affair is to each  and however strong
the idea instilled into all of them that they are not men  but
governors  officials  officers  and soldiers  and as such beings
can violate every human duty  the nearer they approach the place
of the execution  the stronger their doubts as to its being right 
and this doubt will reach its highest point when the very moment
for carrying it out has come 

the governor  in spite of all the stupefying effect of his
surroundings  cannot help hesitating when the moment comes to give
final decisive command   he knows that the action of the governor
of orel has called down upon him the disapproval of the best
people  and he himself  influenced by the public opinion of the
circles in which he moves  has more than once expressed his
disapprobation of him   he knows that the prosecutor  who ought to
have come  flatly refused to have anything to do with it  because
he regarded it as disgraceful   he knows  too  that there may be
changes any day in the government  and that what was a ground for
advancement yesterday may be the cause of disgrace tomorrow   and
he knows that there is a press  if not in russia  at least abroad 
which may report the affair and cover him with ignominy forever 
he is already conscious of a change in public opinion which
condemns what was formerly a duty   moreover  he cannot feel fully
assured that his soldiers will at the last moment obey him   he is
wavering  and none can say beforehand what he will do 

all the officers and functionaries who accompany him experience in
greater or less degree the same emotions   in the depths of their
hearts they all know that what they are doing is shameful  that to
take part in it is a discredit and blemish in the eyes of some
people whose opinion they value   they know that after murdering
and torturing the defenseless  each of them will be ashamed to
face his betrothed or the woman he is courting   and besides  they
too  like the governor  are doubtful whether the soldiers
obedience to orders can be reckoned on   what a contrast with the
confident air they all put on as they sauntered about the station
and platform   inwardly they were not only in a state of suffering
but even of suspense   indeed they only assumed this bold and
composed manner to conceal the wavering within   and this feeling
increased as they drew near the scene of action 

and imperceptible as it was  and strange as it seems to say so 
all that mass of lads  the soldiers  who seemed so submissive 
were in precisely the same condition 

these are not the soldiers of former days  who gave up the natural
life of industry and devoted their whole existence to debauchery 
plunder  and murder  like the roman legionaries or the warriors of
the thirty years war  or even the soldiers of more recent times
who served for twentyfive years in the army   they have mostly
been only lately taken from their families  and are full of the
recollections of the good  rational  natural life they have left
behind them 

all these lads  peasants for the most part  know what is the
business they have come about  they know that the landowners
always oppress their brothers the peasants  and that therefore it
is most likely the same thing here   moreover  a majority of them
can now read  and the books they read are not all such as exalt a
military life  there are some which point out its immorality 
among them are often freethinking comradeswho have enlisted
voluntarilyor young officers of liberal ideas  and already the
first germ of doubt has been sown in regard to the unconditional
legitimacy and glory of their occupation 

it is true that they have all passed through that terrible  skillful
education  elaborated through centuries  which kills all initiative in a
man  and that they are so trained to mechanical obedience that at the
word of command fire all the line fire  and so on  their guns
will rise of themselves and the habitual movements will be performed 
but fire  now does not mean shooting into the sand for amusement  it
means firing on their brokendown  exploited fathers and brothers whom
they see there in the crowd  with women and children shouting and waving
their arms  here they areone with his scanty beard and patched coat
and plaited shoes of reed  just like the father left at home in kazan or
riazan province  one with gray beard and bent back  leaning on a staff
like the old grandfather  one  a young fellow in boots and a red shirt 
just as he was himself a year agohe  the soldier who must fire upon
him  there  too  a woman in reed shoes and panyova  just like the mother
left at home 

is it possible they must fire on them   and no one knows what each
soldier will do at the last minute   the least word  the slightest
allusion would be enough to stop them 

at the last moment they will all find themselves in the position
of a hypnotized man to whom it has been suggested to chop a log 
who coming up to what has been indicated to him as a log  with the
ax already lifted to strike  sees that it is not a log but his
sleeping brother   he may perform the act that has been suggested
to him  and he may come to his senses at the moment of performing
it   in the same way all these men may come to themselves in time
or they may go on to the end 

if they do not come to themselves  the most fearful crime will be
committed  as in orel  and then the hypnotic suggestion under
which they act will be strengthened in all other men   if they do
come to themselves  not only this terrible crime will not be
perpetrated  but many also who hear of the turn the affair has
taken will be emancipated from the hypnotic influence in which
they were held  or at least will be nearer being emancipated from
it 

even if a few only come to themselves  and boldly explain to the
others all the wickedness of such a crime  the influence of these
few may rouse the others to shake off the controlling suggestion 
and the atrocity will not be perpetrated 

more than that  if a few men  even of those who are not taking
part in the affair but are only present at the preparations for
it  or have heard of such things being done in the past  do not
remain indifferent but boldly and plainly express their
detestation of such crimes to those who have to execute them  and
point out to them all the senselessness  cruelty  and wickedness
of such acts  that alone will be productive of good 

that was what took place in the instance before us   it was enough
for a few men  some personally concerned in the affair and others
simply outsiders  to express their disapproval of floggings that
had taken place elsewhere  and their contempt and loathing for
those who had taken part in inflicting them  for a few persons in
the toula case to express their repugnance to having any share in
it  for a lady traveling by the train  and a few other bystanders
at the station  to express to those who formed the expedition
their disgust at what they were doing  for one of the commanders
of a company  who was asked for troops for the restoration of
order  to reply that soldiers ought not to be butchersand thanks
to these and a few other seemingly insignificant influences
brought to bear on these hypnotized men  the affair took a
completely different turn  and the troops  when they reached the
place  did not inflict any punishment  but contented themselves
with cutting down the forest and giving it to the landowner 

had not a few persons had a clear consciousness that what they
were doing was wrong  and consequently influenced one another in
that direction  what was done at orel would have taken place at
toul   had this consciousness been still stronger  and had the
influence exerted been therefore greater than it was  it might
well have been that the governor with his troops would not even
have ventured to cut down the forest and give it to the landowner 

had that consciousness been stronger still  it might well have
been that the governor would not have ventured to go to the scene
of action at all  even that the minister would not have ventured
to form this decision or the tzar to ratify it 

all depends  therefore  on the strength of the consciousness of
christian truth on the part of each individual man 

and  therefore  one would have thought that the efforts of all men
of the present day who profess to wish to work for the welfare of
humanity would have been directed to strengthening this
consciousness of christian truth in themselves and others 

but  strange to say  it is precisely those people who profess most
anxiety for the amelioration of human life  and are regarded as
the leaders of public opinion  who assert that there is no need to
do that  and that there are other more effective means for the
amelioration of mens condition   they affirm that the
amelioration of human life is effected not by the efforts of
individual men  to recognize and propagate the truth  but by the
gradual modification of the general conditions of life  and that
therefore the efforts of individuals should be directed to the
gradual modification of external conditions for the better   for
every advocacy of a truth inconsistent with the existing order by
an individual is  they maintain  not only useless but injurious 
since in provokes coercive measures on the part of the
authorities  restricting these individuals from continuing any
action useful to society   according to this doctrine all
modifications in human life are brought about by precisely the
same laws as in the life of the animals 

so that  according to this doctrine  all the founders of
religions  such as moses and the prophets  confucius  laotse 
buddha  christ  and others  preached their doctrines and their
followers accepted them  not because they loved the truth  but
because the political  social  and above all economic conditions
of the peoples among whom these religions arose were favorable for
their origination and development 

and therefore the chief efforts of the man who wishes to serve
society and improve the condition of humanity ought  according to
this doctrine  to be directed not to the elucidation and
propagation of truth  but to the improvement of the external
political  social  and above all economic conditions   and the
modification of these conditions is partly effected by serving the
government and introducing liberal and progressive principles into
it  partly in promoting the development of industry and the
propagation of socialistic ideas  and most of all by the diffusion
of science   according to this theory it is of no consequence
whether you profess the truth revealed to you  and therefore
realize it in your life  or at least refrain from committing
actions opposed to the truth  such as serving the government and
strengthening its authority when you regard it as injurious 
profiting by the capitalistic system when you regard it as wrong 
showing veneration for various ceremonies which you believe to be
degrading superstitions  giving support to the law when you
believe it to be founded on error  serving as a soldier  taking
oaths  and lying  and lowering yourself generally   it is useless
to refrain from all that  what is of use is not altering the
existing forms of life  but submitting to them against your own
convictions  introducing liberalism into the existing
institutions  promoting commerce  the propaganda of socialism  and
the triumphs of what is called science  and the diffusion of
education   according to this theory one can remain a landowner 
merchant  manufacturer  judge  official in government pay  officer
or soldier  and still be not only a humane man  but even a
socialist and revolutionist 

hypocrisy  which had formerly only a religious basis in the
doctrine of original sin  the redemption  and the church  has in
our day gained a new scientific basis and has consequently caught
in its nets all those who had reached too high a stage of
development to be able to find support in religious hypocrisy   so
that while in former days a man who professed the religion of the
church could take part in all the crimes of the state  and profit
by them  and still regard himself as free from any taint of sin 
so long as he fulfilled the external observances of his creed 
nowadays all who do not believe in the christianity of the church 
find similar wellfounded irrefutable reasons in science for
regarding themselves as blameless and even highly moral in spite
of their participation in the misdeeds of government and the
advantages they gain from them 

a rich landownernot only in russia  but in france  england  germany 
or americalives on the rents exacted  from the people living on his
land  and robs these generally povertystricken people of all he can get
from them  this mans right of property in the land rests on the fact
that at every effort on the part of the oppressed people  without his
consent  to make use of the land he considers his  troops are called out
to subject them to punishment and murder  one would have thought that it
was obvious that a man living in this way was an evil  egoistic creature
and could not possibly consider himself a christian or a liberal  one
would have supposed it evident that the first thing such a man must do 
if he wishes to approximate to christianity or liberalism  would be to
cease to plunder and ruin men by means of acts of state violence in
support of his claim to the land  and so it would be if it were not for
the logic of hypocrisy  which reasons that from a religious point of
view possession or nonpossession of land is of no consequence for
salvation  and from the scientific point of view  giving up the
ownership of land is a useless individual renunciation  and that the
welfare of mankind is not promoted in that way  but by a gradual
modification of external forms  and so we see this man  without the
least trouble of mind or doubt that people will believe in his
sincerity  organizing an agricultural exhibition  or a temperance
society  or sending some soup and stockings by his wife or children to
three old women  and boldly in his family  in drawing rooms  in
committees  and in the press  advocating the gospel or humanitarian
doctrine of love for ones neighbor in general and the agricultural
laboring population in particular whom he is continually exploiting and
oppressing  and other people who are in the same position as he believe
him  commend him  and solemnly discuss with him measures for
ameliorating the condition of the workingclass  on whose exploitation
their whole life rests  devising all kinds of possible methods for this 
except the one without which all improvement of their condition is
impossible  i  e   refraining from taking from them the land necessary
for their subsistence  a striking example of this hypocrisy was the
solicitude displayed by the russian landowners last year  their efforts
to combat the famine which they had caused  and by which they profited 
selling not only bread at the highest price  but even potato haulm at
five rubles the dessiatine about 2 and fourfifths acres for fuel to
the freezing peasants 

or take a merchant whose whole tradelike all trade indeedis
founded on a series of trickery  by means of which  profiting by
the ignorance or need of others  he buys goods below their value
and sells them again above their value   one would have fancied it
obvious that a man whose whole occupation was based on what in his
own language is called swindling  if it is done under other
conditions  ought to be ashamed of his position  and could not any
way  while he continues a merchant  profess himself a christian or
a liberal 

but the sophistry of hypocrisy reasons that the merchant can pass for a
virtuous man without giving up his pernicious course of action  a
religious man need only have faith and a liberal man need only promote
the modification of external conditionsthe progress of industry  and
so we see the merchant who often goes further and commits acts of
direct dishonesty  selling adulterated goods  using false weights and
measures  and trading in products injurious to health  such as alcohol
and opium boldly regarding himself and being regarded by others  so
long as he does not directly deceive his colleagues in business  as a
pattern of probity and virtue  and if he spends a thousandth part of his
stolen wealth on some public institution  a hospital or museum or
school  then he is even regarded as the benefactor of the people on the
exploitation and corruption of whom his whole prosperity has been
founded if he sacrifices  too  a portion of his illgotten gains on a
church and the poor  then he is an exemplary christian 

a manufacturer is a man whose whole income consists of value
squeezed out of the workmen  and whose whole occupation is based
on forced  unnatural labor  exhausting whole generations of men 
it would seem obvious that if this man professes any christian or
liberal principles  he must first of all give up ruining human
lives for his own profit   but by the existing theory he is
promoting industry  and he ought not to abandon his pursuit   it
would even be injuring society for him to do so   and so we see
this man  the harsh slavedriver of thousands of men  building
almshouses with little gardens two yards square for the workmen
broken down in toiling for him  and a bank  and a poorhouse  and a
hospitalfully persuaded that he has amply expiated in this way
for all the human lives morally and physically ruined by himand
calmly going on with his business  taking pride in it 

any civil  religious  or military official in government employ 
who serves the state from vanity  or  as is most often the case 
simply for the sake of the pay wrung from the harassed and
toilworn working classes all taxes  however raised  always fall
on labor  if he  as is very seldom the case  does not directly
rob the government in the usual way  considers himself  and is
considered by his fellows  as a most useful and virtuous member of
society 

a judge or a public prosecutor knows that through his sentence or
his prosecution hundreds or thousands of poor wretches are at once
torn from their families and thrown into prison  where they may go
out of their minds  kill themselves with pieces of broken glass 
or starve themselves  he knows that they have wives and mothers
and children  disgraced and made miserable by separation from
them  vainly begging for pardon for them or some alleviation of
their sentence  and this judge or this prosecutor is so hardened
in his hypocrisy that he and his fellows and his wife and his
household are all fully convinced that he may be a most exemplary
man   according to the metaphysics of hypocrisy it is held that he
is doing a work of public utility   and this man who has ruined
hundreds  thousands of men  who curse him and are driven to
desperation by his action  goes to mass  a smile of shining
benevolence on his smooth face  in perfect faith in good and in
god  listens to the gospel  caresses his children  preaches moral
principles to them  and is moved by imaginary sufferings 

all these men and those who depend on them  their wives  tutors 
children  cooks  actors  jockeys  and so on  are living on the blood
which by one means or another  through one set of bloodsuckers or
another  is drawn out of the working class  and every day their
pleasures cost hundreds or thousands of days of labor  they see the
sufferings and privations of these laborers and their children  their
aged  their wives  and their sick  they know the punishments inflicted
on those who resist this organized plunder  and far from decreasing  far
from concealing their luxury  they insolently display it before these
oppressed laborers who hate them  as though intentionally provoking them
with the pomp of their parks and palaces  their theaters  hunts  and
races  at the same time they continue to persuade themselves and others
that they are all much concerned about the welfare of these working
classes  whom they have always trampled under their feet  and on
sundays  richly dressed  they drive in sumptuous carriages to the houses
of god built in very mockery of christianity  and there listen to men 
trained to this work of deception  who in white neckties or in brocaded
vestments  according to their denomination  preach the love for their
neighbor which they all gainsay in their lives  and these people have so
entered into their part that they seriously believe that they really are
what they pretend to be 

the universal hypocrisy has so entered into the flesh and blood of
all classes of our modern society  it has reached such a pitch
that nothing in that way can rouse indignation   hypocrisy in the
greek means acting  and actingplaying a partis always
possible   the representatives of christ give their blessing to
the ranks of murderers holding their guns loaded against their
brothers  for prayer priests  ministers of various christian
sects are always present  as indispensably as the hangman  at
executions  and sanction by their presence the compatibility of
murder with christianity a clergyman assisted at the attempt at
murder by electricity in americabut such facts cause no one any
surprise 

there was recently held at petersburg an international exhibition
of instruments of torture  handcuffs  models of solitary cells 
that is to say instruments of torture worse than knouts or rods 
and sensitive ladies and gentlemen went and amused themselves by
looking at them 

no one is surprised that together with its recognition of liberty 
equality  and fraternity  liberal science should prove the
necessity of war  punishment  customs  the censure  the regulation
of prostitution  the exclusion of cheap foreign laborers  the
hindrance of emigration  the justifiableness of colonization 
based on poisoning and destroying whole races of men called
savages  and so on 

people talk of the time when all men shall profess what is called
christianity that is  various professions of faith hostile to one
another  when all shall be wellfed and clothed  when all shall
be united from one end of the world to the other by telegraphs and
telephones  and be able to communicate by balloons  when all the
working classes are permeated by socialistic doctrines  when the
trades unions possess so many millions of members and so many
millions of rubles  when everyone is educated and all can read
newspapers and learn all the sciences 

but what good or useful thing can come of all these improvements 
if men do not speak and act in accordance with what they believe
to be the truth 

the condition of men is the result of their disunion   their
disunion results from their not following the truth which is one 
but falsehoods which are many   the sole means of uniting men is
their union in the truth   and therefore the more sincerely men
strive toward the truth  the nearer they get to unity 

but how can men be united in the truth or even approximate to it 
if they do not even express the truth they know  but hold that
there is no need to do so  and pretend to regard as truth what
they believe to be false 

and therefore no improvement is possible so long as men are
hypocritical and hide the truth from themselves  so long as they
do not recognize that their union and therefore their welfare is
only possible in the truth  and do not put the recognition and
profession of the truth revealed to them higher than everything
else 

all the material improvements that religious and scientific men
can dream of may be accomplished  all men may accept christianity 
and all the reforms desired by the bellamys may be brought about
with every possible addition and improvement  but if the hypocrisy
which rules nowadays still exists  if men do not profess the truth
they know  but continue to feign belief in what they do not
believe and veneration for what they do not respect  their
condition will remain the same  or even grow worse and worse   the
more men are freed from privation  the more telegraphs 
telephones  books  papers  and journals there are  the more means
there will be of diffusing inconsistent lies and hypocrisies  and
the more disunited and consequently miserable will men become 
which indeed is what we see actually taking place 

all these material reforms may be realized  but the position of
humanity will not be improved   but only let each man  according
to his powers  at once realize in his life the truth he knows  or
at least cease to support the falsehoods he is supporting in the
place of the truth  and at once  in this year 1893  we should see
such reforms as we do not dare to hope for within a centurythe
emancipation of men and the reign of truth upon earth 

not without good reason was christs only harsh and threatening
reproof directed against hypocrites and hypocrisy   it is not
theft nor robbery nor murder nor fornication  but falsehood  the
special falsehood of hypocrisy  which corrupts men  brutalizes
them and makes them vindictive  destroys all distinction between
right and wrong in their conscience  deprives them of what is the
true meaning of all real human life  and debars them from all
progress toward perfection 

those who do evil through ignorance of the truth provoke sympathy
with their victims and repugnance for their actions  they do harm
only to those they attack  but those who know the truth and do
evil masked by hypocrisy  injure themselves and their victims  and
thousands of other men as well who are led astray by the falsehood
with which the wrongdoing is disguised 

thieves  robbers  murderers  and cheats  who commit crimes
recognized by themselves and everyone else as evil  serve as an
example of what ought not to be done  and deter others from
similar crimes   but those who commit the same thefts  robberies 
murders  and other crimes  disguising them under all kinds of
religious or scientific or humanitarian justifications  as all
landowners  merchants  manufacturers  and government officials do 
provoke others to imitation  and so do harm not only to those who
are directly the victims of their crimes  but to thousands and
millions of men whom they corrupt by obliterating their sense of
the distinction between right and wrong 

a single fortune gained by trading in goods necessary to the
people or in goods pernicious in their effects  or by financial
speculations  or by acquiring land at a low price the value of
which is increased by the needs of the population  or by an
industry ruinous to the health and life of those employed in it 
or by military or civil service of the state  or by any employment
which trades on mens evil instinctsa single fortune acquired in
any of these ways  not only with the sanction  but even with the
approbation of the leading men in society  and masked with an
ostentation of philanthropy  corrupts men incomparably more than
millions of thefts and robberies committed against the recognized
forms of law and punishable as crimes 

a single execution carried out by prosperous educated men
uninfluenced by passion  with the approbation and assistance of
christian ministers  and represented as something necessary and
even just  is infinitely more corrupting and brutalizing to men
than thousands of murders committed by uneducated working people
under the influence of passion   an execution such as was proposed
by joukovsky  which would produce even a sentiment of religious
emotion in the spectators  would be one of the most perverting
actions imaginable   see vol  iv  of the works of joukovsky 

every war  even the most humanely conducted  with all its ordinary
consequences  the destruction of harvests  robberies  the license
and debauchery  and the murder with the justifications of its
necessity and justice  the exaltation and glorification of
military exploits  the worship of the flag  the patriotic
sentiments  the feigned solicitude for the wounded  and so on 
does more in one year to pervert mens minds than thousands of
robberies  murders  and arsons perpetrated during hundreds of
years by individual men under the influence of passion 

the luxurious expenditure of a single respectable and socalled
honorable family  even within the conventional limits  consuming
as it does the produce of as many days of labor as would suffice
to provide for thousands living in privation near  does more to
pervert mens minds than thousands of the violent orgies of coarse
tradespeople  officers  and workmen of drunken and debauched
habits  who smash up glasses and crockery for amusement 

one solemn religious procession  one service  one sermon from the
altarsteps or the pulpit  in which the preacher does not believe 
produces incomparably more evil than thousands of swindling
tricks  adulteration of food  and so on 

we talk of the hypocrisy of the pharisees   but the hypocrisy of
our society far surpasses the comparatively innocent hypocrisy of
the pharisees   they had at least an external religious law  the
fulfillment of which hindered them from seeing their obligations
to their neighbors   moreover  these obligations were not nearly
so clearly defined in their day   nowadays we have no such
religious law to exonerate us from our duties to our neighbors i
am not speaking now of the coarse and ignorant persons who still
fancy their sins can be absolved by confession to a priest or by
the absolution of the pope   on the contrary  the law of the
gospel which we all profess in one form or another directly
defines these duties   besides  the duties which had then been
only vaguely and mystically expressed by a few prophets have now
been so clearly formulated  have become such truisms  that they
are repeated even by schoolboys and journalists   and so it would
seem that men of today cannot pretend that they do not know these
duties 

a man of the modern world who profits by the order of things based
on violence  and at the same time protests that he loves his
neighbor and does not observe what he is doing in his daily life
to his neighbor  is like a brigand who has spent his life in
robbing men  and who  caught at last  knife in hand  in the very
act of striking his shrieking victim  should declare that he had
no idea that what he was doing was disagreeable to the man he had
robbed and was prepared to murder   just as this robber and
murderer could not deny what was evident to everyone  so it would
seem that a man living upon the privations of the oppressed
classes cannot persuade himself and others that he desires the
welfare of those he plunders  and that he does not know how the
advantages he enjoys are obtained 

it is impossible to convince ourselves that we do not know that
there are a hundred thousand men in prison in russia alone to
guarantee the security of our property and tranquillity  and that
we do not know of the law tribunals in which we take part  and
which  at our initiative  condemn those who have attacked our
property or our security to prison  exile  or forced labor 
whereby men no worse than those who condemn them are ruined and
corrupted  or that we do not know that we only possess all that we
do possess because it has been acquired and is defended for us by
murder and violence 

we cannot pretend that we do not see the armed policeman who
marches up and down beneath our windows to guarantee our security
while we eat our luxurious dinner  or look at the new piece at the
theater  or that we are unaware of the existence of the soldiers
who will make their appearance with guns and cartridges directly
our property is attacked 

we know very well that we are only allowed to go on eating our
dinner  to finish seeing the new play  or to enjoy to the end the
ball  the christmas fete  the promenade  the races or  the hunt 
thanks to the policemans revolver or the soldiers rifle  which
will shoot down the famished outcast who has been robbed of his
share  and who looks round the corner with covetous eyes at our
pleasures  ready to interrupt them instantly  were not the
policeman and the soldier there prepared to run up at our first
call for help 

and therefore just as a brigand caught in broad daylight in the
act cannot persuade us that he did not lift his knife in order to
rob his victim of his purse  and had no thought of killing him  we
too  it would seem  cannot persuade ourselves or others that the
soldiers and policemen around us are not to guard us  but only for
defense against foreign foes  and to regulate traffic and f√™tes
and reviews  we cannot persuade ourselves and others that we do
not know that men do not like dying of hunger  bereft of the right
to gain their subsistence from the earth on which they live  that
they do not like working underground  in the water  or in stifling
heat  for ten to fourteen hours a day  at night in factories to
manufacture objects for our pleasure   one would imagine it
impossible to deny what is so obvious   yet it is denied 

still  there are  among the rich  especially among the young  and
among women  persons whom i am glad to meet more and more
frequently  who  when they are shown in what way and at what cost
their pleasures are purchased  do not try to conceal the truth 
but hiding their heads in their hands  cry ah  dont speak of
that   if it is so  life is impossible   but though there are
such sincere people who even though they cannot renounce their
fault  at least see it  the vast majority of the men of the modern
world have so entered into the parts they play in their hypocrisy
that they boldly deny what is staring everyone in the face 

all that is unjust  they say  no one forces the people to work
for the landowners and manufacturers   that is an affair of free
contract   great properties and fortunes are necessary  because
they provide and organize work for the working classes   and labor
in the factories and workshops is not at all the terrible thing
you make it out to be   even if there are some abuses in
factories  the government and the public are taking steps to
obviate them and to make the labor of the factory workers much
easier  and even agreeable   the working classes are accustomed to
physical labor  and are  so far  fit for nothing else   the
poverty of the people is not the result of private property in
land  nor of capitalistic oppression  but of other causes it is
the result of the ignorance  brutality  and intemperance of the
people   and we men in authority who are striving against this
impoverishment of the people by wise legislation  we capitalists
who are combating it by the extension of useful inventions  we
clergymen by religious instruction  and we liberals by the
formation of trades unions  and the diffusion of education  are in
this way increasing the prosperity of the people without changing
our own positions   we do not want all to be as poor as the poor 
we want all to be as rich as the rich   as for the assertion that
men are ill treated and murdered to force them to work for the
profit of the rich  that is a sophism   the army is only called
out against the mob  when the people  in ignorance of their own
interests  make disturbances and destroy the tranquillity
necessary for the public welfare   in the same way  too  it is
necessary to keep in restraint the malefactors for whom the
prisons and gallows are established   we ourselves wish to
suppress these forms of punishment and are working in that
direction 

hypocrisy in our day is supported on two sides by false religion
and by false science   and it has reached such proportions that if
we were not living in its midst  we could not believe that men
could attain such a pitch of selfdeception   men of the present
day have come into such an extraordinary condition  their hearts
are so hardened  that seeing they see not  hearing they do not
hear  and understand not 

men have long been living in antagonism to their conscience   if
it were not for hypocrisy they could not go on living such a life 
this social organization in opposition to their conscience only
continues to exist because it is disguised by hypocrisy 

and the greater the divergence between actual life and mens
conscience  the greater the extension of hypocrisy   but even
hypocrisy has its limits   and it seems to me that we have reached
those limits in the present day 

every man of the present day with the christian principles
assimilated involuntarily in his conscience  finds himself in
precisely the position of a man asleep who dreams that he is
obliged to do something which even in his dream he knows he ought
not to do   he knows this in the depths of his conscience  and all
the same he seems unable to change his position  he cannot stop
and cease doing what he ought not to do   and just as in a dream 
his position becoming more and more painful  at last reaches such
a pitch of intensity that he begins sometimes to doubt the reality
of what is passing and makes a moral effort to shake off the
nightmare which is oppressing him 

this is just the condition of the average man of our christian
society   he feels that all that he does himself and that is done
around him is something absurd  hideous  impossible  and opposed
to his conscience  he feels that his position is becoming more and
more unendurable and reaching a crisis of intensity 

it is not possible that we modern men  with the christian sense of
human dignity and equality permeating us soul and body  with our
need for peaceful association and unity between nations  should
really go on living in such a way that every joy  every
gratification we have is bought by the sufferings  by the lives of
our brother men  and moreover  that we should be every instant
within a hairsbreadth of falling on one another  nation against
nation  like wild beasts  mercilessly destroying mens lives and
labor  only because some benighted diplomatist or ruler says or
writes some stupidity to another equally benighted diplomatist or
ruler 

it is impossible   yet every man of our day sees that this is so
and awaits the calamity   and the situation becomes more and more
insupportable 

and as the man who is dreaming does not believe that what appears
to him can be truly the reality and tries to wake up to the actual
real world again  so the average man of modern days cannot in the
bottom of his heart believe that the awful position in which he is
placed and which is growing worse and worse can be the reality 
and tries to wake up to a true  real life  as it exists in his
conscience 

and just as the dreamer need only make a moral effort and ask
himself  isnt it a dream  and the situation which seemed to him
so hopeless will instantly disappear  and he will wake up to
peaceful and happy reality  so the man of the modern world need
only make a moral effort to doubt the reality presented to him by
his own hypocrisy and the general hypocrisy around him  and to ask
himself  isnt it all a delusion  and he will at once  like the
dreamer awakened  feel himself transported from an imaginary and
dreadful world to the true  calm  and happy reality 

and to do this a man need accomplish no great feats or exploits 
he need only make a moral effort 

but can a man make this effort 

according to the existing theory so essential to support
hypocrisy  man is not free and cannot change his life 

man cannot change his life  because he is not free   he is not
free  because all his actions are conditioned by previously
existing causes   and whatever the man may do there are always
some causes or other through which he does these or those acts 
and therefore man cannot be free and change his life  say the
champions of the metaphysics of hypocrisy   and they would be
perfectly right if man were a creature without conscience and
incapable of moving toward the truth  that is to say  if after
recognizing a new truth  man always remained at the same stage of
moral development   but man is a creature with a conscience and
capable of attaining a higher and higher degree of truth   and
therefore even if man is not free as regards performing these or
those acts because there exists a previous cause for every act 
the very causes of his acts  consisting as they do for the man of
conscience of the recognition of this or that truth  are within
his own control 

so that though man may not be free as regards the performance of
his actions  he is free as regards the foundation on which they
are performed   just as the mechanician who is not free to modify
the movement of his locomotive when it is in motion  is free to
regulate the machine beforehand so as to determine what the
movement is to be 

whatever the conscious man does  he acts just as he does  and not
otherwise  only because he recognizes that to act as he is acting
is in accord with the truth  or because he has recognized it at
some previous time  and is now only through inertia  through
habit  acting in accordance with his previous recognition of
truth 

in any case  the cause of his action is not to be found in any
given previous fact  but in the consciousness of a given relation
to truth  and the consequent recognition of this or that fact as a
sufficient basis for action 

whether a man eats or does not eat  works or rests  runs risks or
avoids them  if he has a conscience he acts thus only because he
considers it right and rational  because he considers that to act
thus is in harmony with truth  or else because he has made this
reflection in the past 

the recognition or nonrecognition of a certain truth depends not
on external causes  but on certain other causes within the man
himself   so that at times under external conditions apparently
very favorable for the recognition of truth  one man will not
recognize it  and another  on the contrary  under the most
unfavorable conditions will  without apparent cause  recognize it 
as it is said in the gospel  no man can come unto me  except the
father which hath sent me draw him   that is to say  the
recognition of truth  which is the cause of all the manifestations
of human life  does not depend on external phenomena  but on
certain inner spiritual characteristics of the man which escape
our observation 

and therefore man  though not free in his acts  always feels
himself free in what is the motive of his actsthe recognition or
nonrecognition of truth   and he feels himself independent not
only of facts external to his own personality  but even of his own
actions 

thus a man who under the influence of passion has committed an act
contrary to the truth he recognizes  remains none the less free to
recognize it or not to recognize it  that is  he can by refusing
to recognize the truth regard his action as necessary and
justifiable  or he may recognize the truth and regard his act as
wrong and censure himself for it 

thus a gambler or a drunkard who does not resist temptation and
yields to his passion is still free to recognize gambling and
drunkenness as wrong or to regard them as a harmless pastime   in
the first case even if he does not at once get over his passion 
he gets the more free from it the more sincerely he recognizes the
truth about it  in the second case he will be strengthened in his
vice and will deprive himself of every possibility of shaking it
off 

in the same way a man who has made his escape alone from a house
on fire  not having had the courage to save his friend  remains
free  recognizing the truth that a man ought to save the life of
another even at the risk of his own  to regard his action as bad
and to censure himself for it  or  not recognizing this truth  to
regard his action as natural and necessary and to justify it to
himself   in the first case  if he recognizes the truth in spite
of his departure from it  he prepares for himself in the future a
whole series of acts of selfsacrifice necessarily flowing from
this recognition of the truth  in the second case  a whole series
of egoistic acts 

not that a man is always free to recognize or to refuse to
recognize every truth   there are truths which he has recognized
long before or which have been handed down to him by education and
tradition and accepted by him on faith  and to follow these truths
has become a habit  a second nature with him  and there are
truths  only vaguely  as it were distantly  apprehended by him 
the man is not free to refuse to recognize the first  nor to
recognize the second class of truths   but there are truths of a
third kind  which have not yet become an unconscious motive of
action  but yet have been revealed so clearly to him that he
cannot pass them by  and is inevitably obliged to do one thing or
the other  to recognize or not to recognize them   and it is in
regard to these truths that the mans freedom manifests itself 

every man during his life finds himself in regard to truth in the
position of a man walking in the darkness with light thrown before
him by the lantern he carries   he does not see what is not yet
lighted up by the lantern  he does not see what he has passed
which is hidden in the darkness  but at every stage of his journey
he sees what is lighted up by the lantern  and he can always
choose one side or the other of the road 

there are always unseen truths not yet revealed to the mans
intellectual vision  and there are other truths outlived 
forgotten  and assimilated by him  and there are also certain
truths that rise up before the light of his reason and require his
recognition   and it is in the recognition or nonrecognition of
these truths that what we call his freedom is manifested 

all the difficulty and seeming insolubility of the question of the
freedom of man results from those who tried to solve the question
imagining man as stationary in his relation to the truth 

man is certainly not free if we imagine him stationary  and if we
forget that the life of a man and of humanity is nothing but a
continual movement from darkness into light  from a lower stage of
truth to a higher  from a truth more alloyed with errors to a
truth more purified from them 

man would not be free if he knew no truth at all  and in the same
way he would not be free and would not even have any idea of
freedom if the whole truth which was to guide him in life had been
revealed once for all to him in all its purity without any
admixture of error 

but man is not stationary in regard to truth  but every individual
man as he passes through life  and humanity as a whole in the same
way  is continually learning to know a greater and greater degree
of truth  and growing more and more free from error 

and therefore men are in a threefold relation to truth   some
truths have been so assimilated by them that they have become the
unconscious basis of action  others are only just on the point of
being revealed to him  and a third class  though not yet
assimilated by him  have been revealed to him with sufficient
clearness to force him to decide either to recognize them or to
refuse to recognize them 

these  then  are the truths which man is free to recognize or to
refuse to recognize 

the liberty of man does not consist in the power of acting
independently of the progress of life and the influences arising
from it  but in the capacity for recognizing and acknowledging the
truth revealed to him  and becoming the free and joyful
participator in the eternal and infinite work of god  the life of
the world  or on the other hand for refusing to recognize the
truth  and so being a miserable and reluctant slave dragged
whither he has no desire to go 

truth not only points out the way along which human life ought to
move  but reveals also the only way along which it can move   and
therefore all men must willingly or unwillingly move along the way
of truth  some spontaneously accomplishing the task set them in
life  others submitting involuntarily to the law of life   mans
freedom lies in the power of this choice 

this freedom within these narrow limits seems so insignificant to
men that they do not notice it   somethe deterministsconsider
this amount of freedom so trifling that they do not recognize it
at all   othersthe champions of complete free willkeep their
eyes fixed on their hypothetical free will and neglect this which
seemed to them such a trivial degree of freedom 

this freedom  confined between the limits of complete ignorance of
the truth and a recognition of a part of the truth  seems hardly
freedom at all  especially since  whether a man is willing or
unwilling to recognize the truth revealed to him  he will be
inevitably forced to carry it out in life 

a horse harnessed with others to a cart is not free to refrain
from moving the cart   if he does not move forward the cart will
knock him down and go on dragging him with it  whether he will or
not   but the horse is free to drag the cart himself or to be
dragged with it   and so it is with man 

whether this is a great or small degree of freedom in comparison
with the fantastic liberty we should like to have  it is the only
freedom that really exists  and in it consists the only happiness
attainable by man 

and more than that  this freedom is the sole means of
accomplishing the divine work of the life of the world 

according to christs doctrine  the man who sees the significance
of life in the domain in which it is not free  in the domain of
effects  that is  of acts  has not the true life   according to
the christian doctrine  that man is living in the truth who has
transported his life to the domain in which it is freethe domain
of causes  that is  the knowledge and recognition  the profession
and realization in life of revealed truth 

devoting his life to works of the flesh  a man busies himself with
actions depending on temporary causes outside himself   he himself
does nothing really  he merely seems to be doing something   in
reality all the acts which seem to be his are the work of a higher
power  and he is not the creator of his own life  but the slave of
it   devoting his life to the recognition and fulfillment of the
truth revealed to him  he identifies himself with the source of
universal life and accomplishes acts not personal  and dependent
on conditions of space and time  but acts unconditioned by
previous causes  acts which constitute the causes of everything
else  and have an infinite  unlimited significance 

the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence  and the violent take it
by force  matt  xi  12 

it is this violent effort to rise above external conditions to the
recognition and realization of truth by which the kingdom of
heaven is taken  and it is this effort of violence which must and
can be made in our times 

men need only understand this  they need only cease to trouble
themselves about the general external conditions in which they are
not free  and devote onehundredth part of the energy they waste
on those material things to that in which they are free  to the
recognition and realization of the truth which is before them  and
to the liberation of themselves and others from deception and
hypocrisy  and  without effort or conflict  there would be an end
at once of the false organization of life which makes men
miserable  and threatens them with worse calamities in the future 
and then the kingdom of god would be realized  or at least that
first stage of it for which men are ready now by the degree of
development of their conscience 

just as a single shock may be sufficient  when a liquid is
saturated with some salt  to precipitate it at once in crystals  a
slight effort may be perhaps all that is needed now that the truth
already revealed to men may gain a mastery over hundreds 
thousands  millions of men  that a public opinion consistent with
conscience may be established  and through this change of public
opinion the whole order of life may be transformed   and it
depends upon us to make this effort 

let each of us only try to understand and accept the christian
truth which in the most varied forms surrounds us on all sides and
forces itself upon us  let us only cease from lying and pretending
that we do not see this truth or wish to realize it  at least in
what it demands from us above all else  only let us accept and
boldly profess the truth to which we are called  and we should
find at once that hundreds  thousands  millions of men are in the
same position as we  that they see the truth as we do  and dread
as we do to stand alone in recognizing it  and like us are only
waiting for others to recognize it also 

only let men cease to be hypocrites  and they would at once see
that this cruel social organization  which holds them in bondage 
and is represented to them as something stable  necessary  and
ordained of god  is already tottering and is only propped up by
the falsehood of hypocrisy  with which we  and others like us 
support it 

but if this is so  if it is true that it depends on us to break
down the existing organization of life  have we the right to
destroy it  without knowing clearly what we shall set up in its
place   what will become of human society when the existing order
of things is at an end 

   what shall we find the other side of the walls of the world we
   are abandoning 

   fear will come upon usa void  a vast emptiness  freedomhow

   upon the ocean  not knowing the route  on the ocean on which no
   one had sailed  to sail toward a land whose existence was
   doubtful   by this madness he discovered a new world 
   doubtless if the peoples of the world could simply transfer
   themselves from one furnished mansion to another and better

   one to get humanitys new dwelling ready for it   the future is

   what men and circumstances make it 

   if you are content with the old world  try to preserve it  it
   is very sick and cannot hold out much longer   but if you
   cannot bear to live in everlasting dissonance between your
   beliefs and your life  thinking one thing and doing another 
   get out of the mediaeval whited sepulchers  and face your
   fears   i know very well it is not easy 

   it is not a little thing to cut ones self off from all to
   which a man has been accustomed from his birth  with which he
   has grown up to maturity   men are ready for tremendous
   sacrifices  but not for those which life demands of them   are
   they ready to sacrifice modern civilization  their manner of
   life  their religion  the received conventional morality 

   are we ready to give up all the results we have attained with
   such effort  results of which we have been boasting for three
   centuries  to give up every convenience and charm of our
   existence  to prefer savage youth to the senile decay of
   civilization  to pull down the palace raised for us by our
   ancestors only for the pleasure of having a hand in the
   founding of a new house  which will doubtless be built long
   after we are gone  herzen  vol  v  p  55 

thus wrote almost half a century ago the russian writer  who with
prophetic insight saw clearly then  what even the most
unreflecting man sees today  the impossibility  that is  of life
continuing on its old basis  and the necessity of establishing new
forms of life 

it is clear now from the very simplest  most commonplace point of
view  that it is madness to remain under the roof of a building
which cannot support its weight  and that we must leave it   and
indeed it is difficult to imagine a position more wretched than
that of the christian world today  with its nations armed against
one another  with its constantly increasing taxation to maintain
its armies  with the hatred of the working class for the rich ever
growing more intense  with the damocles sword of war forever
hanging over the heads of all  ready every instant to fall 
certain to fall sooner or later 

hardly could any revolution be more disastrous for the great mass
of the population than the present order or rather disorder of our
life  with its daily sacrifices to exhausting and unnatural toil 
to poverty  drunkenness  and profligacy  with all the horrors of
the war that is at hand  which will swallow up in one year more
victims than all the revolutions of the century 

what will become of humanity if each of us performs the duty god
demands of us through the conscience implanted within us   will
not harm come if  being wholly in the power of a master  i carry
out  in the workshop erected and directed by him  the orders he
gives me  strange though they may seem to me who do not know the
masters final aims 

but it is not even this question what will happen  that agitates
men when they hesitate to fulfill the masters will   they are
troubled by the question how to live without those habitual
conditions of life which we call civilization  culture  art  and
science   we feel ourselves all the burdensomeness of life as it
is  we see also that this organization of life must inevitably be
our ruin  if it continues   at the same time we want the
conditions of our life which arise out of this organizationour
civilization  culture  art  and scienceto remain intact   it is
as though a man  living in an old house and suffering from cold
and all sorts of inconvenience in it  knowing  too  that it is on
the point of falling to pieces  should consent to its being
rebuilt  but only on the condition that he should not be required
to leave it a condition which is equivalent to refusing to have
it rebuilt at all 

but what if i leave the house and give up every convenience for a
time  and the new house is not built  or is built on a different
plan so that i do not find in it the comforts to which i am
accustomed   but seeing that the materials and the builders are
here  there is every likelihood that the new house will on the
contrary be better built than the old one   and at the same time 
there is not only the likelihood but the certainty that the old
house will fall down and crush those who remain within it 
whether the old habitual conditions of life are supported  or
whether they are abolished and altogether new and better
conditions arise  in any case  there is no doubt we shall be
forced to leave the old forms of life which have become impossible
and fatal  and must go forward to meet the future 

civilization  art  science  culture  will disappear 

yes  but all these we know are only various manifestations of
truth  and the change that is before us is only to be made for the
sake of a closer attainment and realization of truth   how then
can the manifestations of truth disappear through our realizing
it   these manifestations will be different  higher  better  but
they will not cease to be   only what is false in them will be
destroyed  all the truth there was in them will only be stronger
and more flourishing 

take thought  oh  men  and have faith in the gospel  in whose
teaching is your happiness   if you do not take thought  you will
perish just as the men perished  slain by pilate  or crushed by
the tower of siloam  as millions of men have perished  slayers and
slain  executing and executed  torturers and tortured alike  and
as the man foolishly perished  who filled his granaries full and
made ready for a long life and died the very night that he planned
to begin his life   take thought and have faith in the gospel 
christ said eighteen hundred years ago  and he says it with even
greater force now that the calamities foretold by him have come to
pass  and the senselessness of our life has reached the furthest
point of suffering and madness 

nowadays  after so many centuries of fruitless efforts to make our
life secure by the pagan organization of life  it must be evident
to everyone that all efforts in that direction only introduce
fresh dangers into personal and social life  and do not render it
more secure in any way 

whatever names we dignify ourselves with  whatever uniforms we wear 
whatever priests we anoint ourselves before  however many millions we
possess  however many guards are stationed along our road  however many
policemen guard our wealth  however many socalled criminals 
revolutionists  and anarchists we punish  whatever exploits we have
performed  whatever states we may have founded  fortresses and towers we
may have erectedfrom babel to the eiffel towerthere are two
inevitable conditions of life  confronting all of us  which destroy its
whole meaning  1 death  which may at any moment pounce upon each of
us  and 2 the transitoriness of all our works  which so soon pass away
and leave no trace  whatever we may dofound companies  build palaces
and monuments  write songs and poemsit is all not for long time  soon
it passes away  leaving no trace  and therefore  however we may conceal
it from ourselves  we cannot help seeing that the significance of our
life cannot lie in our personal fleshly existence  the prey of incurable
suffering and inevitable death  nor in any social institution or
organization  whoever you may be who are reading these lines  think of
your position and of your dutiesnot of your position as landowner 
merchant  judge  emperor  president  minister  priest  soldier  which
has been temporarily allotted you by men  and not of the imaginary
duties laid on you by those positions  but of your real positions in
eternity as a creature who at the will of someone has been called out of
unconsciousness after an eternity of nonexistence to which you may
return at any moment at his will  think of your dutiesnot your
supposed duties as a landowner to your estate  as a merchant to your
business  as emperor  minister  or official to the state  but of your
real duties  the duties that follow from your real position as a being
called into life and endowed with reason and love 

are you doing what he demands of you who has sent you into the
world  and to whom you will soon return   are you doing what he
wills   are you doing his will  when as landowner or manufacturer
you rob the poor of the fruits of their toil  basing your life on
this plunder of the workers  or when  as judge or governor  you
ill treat men  sentence them to execution  or when as soldiers you
prepare for war  kill and plunder 

you will say that the world is so made that this is inevitable 
and that you do not do this of your own free will  but because you
are forced to do so   but can it be that you have such a strong
aversion to mens sufferings  ill treatment  and murder  that you
have such an intense need of love and cooperation with your
fellows that you see clearly that only by the recognition of the
equality of all  and by mutual services  can the greatest possible
happiness be realized  that your head and your heart  the faith
you profess  and even science itself tell you the same thing  and
yet that in spite of it all you can be forced by some confused and
complicated reasoning to act in direct opposition to all this 
that as landowner or capitalist you are bound to base your whole
life on the oppression of the people  that as emperor or president
you are to command armies  that is  to be the head and commander
of murderers  or that as government official you are forced to
take from the poor their last pence for rich men to profit and
share them among themselves  or that as judge or juryman you could
be forced to sentence erring men to ill treatment and death
because the truth was not revealed to them  or above all  for that
is the basis of all the evil  that you could be forced to become a
soldier  and renouncing your free will and your human sentiments 
could undertake to kill anyone at the command of other men 

it cannot be 

even if you are told that all this is necessary for the
maintenance of the existing order of things  and that this social
order with its pauperism  famines  prisons  gallows  armies  and
wars is necessary to society  that still greater disasters would
ensue if this organization were destroyed  all that is said only
by those who profit by this organization  while those who suffer
from itand they are ten times as numerousthink and say quite
the contrary   and at the bottom of your heart you know yourself
that it is not true  that the existing organization has outlived
its time  and must inevitably be reconstructed on new principles 
and that consequently there is no obligation upon you to sacrifice
your sentiments of humanity to support it 

above all  even if you allow that this organization is necessary 
why do you believe it to be your duty to maintain it at the cost
of your best feelings   who has made you the nurse in charge of
this sick and moribund organization   not society nor the state
nor anyone  no one has asked you to undertake this  you who fill
your position of landowner  merchant  tzar  priest  or soldier
know very well that you occupy that position by no means with the
unselfish aim of maintaining the organization of life necessary to
mens happiness  but simply in your own interests  to satisfy your
own covetousness or vanity or ambition or indolence or cowardice 
if you did not desire that position  you would not be doing your
utmost to retain it   try the experiment of ceasing to commit the
cruel  treacherous  and base actions that you are constantly
committing in order to retain your position  and you will lose it
at once   try the simple experiment  as a government official  of
giving up lying  and refusing to take a part in executions and
acts of violence  as a priest  of giving up deception  as a
soldier  of giving up murder  as landowner or manufacturer  of
giving up defending your property by fraud and force  and you will
at once lose the position which you pretend is forced upon you 
and which seems burdensome to you 

a man cannot be placed against his will in a situation opposed to
his conscience 

if you find yourself in such a position it is not because it is
necessary to anyone whatever  but simply because you wish it   and
therefore knowing that your position is repugnant to your heart
and your head  and to your faith  and even to the science in which
you believe  you cannot help reflecting upon the question whether
in retaining it  and above all trying to justify it  you are doing
what you ought to do 

you might risk making a mistake if you had time to see and
retrieve your fault  and if you ran the risk for something of some
value   but when you know beyond all doubt that you may disappear
any minute  without the least possibility either for yourself or
those you draw after you into your error  of retrieving the
mistake  when you know that whatever you may do in the external
organization of life it will all disappear as quickly and surely
as you will yourself  and will leave no trace behind  it is clear
that you have no reasonable ground for running the risk of such a
fearful mistake 

it would be perfectly simple and clear if you did not by your
hypocrisy disguise the truth which has so unmistakably been
revealed to us 

share all that you have with others  do not heap up riches  do not
steal  do not cause suffering  do not kill  do not unto others
what you would not they should do unto you  all that has been said
not eighteen hundred  but five thousand years ago  and there could
be no doubt of the truth of this law if it were not for hypocrisy 
except for hypocrisy men could not have failed  if not to put the
law in practice  at least to recognize it  and admit that it is
wrong not to put it in practice 

but you will say that there is the public good to be considered 
and that on that account one must not and ought not to conform to
these principles  for the public good one may commit acts of
violence and murder   it is better for one man to die than that
the whole people perish  you will say like caiaphas  and you sign
the sentence of death of one man  of a second  and a third  you
load your gun against this man who is to perish for the public
good  you imprison him  you take his possessions   you say that
you commit these acts of cruelty because you are a part of the
society and of the state  that it is your duty to serve them  and
as landowner  judge  emperor  or soldier to conform to their laws 
but besides belonging to the state and having duties created by
that position  you belong also to eternity and to god  who also
lays duties upon you   and just as your duties to your family and
to society are subordinate to your superior duties to the state 
in the same way the latter must necessarily be subordinated to the
duties dictated to you by the eternal life and by god   and just
as it would be senseless to pull up the telegraph posts for fuel
for a family or society and thus to increase its welfare at the
expense of public interests  in the same way it is senseless to do
violence  to execute  and to murder to increase the welfare of the
nation  because that is at the expense of the interests of
humanity 

your duties as a citizen cannot but be subordinated to the
superior obligations of the eternal life of god  and cannot be in
opposition to them   as christs disciples said eighteen centuries
ago whether it be right in the sight of god to hearken unto you
more than unto god  judge ye acts iv  19  and  we ought to
obey god rather than men acts v  29 

it is asserted that  in order that the unstable order of things 
established in one corner of the world for a few men  may not be
destroyed  you ought to commit acts of violence which destroy the
eternal and immutable order established by god and by reason   can
that possibly be 

and therefore you cannot but reflect on your position as
landowner  manufacturer  judge  emperor  president  minister 
priest  and soldier  which is bound up with violence  deception 
and murder  and recognize its unlawfulness 

i do not say that if you are a landowner you are bound to give up
your lands immediately to the poor  if a capitalist or
manufacturer  your money to your workpeople  or that if you are
tzar  minister  official  judge  or general  you are bound to
renounce immediately the advantages of your position  or if a
soldier  on whom all the system of violence is based  to refuse
immediately to obey in spite of all the dangers of
insubordination 

if you do so  you will be doing the best thing possible   but it
may happen  and it is most likely  that you will not have the
strength to do so   you have relations  a family  subordinates and
superiors  you are under an influence so powerful that you cannot
shake it off  but you can always recognize the truth and refuse to
tell a lie about it   you need not declare that you are remaining
a landowner  manufacturer  merchant  artist  or writer because it
is useful to mankind  that you are governor  prosecutor  or tzar 
not because it is agreeable to you  because you are used to it 
but for the public good  that you continue to be a soldier  not
from fear of punishment  but because you consider the army
necessary to society   you can always avoid lying in this way to
yourself and to others  and you ought to do so  because the one
aim of your life ought to be to purify yourself from falsehood and
to confess the truth   and you need only do that and your
situation will change directly of itself 

there is one thing  and only one thing  in which it is granted to
you to be free in life  all else being beyond your power that is
to recognize and profess the truth 

and yet simply from the fact that other men as misguided and as
pitiful creatures as yourself have made you soldier  tzar 
landowner  capitalist  priest  or general  you undertake to commit
acts of violence obviously opposed to your reason and your heart 
to base your existence on the misfortunes of others  and above
all  instead of filling the one duty of your life  recognizing and
professing the truth  you feign not to recognize it and disguise
it from yourself and others 

and what are the conditions in which you are doing this   you who
may die any instant  you sign sentences of death  you declare war 
you take part in it  you judge  you punish  you plunder the
working people  you live luxuriously in the midst of the poor  and
teach weak men who have confidence in you that this must be so 
that the duty of men is to do this  and yet it may happen at the
moment when you are acting thus that a bacterium or a bull may
attack you and you will fall and die  losing forever the chance of
repairing the harm you have done to others  and above all to
yourself  in uselessly wasting a life which has been given you
only once in eternity  without having accomplished the only thing
you ought to have done 

however commonplace and out of date it may seem to us  however
confused we may be by hypocrisy and by the hypnotic suggestion
which results from it  nothing can destroy the certainty of this
simple and clearly defined truth   no external conditions can
guarantee our life  which is attended with inevitable sufferings
and infallibly terminated by death  and which consequently can
have no significance except in the constant accomplishment of what
is demanded by the power which has placed us in life with a sole
certain guidethe rational conscience 

that is why that power cannot require of us what is irrational and
impossible the organization of our temporary external life  the
life of society or of the state   that power demands of us only
what is reasonable  certain  and possible to serve the kingdom of
god  that is  to contribute to the establishment of the greatest
possible union between all living beingsa union possible only in
the truth  and to recognize and to profess the revealed truth 
which is always in our power 

but seek ye first the kingdom of god  and his righteousness  and
all these things shall be added unto you  matt  vi  33 

the sole meaning of life is to serve humanity by contributing to
the establishment of the kingdom of god  which can only be done by
the recognition and profession of the truth by every man 

the kingdom of god cometh not with outward show  neither shall
they say  lo here  or  lo there  for behold  the kingdom of god is
within you  luke xvii  

the end
